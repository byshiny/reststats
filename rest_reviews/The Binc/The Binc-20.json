After attending a poetry reading nearby hunger pangs strike hard as I was enticed for a cocktail and some small plates.  Upon arrival the business appears small similar to a caf\u00e9 size.  I was the sole customer after thirty minutes upon opening the business on a Saturday evening, ergo I was serviced immediately.  My server George was prompt, polite, attentive and made suggestions for cocktail.  Manhattan cocktail is listed in their menu which is an essential basic since the drink originated in New York City in the early 1870s.  Happy Hour is available everyday for cocktails only.  The bill is submitted to the customer embedded in a wine cork with the business's postcard- innovative and a fresh outlook rather than the standard traditional black leather guest book.\n\nMexican Mule $8.00- tequila and sliced jalape\u00f1o and ginger beer crushed ice with fresh lime served in a highball.  Drink was ok, nothing to boast for greatness as it was too much crushed ice than the drink main ingredients and I am not a fan of jalape\u00f1o.  I did tasted the ginger beer.\n\nTruffle Fries $9.00 -roasted garlic aioli with mayo and ketchup but disappointedly no sea salt.  The portion was abundant which can be shared.  The fries appears very burnt.  In the NYC French fry scene, the golden rods from Pommes Frites are covered in sea salt and served in a white paper cone while competitors use parsley and chives but, disappointedly, The Binc uses neither.\n\nPastrami Tacos $14.00 - three short rib pastrami tacos covered in mustard seed a\u00efoli, cornichons, and cilantro with fresh lime.  The meat was extremely dry and somewhat stale or not fresh.  I prefer pulled pork rather short rib.  The cornichons (pickled cucumber) were microscopic small and mustard seed a\u00efoli green spread or sauce was very minimal as I was unable to swallow for the blandness.  I like the soft shell of the taco.\n\nNote:  The Binc opens late either 5 pm or 6 pm because they close at 2 am in the morning.

We both ordered beers from the happy hour menu and shared a plate of truffle fries. I'm surprised to hear complaints about the fries because mine were perfect and delicious. The ambiance is perfect for a date and is quite charming. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. They asked a few times if we wanted more drinks without being pushy. They consistently refilled our water glasses without any prompting. Overall, my first experience here was pretty good. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying a different drink and bite to eat.", "author": "Meredith S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-03", "description": "Great bar with pretty tasty cocktails and tapas but SUPER busy.

Had the burger and something that tasted like gnocchi and both were pretty bland tasting. Not bad but nothing to come back too. Beer was good and they had great cocktails so I'd say I would rate it a 3 for food and a 4-4.5 for drinks.", "author": "Kyle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-07", "description": "I recently went on a cocktail date here. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks. Their happy hour ends at 7:30, so we caught the tail end of that. My first drink was a well-made Manhattan. My second was something the bartender made for me after I told him what I liked.  It had scotch and orange something from what I could taste. Either way, it was smoky and I liked his confidence.  My date enjoyed his drinks as well. \n\nDrinks, bartender, bar back, atmosphere, all of that would garner 5 stars, but minus 1 star for the sad cheese plate. \n\nFrom a cocktail bar, I expected a little more effort.  The cheese plate included 3 pieces of oiled toast, three piles of distinct cheeses, and a handful of toasted walnuts. What it was missing was a jam, a jelly, a mustard, a condiment of sorts to bring the cheese and bread together.  Maybe I especially feel this way because all the cheeses were hard cheeses, not one soft, so it all felt kinda dry. \n\nEither way, I would go back if in the neighborhood, or for a cocktail date.", "author": "Maria M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-25", "description": "As relatively new Brooklyn residents, we're still exploring all the restaurant options in and around where we live. We've been working our way down Henry Street and finally got to visit The Binc for happy hour and a light dinner. \n\nFirst of all, the atmosphere. Very cozy and intimate. It's a relaxing place to enjoy their awesome cocktails. Try the Corpse Reviver #2. Delicious.\n\n#2: The staff. Very friendly and helpful and the speed of service was fabulous. This feels like a neighborhood bar where you are treated as a regular even if you've never been there before.\n\nFinally, the food. Every single thing we ordered was really, really good. Not just \"okay\" but amazing! Simple dishes like roasted baby beets, truffle fries, and short rib pastrami tacos were prepared and plated perfectly. \n\nSo, to summarize: I think we've found a favorite new neighborhood spot. We'll be back again soon!", "author": "Stephanie F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-19", "description": "A really neat little tucked away spot for anyone looking for some tasty cocktails and great ambiance. Close to the subway station, and just a short walk from Brooklyn bridge park,  the binc is a perfect place for a couple of drinks before heading home. \n\nService is impeccable. When my group and I arrived we weren't sure there would be a spot for us to sit as it was a bit crowded, but they made it happen for us, which I truly appreciate. \n\nAs for drinks, take a risk and have one of the bartenders make a special concoction just for you based off of what you like... you won't regret it! These bartenders have such a knack for creativity in mixing drinks, and their attention to detail is impressive. I applaud them immensely. Plus, it's fascinating to see them create a drink for you on the spot. Wish I got the name of our bartender**edit: Richard!** as he deserves to be recognized for such a great experience at the Binc.

We particularly enjoyed the artichoke hearts and the mac and cheese, especially since they removed/put the pork on the side, and we liked the happy hour cocktails, $8 each. \nDefinitely worth a visit if you're near Brooklyn heights/dumbo/Clinton hill/vinegar hill.", "author": "Tania H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-03", "description": "sexy venue and mean drink selection but the food options are kind of lacking ESPECIALLY given that this is the little runt sister to bevacco! how could they not share even a handful of the same italian treasures from next store?? sampled the brussel sprout and tacos- wasn't all that impressed. would come back in a heartbeat BUT might consider eating elsewhere", "author": "Steph G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-14", "description": "Ambiance is low-lit, low-key, swanky cocktail bar. Tables along one wall, and a wraparound marble bar. Service was quick and succinct at 8pm on a Monday, one bartender tending the whole place. I ordered a cocktail from the menu and the burger.\n\nIf you remember one thing from this review... the burger is effing AMAZING. $12. Get it before they raise the price. Medium rare. So good.\n\nThe first cocktail (High Country, some sort of hot apple cider with funky lavender flavors) was good and sightly on the boozy side. I opted for a daiquiri (not on the menu) as my second, to which the bartender happily obliged. Very balanced and just downright delicious. I'd recommend ordering a classic daiquiri if you come here on Mondays and Thursdays.\n\nBottom line: Impressive, sexy ambiance; good food; tasty cocktails.

It's an intimate and small bar, friendly staff, good for a \"get to know each other\" kind of date.  The food was alright - the meat platter was nice but the truffle fries weren't anything to rave about.  Gin and tonic was really pretty good.
