I also really like their bread.  \n\nI find that I enjoy their brunch food a lot more.  On their dinner menu, I usually get the Salade Ni\u00e7oise and it is pretty good. The one thing on their menu that I wouldn't recommend is their Chopped Mediterranean Salad simply because it is a bland chopped salad and not Mediterranean in any way.", "author": "Lia S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-14", "description": "The Heights Cafe has a winsome neighborhood vibe that I love. No pretense, just locals hanging out and sharing good food and drinks.  The menu is interesting enough, with lots of fresh ingredients.  I love their arugula salad with candied walnuts, the calamari, and the daily soups (especially the butternut squash).  While the food won't blow your socks off, it's consistently good which counts for a lot.  The service is great as well - very attentive and helpful, not rushed, just awesome.  All of my meals here have been enjoyable.", "author": "Allison N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-27", "description": "Had the crab cake breakfast sandwich, which was pretty good.  Problem is that this is child central -- why, I dont know.  One mother even had her kid come inside with a little bike and park it at the coat rack.

However, I have to keep it real: I should have gone somewhere else for lunch. I ordered the omlette with prosciutto, mushrooms, and mozzarella. It was really rubbery and did not taste good. The service was also slow and inconsistent. In fact, someone who was seated after me, was served and left before I ordered.

That was about 4 years ago.   I had one of the most delicious french toast I've ever had- a corn-flake crusted piece of heaven.  \nI've been back twice since and I'm guessing the restaurant has come under new management because they've never had it on the menu since.  \nThe last time  I was there was this past Sunday June 2nd.  It was terrible.  I mean TERRIBLE!\nMy wife ordered a platter with soft scrambled eggs and french toast.  It's either these guys have never seen a soft scrambled egg in there life or they were using eggs from a carton.  I'm pretty sure they were from a carton.  I had eggs Benedict, the canadian bacon was about 1 inch in diameter- no exaggeration.  the hollandaise sauce was so-so and potatoes were bland.  My son had pancakes which I swear tasted like bisquick mix. \nWe live in jersey now and were looking forward to a good breakfast in the city.  The Heights does not deliver!!\nOther reviewers have called it a diner I call it a bad diner.

Maybe other meals are good, but I suggest you stay away. Scrambled eggs were bland and over cooked. Sausage was very dry, almost impressively so. The latte was very much not worth it.

I went with my aunt and cousin.  They got us seated right away even though they were very crowded, and took are order quite quickly.  I had one of the dinner specials, a New York rib-eye steak with Potato au gratin.  It was delicious, the steak was marinated in an amazing ancho chili bordelaise sauce.  I also got a yummy arugula salad with ginger citrus vinaigrette and gorgonzola!  The crabcakes were delicious as well, nice and crispy.\nFor dessert we tried the Chocolate flourless torte with a brandy sauce (soooo rich and wonderful texture), and a pumpkin spice layer cake with caramel cream cheese frosting.   I need to come back here for lunch to try their amazing lamb sandwich!   Oh and there was a great sapphire gin and tonic that evening as well", "author": "Elan K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-04-02", "description": "I live in Brooklyn Heights and I've lived here for years.  I'm proud of my neighborhood except for the Heights Cafe.  I find it incredible that it stays in business with how hideous the food is.  Okay, a personal pizza...well, you can't ruin it but why order one if you can eat at Grimaldi's on the other side of the Heights?  Basically this is a tourist trap for those strolling romantically down Montague Street.  The brunch is boring, the scallops and salads and burgers for dinner have absolutely no innovation or it's overly innovative.  Spices don't blend and it's almost as if they can't find their groove.  I secretly have to say that I go once a year b/c I SO want the food to be better b/c the ambiance is lovely and the bathrooms are clean.  Too bad it's the only two good things.  Oh, one more, Annie makes the best Cosmopolitans and you'll have to have a few to get through the dinner.\nThey only take American Express!!????!?!?!?!!!", "author": "Valerie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-22", "description": "I've been to the Heights Cafe a few times for dinner, but it's been a while so this review will focus on brunch.  \nThe Heights Cafe serves a standard bunch, the food comes out quick and the kitchen doesn't take too many chances.  Buttermilk or whole wheat pancakes and waffles; eggs benny; frittata's; and a gaggle of sandwiches.  I ordered their French Toast, inexplicably topped with a pear and raisin compote that really added very little except for a punch of sweetness as cooked pears and raisins on top of French Toast is akin to a sickly sweet Crumbs cupcake.  I asked for bananas on top, which arrived uncooked and mandoline sliced...and actually helped cut the taste of the compote.  \nMy friend had the arugula salad with almonds, Gorgonzola and orange, which she said was decent.  \nOverall, Heights Cafe does a decent brunch that won't break the bank and is steps from the Brooklyn Promenade which affords great views of Governors Island and Manhattan.  \n\nn.b.

It's on a nice street (we were unfamiliar with the neighborhood) and we were just looking for a simple outdoor restaurant for a quick lunch with our baby.
