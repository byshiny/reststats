I met up with a group of friends after work, and since it was a bit chilly outside it wasn't packed. The spacing/seating was plentiful, and it didn't feel like we were sitting on top of another group. I bet this might change when it's more crowded. The drinks also have improved--I started with the frozen margarita and then switched to the spiked lemonade. The girl behind the counter asked how spiked I wanted it! So of course I said very spiked. The tacos were decent--I had the fish and the pork, and the pork was the clear winner. It was juicy and flavorful, while the fish taco was cold and sad, but I ate it anyway. The atmosphere was much better as well--there was background music and no smoking, and much better eye candy. Service was great--the ladies behind the bar were funny and kept the line moving quickly. Glad I gave this place another chance, especially since summer is just around the corner.

They sell frozen drinks for about 9 dollar and its good. Food was decent. I wouldn't eat here again tho. I ordered 2 taco and they just wasn't good. Also I didn't received cheese on my taco because I didn't ask for cheese which I found very different because what kind of tacos don't come with cheese.", "author": "Renee A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-29", "description": "Fun spot.

Also , great outdoors seating and easy access to public transit (the C line is literally underneath the restaurant). \n\nCan't give it 5 stars due to extremely long wait times and overcrowded elementary school cafeteria seating.

We ordered the steak Plato which comes with rice and beans, very bland. No taste. And served on paper plates. WTF! We ordered 3 corns on the cob. Worst ever. They were raw inside. Very hard. Now the frozen margaritas are weak. Well for nine dollars they can keep it. Let's not forget its VERY LOUD IN THERE.

The fish definitely taste the best to me. Thought the pork aren't bad either.  The frozen mojito tasted like a mint icey to me.   The beers were good the cups are small though.

Eco-friendly vibe makes me proud that I am not harming the planet whether I am wiping away grated cheese from Corn or pork juice from Cubano.  \nHowever, saving the earth and a cool chill spot come with a hefty price tag.

Meaning, if we won our semi-final game yesterday, we would have to play in the finals immediately afterward. \n\nTechnically, we lost.

It is a simple place, with basic food like tacos, corn on the cob, burritos and chips. Beers and a couple alcoholic drinks like frozen margaritas. The drinks and food are not that special (Food 3.5 stars- drinks 2 stars), but what makes Habana Outpost great is the laid-back outdoor vibe. There are picnic tables and umbrellas, a nice fountain and it is super chill. You can tell all your friends to meet you there and they won't have a problem getting in, or looking for seating (most of the time).  I have had a birthday party or 2 here and we were able to get in 20-25 people with ease as long as we held down the tables for a bit. There are some weekend nights when it can get a bit busy, but mostly it is not too busy to have a drink and a seat.\nTuesday mornings there is a toddler \"party\" with arts and crafts and water toys. They are kid friendly at all times. There is something for everyone at Habana.", "author": "Saba F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-02", "description": "Absolutely love the food, atmosphere, and more importantly the sustainable and environmentally conscious mindset of this establishment!", "author": "Zak S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-26", "description": "I went there yesterday with 2 friends.

I always hate ordering the same thing twice when there are so many great options to try out, but I think that this is one of those dishes I'll have to order again sometime soon. \n\nThe fact that the meals were relatively cheap just added to the relaxing atmosphere, which is truly one of the best I can recall from my dining out experiences this summer in New York.
