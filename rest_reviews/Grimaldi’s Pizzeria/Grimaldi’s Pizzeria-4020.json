I had family visiting from out of town and took them here for some good NYC pizza.  It was delicious and my family couldn't have been happier.

I studied abroad in Italy and consider myself somewhat of a pizza snob.  I was pleasantly surprised by the pizza and would love to have some again.  Five stars for the pizza!\n\nThe service was horrible though.  I knew there would be a line before I went, so my review has nothing to do with the fact that I waited 40 minuted to place an order for takeout.  The \"bouncer\" at the door was incredibly rude to the patrons in line.  He picked parties out of the middle of the line even when parties of the same number were closer to the front.  He ignored the people in line when they questioned him about it.  And he had the nerve to let three people who hadn't waited in line at all place take-out orders when there were at least two other parties ahead of me who had specifically told him they were placing take-out orders.  \n\nWhen I was finally allowed in, the man taking my order treated me like a brick wall.  Absolutely no eye contact.  He whispered responses despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded and noisy!\n\nIf I ever go back to Grimaldi's it will only be because I'm desperate for great pizza at a random time when the line is a bit shorter.", "author": "Danielle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-05", "description": "pizza is good.. but not worth the line..  nice view though", "author": "O K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-30", "description": "grimaldi's has a new location in a historic looking building at the corner.  given it's \"fame\", this new location does it more justice.", "author": "Foodie C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-28", "description": "I went here while I was on vacation with my wife and parents.

I was just there last week again, and they were filming for some movie. I was surprised that they were filming while the writers were on strike, but that's not the point. The pizza is worth the trip to NY in itself! I usually walk across the bridge just to work up a decent appetite to eat here. Lines will be seen, an hour or so wait for dinner during the summer months. ATM on premises, but just bring cash beforehand and you'll be fine. If you are a tourist and don't have a car, take a cab there if you don't want to walk the bridge both ways, because there's no way in hell you're going to find one on the street to bring you back. The trains are pretty far, and the ferry only runs at certain times, car service is available upon request.

It's a family style, non pretentious, classic pizza and Italian restaurant. I love the red and white picnic table clothes. They bring out the whole pie to the table rt from the oven.

The pizza is OK, I've had as good, I've had better too. The prices are good but not enough to wait an hour for. For 1 hour I expect it to be free! The atmosphere inside the restaurant is crowded and dirty, Drop ceilings and lenolium (sp?) floors that look dirty.

I love it so.  I like to go visit my boyfriend who works in DUMBO so that we can hit up this joint.  A really great time is to pick up a pie and hit up the movies in the park during the summer.

My cousin brought me here on my first trip to NY. It's so good. Aside from the almost hour long wait to get seated, the food was fantastic. We got a traditional margherite pizza.

Had to wait for about 10 minutes but it was worth it.  The pizza wasn't very greasy so I didn't feel like going into a coma afterward which is a very good thing.

After waiting a long time in the rain, my friends and I were rewarded with delicious thin crust pizzas (my favorite kind)! I really enjoyed the food, despite the cramped quarters. Perfect amount of toppings, not so much that they slide off the piece when you pick it up, and not so little that you only taste the crust. Doesn't beat Cheeseboard Pizza in Berkeley, but of course it's a different style of pie! :)", "author": "Joy C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-07-10", "description": "There's nothing I could say that hasn't already been covered by the 137 other previous reviews to date, but I thought I would do my part and give Grimaldi's it's well-deserved five stars, just slightly bumping the overall average from four and a half, to four and a half and a bit more.", "author": "Kurt S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-06", "description": "One of the best places to get a pizza in Brooklyn, and perhaps in all of NY. I found this place in my search for an authentic NY pizza pie.  You can definitely taste the quality in the toppings they use at Grimaldi's, especially in the fresh mozzarella they used.  The crust was thin, crisp, and delicious.  The decor inside was not fancy, but what would you expect from a pizza joint?  It did have that authentic NY feel though.  So authentic, I kept wondering to myself that someone named \"Fat Tony\" would walk in with 2 goons by his side and try to force me into giving him my pizza.  Boy, would that have been a fight!

I walked across the street and ate the whole thing on the steps of some law offices. (It was a small and I love pizza, give me a break).\n\nThe pizza is very similar to Lombardis...in that its Amazing. Coal charred thin crust with that balance of crisp and dougy soft, Fresh tomato taste, delicious fresh snappy mozarella, mouthfuls of chopped basil, crispy small pepperoni and nice big slices of mushroom. I think the crust might have been very slightly thicker than lombardis but I could be mistaken.\n\nObviously with the number of good reviews for this place it goes without saying but...Excellent Pizza. Go by yourself and see if you can pick up a pie ahead of the line...they might hassle you a little if you go straight into the door, but you might get lucky and talk them into letting you order. Then take it out and enjoy with friends. Or go on an off day/time and eat in.
