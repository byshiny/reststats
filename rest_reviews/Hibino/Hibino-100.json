The air was stuffy upon entry, but it gradually gave way to the cold air blasting from the A/C unit above our heads. The wait time was a reasonable 15-20 minutes, but patrons were still waiting for tables as it approached 10pm.  \n\nThe biggest selling point for this trek to Hibino were the obanzai dishes for $4 each (thanks to Yelpers' recommendations), The pork skewers were tender and juicy, but there wasn't too much lean meat to speak of. The tri-color yam noodles had a ramen-like consistency, which made it fun to try (as long as one don't expect any yam taste).\n\nThe sushi rolls (salmon avocado and negi toro) were fresh but a bit heavy on the rice. Also, one should be cautioned that the soy sauce very salty as we automatically assumed we would be given the low sodium version. How presumptuous! The fresh (home)made tofu was served warm in a small jar,  and it had a very smooth texture. It was suitably complemented by a sauce in a separate container.\n\nA friend ordered the chirashi, which came with a solid assortment of raw and cooked fish, including uni. However, since when did places start serving chirashi with duck? It seemed odd and the chirashi felt impure (to me personally). \n\n100 for 3 people including tax and tip seemed reasonable for all this food (including a glass of great tasting sake and bottle of Yebisu beer). Note that Hibino accepts credit cards but not accept American Express. In the end, it was good first-time experience with awesome drinks and atmosphere, but a mixed opinion on the food. Yet, I would look forward to coming back to try the other daily obanzai specials.", "author": "Nelson W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-15", "description": "This is my fav Japanese places in Brooklyn and since I was in the hood during their lunch hours, I decided to try their lunch for the first time.  It's quiet, it's inexpensive, and $10 lunch set is very simple.  I'm not a big eater, but even I felt I could have ordered a side dish.  The portion is small.  I was also disappointed they didn't have their tofu for on the lunch menu.

I generally get the most recent buster tempura roll and a couple pieces alongside a decent icy brew.

I grew up in Japan, so I'm pretty picky about my Japanese food. This place is Kyoto-inspired and definitely a bit of a fusion. I got the beef kakuni, and while I feel like it wasn't the most traditionally Japanese dish, it definitely invoked the same savory goodness that I remember having as a child. It's also nice to see the place actually being run by Japanese owners/waiters. They definitely pay a lot of attention to detail, and the waitstaff was super courteous.

Me and my family go out to eat here all the time so I thought I should write a review about how great the food is. \n\nPersonally, I think the sushi is some of the freshest sushi I've had in all of Brooklyn Heights. The prices are also very reasonable for how great the food is. Every single one of the special roles are incredible and the spicy tuna is the best I've ever had!", "author": "Liz L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-02", "description": "I heart Hibino. Its my new favorite sushi restaurant in Brooklyn.  The fish is extremely fresh and as my husband said, he hasn't had toro this good since Japan.  The toro (which was a special of the day) literally melted in our mouths. I'm salivating as we speak. \n\nThe sushi rice was also the perfect temperature and extremely delicate and I think they make their soy sauce in house.  \n\nFor starters we tried the tofu and the short rib beef.  The tofu is as delectable as all of the reviewers said but the presentation was a bit awkward. I wish it was in a bowl rather than a mini jug.  I thought the short rib was dry and overcooked but my husband loved it.\n\nHowever everyone comes here for the sushi and Hibino really delivers.  We had the Salmon and Anago Hako sushi rolls along with the Spicy tuna and Yellowtail Jalape\u00f1o rolls.  EVERYTHING was very fresh and delicious.  My favorite was hands down the Salmon Hako and I can't wait to go back and try the Tuna one.\n\nOne tip - they run out of the daily Obanzai quickly.  We arrived at 9:30pm on a Friday night and every one was gone so make sure you get there early!", "author": "Kathy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-04-17", "description": "Had a weekly dinner outing with my daughter.\nFood was reasonable.\nAlso I am glad that Japanese people work here.\nThere is one major problem.\nI had beer and appetizers in addition to entree.\nThey brought entree while I am still eating appetizer with beer at half way.\nThey must understand how and when to serve dishes.", "author": "Charlie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-04", "description": "We had:\n1) Beef Kakuni, it was tender and bit on the sweet side\n2) Sashimi, really fresh buttery fish\n3) Aged Tofu, FANTASTIC!!!  please note that the tofu is homemade!\n\nI don't understand other people's amazement behind the Obanzai here, the curry noodle we had (special of the day, as they change the menu daily) was nothing but ordinary.  However, I do appreciate their effort at cooking with the freshest local ingredient!  :)\n\nThe restaurant was simply decorated with a semi-open kitchen.

I ordered the Hibino Kyoto sushi plate. It came with Yuzu mayonnaise, 7 pieces of nigiri sushi and 6 pieces of the Kyoto futomaki roll. The futomaki has tuna, shrimp, and cucumbers in there. On the menu it says it has avocado but I did not taste it nor see it in my roll. The futomaki roll is delicious. I like the tuna and shrimp combination and like most of the yelpers here I never had a futomaki roll like this. The mayonnaise with yuzu taste very light and it is a nice addition to the futomaki. The seven pieces of nigari included, mackerel, salmon, tuna, assorted white fish. I thought these nigiri were rather small and the fish were very bland. The quality is not good. For the price I thought it would be the type of fish that would melt in your mouth instead it was rather chewy and rubbery.  Not what I expected at all. For a dinner entr\u00e9e it left me hungry.\n\nI also ordered the anago hako which is eel box sushi. That was okay. It has a lot of rice with the eel on top. The Kyoto Hako is also box sushi with mackerel. The mackerel was shredded and tasted and looked just like canned tuna. \n\nThe wasabi has a strange texture and is much more dry than what I am use to. I thought Wasabi supposed to have a creamy texture that melts easily into the soy sauce. This wasabi would like mix into the soy sauce and I had to scoop a piece of it on top of each nigari.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is rustic and I noticed that lots of families dine here and they do have a lot take out orders, service was nice and prompt. The price does not justify the quality. The sushi here is a hit or miss, Kyoto hako taste very cheap, wasabi is weird, nigiri is skimpy and rubbery but the futomaki is good.", "author": "Luna L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-13", "description": "Dirty, loud and hot.
