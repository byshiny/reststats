Whenever I read reviews like this I tend to disregard them and think they are exaggerating, but I hardly ever write a review, and when I do is usually never bad. But I felt compelled to, because it was particularly bad, both the service AND the food.\n\nI had made a reservation to celebrate my birthday two weeks in advance. I asked for a table in the center, but they gave me a table by a wall. I asked them if they could change us to an empty table in the middle (that had just gotten emptied up) but they said they couldn't in a very condescending way, giving nonsense explanations. \nSo then the server tried to convince us to sit at another table with a better view, and treated me like a baby trying to explain to me why that table was better than a table in the middle.\n\nThey gave us the menu and left. For about 30 minutes and never came back. They didnt bring the drinks menu. We had to ask for it. We had to call her to get our order for drinks and appetizers. Our cocktails took 30 minutes to arrive. Then we had to call them again to order our main entrees. Let me stop for a second and go over the food:\n\nThe pasta was BLAND and TASTELESS. There was no such thing as spicy sausage in it. The squash was not properly cooked. The worst most tasteless pasta Ive had.\n\nThe branzino was nothing out of this world.\n\nThe charred brussel sprouts were so soggy. It's hard to mess up charred anything. Very disappointing.\n\nThey didnt give us honey in the cheese platter. I reminded her. She never brought it.\n\nThe only yumy thing was whitefish pate which I couldve bought at the supermarket.\n\nScallops were okay. \n\nOn top of all of this, not once did anyone stop to ask if everyfhing was okay. Not a single person poured more wine when needed. We had no idea how much wine was left in the bottle. \n\nIt was my birthday and the girl just gave us the dessert with the candles and walked away. The staff here is probably the rudest and most non efficient people I have met.", "author": "Laita C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-12", "description": "Been meaning to check out The Osprey since it opened since I work nearby, but never felt a need to splurge on my lunch break. But, as everyone knows, Restaurant Week is the perfect excuse to convince yourself that you're not actually spending that much money, and then realizing you're actually spending more than you thought after the fact.\n\nThe RW meal I crafted for myself was basically a cow before and after. My first course was the beef tartare, and my main was their cheeseburger.\n\nThe beef tartare was fine, but didn't really pop in terms of freshness or flavors. There was a ton of it though.\n\nThe burger was a double patty with melty cheddar and caramelized onions, and was delicious. Super messy, and with a giant basket of fries (which were also really good).\n\nI would come back for the burger.\n\nI also ordered a whiskey cocktail since I was sitting at the bar, but it took a while since they had to go to the stockroom multiple times for specific ingredients. It was good though, and the bartender was apologetic.\n\nIf you're in the area, staying at the 1 Hotel, or generally want a semi-fancy meal, The Osprey is a pretty solid bet.", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-04", "description": "Such a beautiful location in Dumbo! I went here for a birthday brunch around 12pm. It wasn't packed, but had a decent crowd for a freezing Saturday morning. \n\nSomeone at the table let the waiter know it was my birthday, and he gave all five of us a round of free cocktails! That was SO nice, and they were all insanely delicious. For food, we all split the cauliflower and ordered individual entrees. I had the (pricey) seafood Cobb salad... and it was ok. For almost $30, I had higher up expectations for the freshness of the seafood and the other toppings. The corn on the salad was very, very gummy and over cooked. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely return for lunch/dinner for some amazing cocktails and to sample their more savory dishes.", "author": "Katey G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-05-17", "description": "Pros: Beautiful space; food was pretty good\nCons: Overpriced; they seem to treat families with kids like lepers\n\nWent here for brunch on a Saturday with our well-behaved two-year-old. The restaurant was about a quarter full, but they stuck us in a dark booth back by the kitchens. We asked a couple times if we could switch to one of the dozen or so empty tables nearer to the windows. They refused, telling us that they \"had a lot of reservations\" that day. (We were also there on a reservation.)\n\nWe looked around and realized we were in a sort of Child Ghetto -- 4 other families with kids were clustered back in the same row of booths. 90 minutes into the meal, the tables that the waitress had claimed were reserved were still empty. (I took a picture. It's ridiculous.)\n\nDespite the bad service, the food here is decent. I had chicken and waffles, and enjoyed it. It's an expensive brunch, even by NYC standards, but I suppose you're paying for the surroundings, which are in fact beautiful, so no complaints there. \n\nTLDR: This place is probably fine if you're in a group of all adults... but there are a lot of better options if you want to bring your kids somewhere.", "author": "Joseph M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-10", "description": "Love it!

We had a reservation and they had a table available but we didn't care for the location so we agreed to wait for another table. While we waited, we had a cocktail from the bar and the mixologist nailed my drink. I asked her to surprise me, she asked what I like and created something that I may have to return for (I have no idea what was in it.) We then headed to our table and the young lady (her name started with a M) was so attentive and paid attention to details. As soon as I said I was vegan, she walked me through the entire menu and gave suggestions on how to veganize some menu items. She was fantastic. The ambiance, the food, the staff, the overall experience was exceptional and I am SO HAPPY that I chose to go there for dinner. The volume was also perfect cause me and my friend were able to talk and not have to scream over each other.

The avocado toast w/ an egg was decadent and a solid choice for breakfast. We also were given complimentary hot apple cider shots (yum) and my friends ordered some of their green energy juice (I didn't have any, but they loved it). \n\nThe view of BK bridge park and plenty of sunlight also add to the ambiance.

What an incredible restaurant experience! \nI came here Friday last week for lunch, right after my husband and I got married in the Court House. \nWe came with my mom and grandfather ( first time visiting NY from Norway) and my husbands sister, two kids and their father. \n\nFirst of all, we came over an hour before our reservation. I did not call to let the restaurant know, I just showed up and explained myself to the host. ( With this I am not trying to recommend people to do what I did, as I have long experience working in food service and arriving over an hour before your reservation is just not cool!) BUT the hostess was the sweetest ever and was totally understanding and great. \n\nBecause of the occasion I had requested a nice table, and of course being this early I did not expect to get the same table they had reserved for us, but we were seated at our table almost right away! \n\nThe hostess offered to take our coats and let us park the stroller by the entrance. I dont think I have ever been been so kindly welcomed at a restaurant before. \nThe staff we passed while walking to our table congratulated us on our wedding which was very kind. \n\nWe got our seats, which was perfect. Gorgeous view and big enough for us all with the two kids. \n\nStaff at the house had written us a beautiful congratulation-card - hangs on our fridge today!- and we were severed complimentary champagne for the occasion. \nLike that was not enough to be blown away - my husband, me and my husbands siste are those \"annoying sober New Yorkers\" and when we turned down the champagne, our sweet server was totally respectful (major plus!) and offered us something else instead for the toast. \n\nWe then got two complimentary salads while waiting for what turned out to be THE BEST BURGERS ANYONE HAD EVER HAD IN NYC! AMAZING!\n\nAfter the most amazing lunch, with the best service anyone had ever had in NYC ( or basically ever!) we were guided up ( I belive his name was Elvis, but apologizes if I got the name wrong) to the incredible roof for a showing and we got some insane wedding photos with the best NY view! BTW he took great care of us during the whole stay, checked in with us and was just absolutely amazing! \n\nTHANK YOU everyone at The Osprey for making our special day feel so extra special. \n\nWe will most definitely be back, and no doubt this is our go-to when our international friends/family are coming to visit!\n\n( oh, and if you are doing a Court House wedding. I highly recommend you walk Brooklyn Bridge with your crew before ending up at the Osprey for lunch or dinner.
