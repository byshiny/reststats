This bakery is amazing! I had been having a cupcake craving for a long time. And not just any cupcake. A real, well made one. I Googled \"bakeries near Court Street\" and came across Mia's Bakery. After being intrigued by the photos posted on Yelp, I decided to go.\nAm I glad I did! There were SO MANY selections of cakes, cupcakes, cookies, brownies,  etc. They even had cake pops! Though I had come specifically for some sort of cupcake, I found myself having a hard time deciding whether or not that was really what I wanted to get. After much speculation, I got an Oreo cupcake and a Vanilla Vanilla cupcake. The price was $5.80 for both. \nAll I can say is WOW. The cupcakes were PHENOMENAL, most likely the best ones I have ever had. The icing on the Vanilla one was pleasantly light, airy and not too sweet. There were also little crispy balls on the top, like what you would find in a Crunch bar. The cake itself was soft, fluffy and had a perfect amount of sweetness to compliment the icing. The Oreo cupcake...oh my gosh. Being a person that loves Oreo anything, I was extra excited for this one. The icing on this one was definitely sweeter than the Vanilla's, and thicker too, with crushed Oreos mixed in and an Oreo piece stuck in the top. The cake is chocolate, and not as sweet as the vanilla cake, which I found to be perfect considering the sweetness of the icing. After I finished, I wished I had gotten more than two! I will be visiting this bakery very often now, each time to try something different. I have no doubt that they will all be delicious.\nHighly recommended, five stars!!!", "author": "Maylynn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-03", "description": "I am so happy I went into Mia's. \nMy friend lives in Brooklyn and I wanted to bring something yummy over to her house.

It used to be our go to place in the neighborhood did reliably delicious, decadent desserts and we used to recommend it to everyone looking for a not-too-fancy bakery that has everything. I ordered a birthday cake from here in February a week in advance with a specific inscription. I paid in full over the phone so everything was taken care of. When I arrived to pick it up, it was obvious that they had forgotten about my order, as there was a noticeable scramble to figure out what to do. Instead of apologizing for forgetting, they figured they'd just give me a cake that they had on hand, hastily inscribed behind the counter. As if that wasn't bad enough, when we got home and cut the cake hours later, it was FROZEN SOLID. Do you know how embarrassing it is to serve guests a frozen birthday cake?? All this with zero explanation and zero apology. If they had just told me the truth, I would have been disappointed but I would have understood. Mistakes happen, but you have to own up to them. As a neighborhood business, Mia's revealed a lot about themselves through this one incident: they don't care about their customers, they don't care about their product, and they don't care about their reputation.", "author": "Charlotte H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-19", "description": "Got my son's first birthday Mickey Mouse cake here.
