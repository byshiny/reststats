Red pizza was good, the white pizza had a lot of mushrooms but lacked a little flavor/salt. Waited about 35 minutes for pizzas to come out. Crust was hot and crispy. Only issue we had was having to swat away flies while we were eating. It was a hot and humid day so it was probably hard to keep the flies from flying inside. The wait to get seated was not bad and glad we went for the experience.

A few days earlier we had eaten at Lombardi's and it was good but not great so I was even more skeptical to come try another pizza spot in NY. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We got a small pizza between my husband and I with half jalapenos and half regular. The sauce was really flavorful and I loved the touch of fresh basil. \n\nI would recommend this place for someone who likes thin pizza that isn't crispy.", "author": "Tina D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-08", "description": "Excellent food!

I conquered the walk across the Brooklyn Bridge so I decided to reward myself with a nice slice of pizza! Or 2....Maybe 3, you'll never know ;)\n\nThere was a line out the door, But that is when you know the food is good and the wait went by quickly. I was with my former college roommate and Since there was only 2 of us they sat us at the bar and we shared a pepperoni pizza. It was declious!!!!! I lived It. We devoured It!

I noticed on Yelp and Trip Advisor there were mixed reviews for this restaurant - from those who raved to those who said to avoid at all costs. And I wish I had listened to the latter.\n\nFirst of all, the lack of line up should have tipped me off. It was around dinner time on a Tuesday, and the restaurant was maybe half full, even though there were supposedly hour long waits during peak hours. We looked upstairs as well as downstairs, so we had a pretty good look around the restaurant.\n\nSecond of all, service was definitely lacking. No one brings you to a table once you enter, or even acknowledges you until you ask for assistance. For a place that seems to cater to tourists, that's a red flag.\n\nOnce we were seated, the waiter was impatient with our questions. Yes, we're tourists, but if I need clarification on the menu, I should be able to ask without any attitude. He made us feel rushed, even though there were plenty of staff for a half-full restaurant.\n\nWhen our pizza came, we asked the waiter who brought it to take a picture for us. He made no eye contact and blatantly said, \"I'll get your server to do it\" and ran off. We ended up waving down our server to take a picture as he clearly did not pass on the message.\n\nWe ordered a small pizza to share between the 3 of us, and 2 drinks. We got a standard red pizza with 2 toppings, which are an additional charge per topping. The pizza was okay. Not amazing, nothing special. The pizza by the slice my mom had near our hotel in Manhattan was better. The bottom wasn't crispy and the toppings were not abundant. It came out to maybe $20 for the pizza and $3 for each drink, for a final bill of around $26.\n\nNow, here's what got me to the 1 star rating. Upon paying for the bill, we noticed and expressed that it was a bit more expensive than expected. The cashier and waiter, awaiting payment, did not say anything. Looking closely, we saw a $5 charge although we didn't get anything that was $5. So, we asked what the $5 charge at the bottom was for. With lots of attitude and impatience, the cashier explained it was a service charge. They said that at the bottom of the menu they reserve the right to add a service charge. He said, and I quote, \"We get a lot of tourists here, we add a service charge.\" This makes no sense whatsoever. I asked how the service charge was calculated - a percentage of the check? He rudely said it depended on the size of the party. From my calculation, $5 on a $26 bill is almost a 20% service fee. Ridiculous - especially because we had felt that the service was so lacking, they barely deserved a tip. The small print at the bottom of the menu did have the disclaimer, so we just paid and left. Just because an establishment decides to impose a service charge does not mean that they can treat their customers poorly. Searching Yelp reviews after this experience, I noted that many reviews said that this service fee is possibly illegal, as it is only allowed for large parties. We were a table of 3. Grimaldi's is clearly taking advantage of tourists who don't know the rules and laws. I would never eat here again and tell anybody who plans to visit Brooklyn the same.\n\nLuckily, just next door, there is a good alternative - next time I'll go for Juliana's, which was also recommended.", "author": "Stephanie T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-10", "description": "This place came highly recommended from several friends and it did not disappoint.
