I asked the waitress for a recommendation between two choices and she was a bit snarky about my question. The coffee and food took forever to arrive and the burger I ordered, and the Bloody Mary, were only ok. Good coffee though. I have no idea about their dinners but the food just felt lacklustre. On top of that, when we asked for the bill the waitress just sat and talked to a friend while holding the check in her hand. \n\nAnd while I won't hold it against them because it's rampant in brooklyn, I'm a bit confused as to how we weren't informed at all by signage or staff that it was cash only until we paid. Not cool.", "author": "David L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-04-20", "description": "I came here for brunch on Sunday and was extremely disappointed by the service. They ran out of cups, so we had to wait over a half hour for our coffee and cocktails. The waitress finally brought coffee, but still did not have enough cups for everyone. The restaurant was not super packed so I can't understand why there were no glasses! The waitstaff was pretty clueless about the food--the one guy couldn't remember which burger was medium rare and which was medium, and didn't offer to check with the chefs to figure it out. They forgot toast for one meal and we had to ask repeatedly to get it. We also asked for ketchup three times and never got it. The place looked nice, and not too crowded, so I have no idea why the service was so bad! \n\nI ordered the chicken salad sandwich and I liked it. Ny friends got burgers and enoyed them, though they were surprisingly small. We all got the bloody Mary cocktails and they were good. The brunch special is $15 for a entree, coffee and a cocktail, which is a good deal! Unfortunately the service was so terrible that I wouldn't recommend the place.", "author": "Marisa F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-25", "description": "I came in here on a Friday night with a date. Wonderful ambiance, with small candles to give a rustic, artsy vibe that would be great for a trendy first date. The waitress/bartender wasn't the warmest person at all. I feel that service takes a major hit but the place itself is not bad. Be careful and buyer beware, the kitchen can close well before 1 even though they're open until 4, the last night I came tgey closed at 2.", "author": "Alex B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-17", "description": "I love Bijan's!

The decor is beautiful with artwork. Our waitress was very attentive to us. The wings are to die for! They were literally finger licking good with some fresh sliced cucumbers. We had the salmon with green beans and scrumptious mashed potatoes. I was already impressed with plans to return when the owners wife suggested the tiramisu. I'm not a huge dessert person so I took a nibble because I didn't want to be rude. Heavenly! It melted...like really MELTED in my mouth! I plan to return for brunch (only $15!!!!!) and Tuesday evening for open mic.

I had planned to meet up with a date at a spot up the street from Bijan's, but when I got there it was really loud and not at all the atmosphere I had heard it was. When she arrived we decided to bail on the first spot and went down Hoyt St. and saw Bijan's and it looked pretty cozy so we stopped in. There were seats at the bar, a really nice fireplace, old Charlie Chaplin movie on a big screen, music at just the right volume, a lively but relaxed crowd, and good drinks. It was perfect and we had a really nice time. Our bartender was very attentive and nice. I didn't get her name but we appreciated her service. Didn't try the food this time but will definitely be back to check that out.", "author": "adrian c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-27", "description": "Buyer Beware!!!!\nI have never written a negative Yelp review but there is a first for everything and Bijan worked hard to earn this one star rating!!  There were 4 in our party we ordered 2 apps, 3 med burgers, and a kabob.  After a 20 minute wait 2 of the burgers arrived - we asked about the apps - the waitress offered to take the burgers back and go get the apps.  We opted to keep our meal only to find the cheese was wrong on one burger and both were \"very well\" done.   The 3rd burger showed up and was good - cooked to order. Meanwhile the apps showed up. We sent the burgers back only to find that they were out of patties.  We declined ordering anything else. The fourth order (kabob) never showed!   Out of four orders  one customer received their meal correctly. After sharing our disgust with the management we landed up just paying for the drinks. Not a great compensation when you consider only one meal was eaten!!!", "author": "Jonathan B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-17", "description": "Cute neighborhood spot with great food and amazing drinks!!

The food is ridiculously good, but don't show up expecting fesenjoon and kabab. It's more Persian fusion- which isn't a thing, but keep an open mind.\n\nBijan's is a great mix of locals and newbies. The food is amazing, the staff is prone to giving hugs and remembering details about your life. My favorite thing is that if you walk in by yourself the bartender will almost always make sure to introduce you to the person next to you.\n\nOr maybe my favorite thing is the \"Persian\" Chicken wings....or the hanger steak frites...or is it truffle fries?\n\nOr maybe my favorite thing is the Persian kiss...or maybe Henry's Special Cucumber Concotion....or maybe...\n\nOr maybe its Kadri or Henry or Alex or Ross or the Ericas ....\n\nI guess its all my favorite.
