A staple for me-- lasts me 2 meals.  Their stewed chicken and oxtail is pretty good too. \n\nBut whats up with their breakfast menu? Its straight up diner, no Dominican/Cuba/Puerto Rican flair to it.

I used to live up the street, it was our go to place for stuffing ou faces after a long day snowboarding or if we were crazy starving.\n\nTry this and you will feel the love: \n\nGrilled pork chops, yellow rice and beans, avocado salad, tostones. I think it will set you back maybe 18 bucks, food for 2-4. The pork chops are marinated in this amazing sour special something or other. Great empanadas as well.\n\nIf you like something simple: Get the grilled chicken sandwich, lettuce, tomato, may and grilled onions. Put some ketchup and hot sauce on there and you're in heaven. Seriously good chix sandwich.\n\nJust wicked!\n\nNote: Not quite as amazing as it used to be, but still earns 4 stars.", "author": "Interrupting P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-21", "description": "where is the grannie at? cuz usually restaurants like these, is the true reminiscence of home cookin'. no frill, spanish speaking cats just agrees  to what you want to order. i'm a sucker for pollo al horno, where the skin falls off and smacks you in the salivating tongue. gulp. oops. is it bad for you? i heard it really isn't. the portion size is true to the heart and soul where gentrification didn't change el nuevo portal into greedy inflatable monsters. cuz u know around the way now, some joints serve you your rice portion in a CUP. i mean A CUP..who does thattttttt?  serving size is also true to what a real abuela will serve back at home...fill up the plate into a heaping mountain then encourage you to be \"respectful\" so eat up.  bargain! rice and beans with chicken. mmmmmm.  honey, you can't get a meal like this any where else on smith st but hereeee-izzy. pocket changeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "author": "Davina L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-11-16", "description": "As someone who enjoys Mexican food, I felt comfortable.

When I first moved to Brooklyn, I went to this place at least 2x a week. It is a no  frills place where the food and friendly (but straight fwd) service speaks for itself. The food is great quality, clean and HUGE portions. I read some other reviews - - this is NOT a trendy restaurant serving with a huge fake smile on their faces. It is an authentic NYC eatery that existed before all the yuppies moved in (myself included). Contrast to a lot of closed businesses on Smith Street - this one has actually EXPANDED to include a sister location up the block (I forget the name). I recommend rice and beans, the Cuban, breaded steak or chicken sandwich. When you ask for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich, you will get it on a submarine roll!

Our order arrived within 10 minutes and we were not judged by the delivery man or the establishment for having very bad Spanish. Too bad the rest of the neighborhood was judging, especially the crowd that was there for \"Bastille Day\". We also acted like we \"dropped\" our soccer ball into the path of oncoming pretty women a bunch of times because we were in such a good mood and normally, 20% would be angry, but because of the great food and the good time it brought, our joyful antics were appreciated. There was one girl that was disgusted by us, though. She looked at the ball as if it were a turd. In the end, four grown people that were very hungry could not finish what we had ordered. This place is our favorite because it does not judge and it has incredible food.\n\nOur 2 lady friends that joined us agreed that the food made them forget about the handsome Frenchman who vaguely resembled 32 year-old Ignacio \"Nacho\" Figueras, only not quite as dark and probably not as good at polo, if just for a moment.", "author": "Allan L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-04", "description": "Delicious baccalao, great rice and black beans, yummy gandules and green plantains.
