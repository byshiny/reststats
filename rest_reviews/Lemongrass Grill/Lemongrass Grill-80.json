If your looking for an inexpensive Thai Restaurant for a quick bite, this is the place to be. The service is real good, they are very nice courteous and attentive. The price is def right. They give you a handful of salad, a spring roll, fried wonton, Thai tea plus a dim sum, plus an entree for only $8.95 for lunch special. You can't get cheaper than that anywhere else. Love them, always coming back again n again for nice cheap decent food.", "author": "Baobei B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-01", "description": "The lunch specials are decent and reasonably priced. I love their pork chop over rice and the pad-see-ew. They normally throw in a couple of little appetizer goodies, a small salad, and a bottle of water when you pick it up.\n\nThe service is good. The space is conducive for large groups, and the prices are affordable. I would suggest pick-up over delivery. Trust me, it makes a difference.", "author": "James W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-10", "description": "The food is solid. I don't know if it's a full 4 stars--maybe 3.5--since it's really Americanized Thai food, but the lunch special is so terrific that you really can't complain.\n\nGot the Thai basil chili dish with chicken. Came with fried wonton, salad, and a spring roll. It was $7. Yes, $7. It was a massive amount of food and I had leftovers! ALSO, a free Thai iced tea?!\n\nIf I was being picky, I'd complain about it being too salty or the flavors being a little off, but not for this price. Awesome, awesome lunch deal. I'll be back.", "author": "Dylan K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-06", "description": "Went last Friday night and had a pleasant experience.

And I should say it was a fair deal. Seriously when you get appetizer, main dish and drink for just $8 you automatically switch to mode 'I can't complain'. So I won't.

We were able to get the lunch special for $7.95 which included 3 pieces of appetizer, a salad, entree (sauteed/noodle/curry) and a drink (Thai Ice Tea as an option, I thought I had gone to Heaven....what a great deal!).

The seafood casserole was way over cooked= tough, chewy mussels and scallops. The spiciest curry dish on the menu was not all that spicy and not a curry. It had a watery consistency and little flavor. The mock dock was spongy and boiled. \n\nThe place itself is quite sketchy looking. They have signs everywhere they say they only accept chipped cards. They felt the need to indicate in the happy hour section of the menu that they offer no returns on the 2 for 1 drinks.

Their 2 for 1 drinks during happy hour is the shit...their service was great.. Form the time we walked in we was greeted with a smile and seat  immediately...

The staff always greets my friends and me. They always give us free Chai Iced tea. Sometimes they give us free desserts too. But that's because my friends and I are regulars. There was a time where my friend and I came for 5 days straight. The staff are friendly to us. The atmosphere is okay. Nice winds and clean air. Not too noisy, unless you go at night then it's jammed and it's too loud. We never had to wait to be seated. Though the waiting area looks awfully small. But good thing my friends and I never wait, since we are cool regulars :) \n\nAlso they always check ID with the chipped cards too. \n\nMy favorite thing to get is the Pad Thai. Though the waiters don't know how to pronounce English. But that's okay since there food is good and I just point on the menu. \n\nTheir Chai Iced Tea is too sugary, but hey I won't complain since it's FREE.", "author": "James D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-05", "description": "I ordered the Crispy\u00a0Pepper\u00a0Steak to go.

Their lunch special is an unbelievable deal. My lunch even came with a thai iced tea that I didn't order. I thought it was a mistake on their part (and some poor lad was missing out on his drink) but it seems as though they just throw it in as a freebie (based on customer reviews on Seamless). The delivery of food was also timely - took 40 minutes but came earlier than the estimated time frame. Food is pretty good. Only thing I didn't like was that I upgraded to sticky rice to meet their delivery minimum but their sticky rice sucks.
