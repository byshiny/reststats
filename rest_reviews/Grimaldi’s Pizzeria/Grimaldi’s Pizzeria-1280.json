You'll probably have to wait in a queue no matter what time you turn up, and you'll wonder if this pizza is worth queuing over, but let me tell you yes, yes it is. \n\nMy friend Maria and I went here for lunch last week and queued outside for about a half hour. It was really hot and there was a pizza place next door with no queue. We thought about heading there but we decided to wait it out and I'm so glad we did. \n\nOnce inside we got our table and our order was taken so quickly. We ordered a small ham, mushroom and garlic pizza, and trust me a small is by far enough for 2 people. It came within about 15 minutes and we literally devoured it. \n\nThe staff in here were really efficient, the drinks and the food came so quickly, and the prices are great considering how much food you actually get. I would come back here every single time I wanted pizza if I could. \n\nThe restaurant doesn't do slices, only whole pizzas, and don't do delivery, but do do takeaway!", "author": "Martyn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-13", "description": "This is supposed to be one of the best pizza places in New York, but I didn't think so. The pizza was bland and boring. The host was rude. I was waiting in line with my dog while my fiance went to the atm. The host said \"I can't seat you. You have dog\". I said i understand and was just here to pick up. He rudely asked \"whose gonna put in ur order?\" Which btw i had already told him my fiance would, once he gets back. He said \"you don't need to be here, he can come in, put the order and we can bring it out.\" It may just have been a language gap, but I thought he was a rude old man, and I am never eating there again, even if they do indeed live up to their reputation.

The shop recently moved across the street as the complicated result of a health violation. They're doing well in the new joint and while service is a bit slow, they are trying hard and there is no bad attitude except maybe while you're on line waiting for a table - the old man is definitely not a people person and probably a bit cranky after 20 years of doing the same thing.\n\nDon't be afraid to get toppings. This isn't your typical street slice where there's no point getting anything other than cheese. We enjoyed sausages, onions, extra cheese, and pepperoni, with a side of anchovies.

The two of us got on that infamous line that seemed like it would not budge. We went there knowing that and told ourselves to be patient. What we didn't know was they periodically call out looking to fill small tables for 2 and we surprisingly managed to cut ahead of about 40 people. What luck! We waited a while to be served. The pizza took a while to produce but came nice and piping hot. Their tomato sauce was on the sweeter side. We took about an hour to eat, get our check, and head out. And on the way out we spotted the party that was right ahead of us in the line. Yes, they were still waiting in the line. I kid you not.

We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a big line outside waiting to get in. Fortunately, we made the first wave of customers and didn't have to wait!\n\nFrom our upstairs table we were able to watch as our pizza was made.

The service is nonexistent and the restaurant experience was nothing special.

We got our pizza and to my surprise it felt like I was eating pizza from any of the pizza places in New York. It was ok.

So we were starving before we ever arrived \u0026 lost about 2 pounds each as our stomachs cannabalized themselves.\n\nWe ordered our pizza (pepperoni \u0026 sausage) when the oven was ready (the waiter would not take orders before it was).  We probably waited another 30mins for the pizza.  (Pizzas are sold whole only, btw; NO  individual slices are sold.)\n\nAt this point it's been, like, 2 hours since we were hungry.  By the time the pizza came, we were on the other side of STARVING.  STARVING!!!!  Oh my goodness!\n\nThe pizzas arrived upstairs piping h-o-double-t.  I was ready.  I was fully prepared to slide off of my chair from the deliciousness.  I was poised to faint from the sheer delectability that had been placed in front of me.

All that time on my poor aching feet after a walk through the city and across the bridge.  For this.  For Grimaldi's.\n\nThe cheese was chewy, not stringy, not melty.  The sauce was the best thing on the pizza.  Not too sweet, bursting with tomato flavor.  The pepperoni was oily - oil was flying everywhere.  The sausage is placed raw on the pizza and then \"cooked\" on the pizza in the oven (but some of my pieces were still raw).  Where the heck was the crispness to my mothereffing crust?!\n\nTwo hours of hunger.  Review after review after review of hype.  Step after step after step on the Brooklyn Bridge, many of the last hundred taken with surety that I was about to indulge in some of the best pizza around.\n\nAll for nothing.\n\nThanks, Grimaldi's.

However, I take periodic trips to New York just to eat and see shows and eat and take in the culture and eat. You get the drift. \n\nWell, the inevitable lines had daunted me before, so this time, my friend Carlos and I decided to go there at 10PM on a weeknight since they close at 11. If you can hold out that long, that's the key since the place is fairly empty at that hour on a Wednesday. In fact, we got the table next to the window, so we were quite happy and had moved from peckish to bulimic with our respective appetites. \n\nThere was no doubt we were going for the 18-inch Large for $14. We asked for mushrooms and black olives, as well as sausage on half of it. Each extra ingredient costs an additional $2. It already comes with melted slices of fresh mozzarella, tomato, basil, and their freshly made dough. Our order came out in no time, and the result was sheer heaven (see my photo). Dare I repeat the obvious...it's the best New York-style pizza I've had since my first slice of Original Ray's during the early Reagan years. \n\nThe secret is their coal-fired brick oven where in a flash, the pizza picks up a smokiness and the crust becomes light and crisp. We devoured it in twenty minutes...tops (see sad result in my photo). We even got a free dessert since the waiter forgot to get us our post-pizza cappuccinos. It was their Tartufo, a frozen ice cream concoction shaped like a chocolate-covered apple with a jammy center (see my photo). That was gone in about five minutes. \n\nService was terrifically friendly. The Italiano waiter told us the daily special was pizza. While I love a walk on the Brooklyn Bridge as much as anyone else, it becomes less appealing at night with the temperature dipping below thirty. We took the A-train to High Street where the stroll down to Old Fulton Street was a breeze.

It wouldn't have been a New York trip if we missed out on Grimaldi. After walking in the snow in 20 degree weather, I was ecstatic to see the Brooklynn Bridge. I was even more ecstatic when I saw Grimaldi right underneath (how convenient!) When we got there there was like 3 parties right at the door. It was very confusing because i had no idea whether I was suppose to go inside to put my name down or what. I then walked instead and the guy (I am assuming the manager) starts yelling for us to stand outside. I told him that we are here for two and just confirming on the process. He responded by saying \"yeah, i know two. now stand outside\" That kind of caught me off guard a bit but didn't stop me! Got in line and thank goodness was only in it for no longer than 10 minutes. We got seated by a window table in the far back. When we were waiting for our food, our area got extremely cold (maybe around 30 degrees) which kind of made it difficult to eat/wait. The couple next to us complained, but the manager said it was \"just them\" and moved them elsewhere. As we were waiting, the line outside grew and grew. If I was waiting more than an hour outside, and got seated instead (in the cold) i wouldn't have been happy. Anyhoo, we ordered a large pepperoni, sausage and jalapeno between two people and devoured every last bite. I asked Danny if this was his favorite, and he stated that he has had better but it was still really good and tasteful. I guess it really depends on what type of pizza mood you are in!
