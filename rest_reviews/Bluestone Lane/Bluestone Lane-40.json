A friend suggested Bluestone Lane.\nThe entrance was a little confusing because it is attached to a hotel, but the entrance is just next to the hotel entrance. Inside it is a little tight and the tabes are small. So, I would not go with a big group over 4 people. \nI got the avocado toast, coffee and a mimosa. The food was amazing and the avocado was absolutely fresh. The coffee came in funky bottles and then you poured it into coffee cups. The mimosas were very good and made with fresh orange juice. \nThe price was a little high, but nothing insane for NYC.", "author": "Josh R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-07", "description": "I had a latte to go and it took almost 10 minutes to make with no orders before me.

Came here about three times so far since I work in the area.  I'm still getting familiar with the are myself as a newcomer to Dumbo; however there are better local coffee shops compared to this one.  This is comparable to a \"local Starbucks\".  Larger than typical coffee/tea breakfast shops, but have that similar quaint ambiance in comparison to smaller local shops around the city have to offer.  I would recommend this spot to tourist and newcomers to downtown BK, but for those who work in the area or live, it's boring and the food/beverages are over priced for what it is worth. The best thing about this shop is the service.  It's impeccable.  Which shop serves coffee to you as you wait in your seat texting your supervisor your running late, \"train delays\". Lol, continuing with my rant, I gave this shop four stars because of the decor and service. Besides, there is better food, tea, and coffee in your house using your Keurig coffee maker lol.", "author": "Stevie R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-07", "description": "This place has a solid cold brew and you get in and out quickly. Prices are comparable to other mainstream coffee spots but the vibe is definitely better. The staff are all chill and friendly. All my experiences have been pleasant. One of the staff even remembered my name and I've only frequented this place a couple of times. Not a big deal for many but I appreciated the effort but it shows that they appreciate their customers.", "author": "Barney C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-22", "description": "The coffee is good.

Very close to the waters and a short walk to the Brooklyn Flea Market.\n\nThis Bluestone is spacious and has the cutest decor and furniture - gold metal chairs, marble-top tables, plants, mellow lighting.

I found myself a nice seat and just did work for hours. No one bothered me at all. I had a cute little beet latte which was so delish! Then I had a breakfast bowl when I got hungry. Everything was super fresh. An extra point for playing good music. I love how the Aussies do brunch. It's so good! Another thing was that the person at the register was so happy and positive. It makes a huge difference :)", "author": "Clarice Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-06", "description": "This place is near my office and it's where I go if I need an afternoon sweet treat or if I skip Starbucks on the way to work and still need some coffee. \n\nLike other Bluestone Lane locations, the staff here is mostly Australian and everybody is super friendly. The vibe is very Brooklyn chic. The back wall is covered in amazing flamingo wall paper and there are tons of brass accents everywhere. The space would be great for a coffee meeting (or first date if you're a coffee on the first date kinda person). \n\nI don't drink the coffee here much -- I actually prefer their lattes made with flavored powers. The matcha latte is thick and bitter in a good way, but the spicy, trendy turmeric-loaded Golden latte is my personal favorite. \n\nWhen it comes to food, don't expect a huge menu, but there are some solid lunch offerings. The avocado toast is hearty and feels like a treat (albeit a bit of an expensive one). I also love the Bircher Museli bowl, basically fancy overnight oats, but at $8 it's a bit of a splurge. Pro tip: They have Doughnut Plant doughnuts in their pastries case. Usually tres leches, blueberry, and carrot cake. \n\nIf you come here regularly, download their app. You can connect a card and pay by flashing a QR code at the register (heads up: they're cards only, no cash).
