Costed about $10-15, I don't really remember. Pretty much consisted of 5 pieces of chicken, white rice, a choice of a side which I choose house soup and a giant bread. There is another side, I think it was salad, but I can't remember.

But then I made a Turkish friend, and he has coerced me deep inside a wild world of lamb and spices.\n\nSince you make my world just a little bit brighter every day (yes, you), I'm going to share the most important piece of newfound knowledge with you (and because I know you're pressed for time, I'm going to leave out all the things that he's educated me on that have nothing to do with Deniz*):\n\nYou want the Yogurtlu Adana. \n\nI've seen it called other things at other Turkish joints, but essentially it's a lamb adana kebab topped with a garlicky yogurt sauce. The kebab has been cooked in butter and tomato sauce, and it's then laid over bread that soaks up all the delicious lamb juices and any stray sauce. This is what's good.**\n\nIf your lady friend is as skeptical of lamb as mine, hide hers in the Manti. Manti is sort of like gnocchi, but stuffed with seasoned lamb and onions, steamed, and served in more garlic yogurt (Turks like garlic yogurt). \n\nAre you really hungry? Add in a mixed appetizer plate. It's all sorts of mouthwatering dips, and they are the perfect reason to devour every bit of the thick, crisp, golden focaccia-esque bread served with every order. \n\nDeniz will deliver all this to your door quite promptly. Enjoy.\n_______________\n\n*Such as hookah, projecting video games on the side of a building, and a deep, burning hatred for Greeks. \n**But beware the green pepper in this dish. I tried a small bite, and my mouth went numb instantly. If you must prove your manhood, keep some yogurt handy.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-01", "description": "Came here for a rush meal. Its 5pm and I haven't eaten since my morning oats at 7.30am. So yes I am seriously hungry and on a food hunt.   I had some vague memory of eating at Deniz some years ago [before becoming a Yelpper] so I thought I would go for it.   Service was immediate, quick no messing about.   I ordered a Gyro plate which came in 5 minutes so maybe the chicken was already cut or they have some magic slicer that whips up food in record time. In any event the chicken was good, the salad great and the bread ok.  No complaints [I didnt bother with the rice] Tasty fast and unceremonious. OK I am going to start taking food photos for this Yelp thing from now.\n\nDeniz is ok food. Not brilliant ambiance, actually its quite dull though I had a window view onto Fulton so I could watch at my leisure the cops pick on a skate border and cyclist for who know what. Pathetic these people are truly sad. \n\nThree stars because 4 seems too much but I would eat here again if I was around and hungry. I wouldn't wake up and say, hmm I think I'll go to Deniz today.....", "author": "Sokari E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-18", "description": "The fried calf livers with red onions..OMG I'm addicted!!

Hehehe.

Americans serve really large portions boy!\n\nMustapha our server was good.

I was born in Bulgaria, and the eggplant salad is EXACTLY like my grandmother and my mom make at home. Just roasted eggplant with some garlic and red pepper, not too much vinegar like a lot of other places. \n\nI have a very sensitive stomach and I get heartburn or stomach pains from eating at restaurants where the food is too processed or greasy, but I have NEVER had a problem here (granted I order pretty conservatively getting a chicken kebab, a soup or another appetizer).

WOW!!!! The Yogurtlu was amazing. Lots of large chunks of lamb over some croutons, a flavorful tomato sauce, yogurt, a large spicy green pepper (which I placed to the side), and a roasted tomato. The croutons soaked up all of the sauces. Very flavorful dish with a big variety of textures.

We've taken many guests there to eat and they have all been very happy if not impressed by the food.\n\nThe restaurant itself, it's nicely decorated. It's not fine dining, but it's a great value for the price. Outdoor seating in the warmer months. Also, close to BAM. I think it is a family owned and operated restaurant, because they've had the same staff since I started coming. I always appreciate when it's apparent there is not a lot of staff turn-over. They all work as a team, and the waiters have consistently been very warm and attentive.\n\nThe menu is vast, and there are enough choices for every palate and dietary need (vegetarian, pescatarian, even some random Italian dishes). They also have a FULL bar and great desserts. The Baklava is some of the best I've had here in NYC. The dishes I usually get (once I like something I usually stick with it) are the lamb gyro (only weekends), actually any of the lamb dishes, the lentil soup is amazing, the cold appetizers and the rice pudding or baklava. \n\nThey also deliver, quite quickly most times.

And by favorite, I mean the only Turkish place I know in Brooklyn, but don't let that stop you from reading! My friend and I- I'll call her Scooby Doo- came here after a crazy indian color fest on a boat, after a fun long shower washing all the color off (alone of course), after friend-zoning a lovably annoying zombie who I never imagined would actually join us in this wonderful meal, and it was certainly everything I dreamed it would be- loud, obnoxious, banging on the table (now now...), Scooby singing sonnets about her star crossed lover after half a drink, me wondering why I couldn't think of any flamboyant love stories AND wondering why the Kadayif had mozzarella (?) cheese in it... Silly BV, Kunefeh is for cultured people! \n\nMy manti was yummy as always but I couldn't quite finish it- so I decided donate a piece to the center of the table... by accident... Hehe. Then Scooby Doo kept telling us to \"try these fries, they're amazing!\" Which made all of us suspicious, so I suspect pieces of her dish were secretly dismantled around her... The zombie's lamb dish seemed like a bad choice but he kept chewing and chewing with a big dumb smile and saying \"it was great\" just to impress me. He is never getting out of the friend zone. The other guy who pretended to be a wine connoisseur, so astute that he could SMELL that they brought him the wrong wine- was so secretive about his dish and what he ordered, that I never could understand his Deniz experience that day. He was eating like that smart kid in math class who always covers his exam so kids like me wouldn't copy him. Fine then, he probably ordered a whole plate of \"amazing fries\" and was too embarrassed to admit it. He then proceeded to \"help me take a picture\" of his yummy looking chocolate lava cake and instead started hacking into my phone and looking at all of my sexy pictures. Maybe this was NYC style BFF behavior. Or maybe he was just a douche. Who knows.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed watching my cognitive skills skills go downhill just by watching Scooby and co. getting drunkish, which is always entertaining. The waiters were all so friendly and good spirited to put up with our mildly obnoxious behavior, and one was even patient enough to explain each and every item (like 10) on the dessert tray when I decided to test his quick recall. He was even so helpful to alleviate the horrified look on my face when I saw cheese coming out of the kunefe and reminded my redneck self that it was Kadayif that I had been thinking of. \"All y'all look alike!\" I said ...to the dessert tray. (Hey! I'm brown, a globe jamun if you will.. I have immunity). \n\nThank you for reading.
