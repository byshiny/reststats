I wanted something healthy for dinner. Unfortunately, in this particular area of Brooklyn, there are no businesses that offer healthy food options. I decided to go to this Applebee's to get a salad to go. I ordered the salmon. It was $17 and change for one piece of grilled salmon over romaine lettuce. Waited 25 minutes for it. The staff is helpful, but the bathrooms are dirty, and the to-go waiting area was very dingy - stuff all over the tables. I will not be going again to this location, or any other Applebee's.", "author": "Count C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-30", "description": "Seated very quickly. Not sure why I was seated at such a large table being alone. Ordered food, came at a reasonable time. Triple burger was very tasty but not alot of bacon. The fries portion was quite small. A bit overpriced for a small meal. Also not sure while in mid bite of my burger my waitress asked me if I was ready to pay my check. The place was not crowded.

I sure hope the hostess with the bun has something to fall back on. Eventually her looks will fade and if she has to rely on that nasty attitude she won't last long. Food is already ehhhh.

It came with no mayo, one soggy piece of lettuce and one tomato slice. My friend ordered a chicken tenders basket and it came in a plate (Not a basket) with 4 chicken tenders (not 5 as displayed on website menu) and a handful of fries. It looked like a children's plater and he's a grown ass man.  After getting our other friends order wrong about 3 times she spoke to a manger and didn't have to pay for her meal, which she didn't want anyway.

They've got brain-dead employees so tired they act like they're ready to go home before you've even placed your order and they take SO much time not only taking your order, but actually serving your food. You're better off going to a REAL restaurant with actual class, not this wanna-be fast food restaurant with dirty floors that takes advantage of their customers due to being in a good location. They're not staying in business based on skills. They're simply lucky to be in a busy location where people eventually get hungry and will eat anything, including glue.\n\nThe reality of Applebee's is gross looking, sloppy food, really small portions, offensive prices akin to highway robbery, bland, unsatisfying flavors, overly chewy consistencies, al dente pasta, and absolutely unappetizing presentations all around. I thought a dog threw up in my food, but apparently that's what they serve you on a regular basis. There are very few foods on the menu that are actually portioned large enough to call a \"meal.\" The photographs on the menu make everything look much larger, but what you get is half the size. They didn't give me enough food to feed a cat, let alone feed me enough for the horrendous prices. Their overly seasoned, high sodium food will give you a heart attack or stroke before you make it to the age of 35, yet the flavors are undetectable and drowned out in the slop of sauces they mix together. This place is not worth the arm and a leg which they charge you, nor your first of kin unless you actually believe this place is a charity center for the blatantly rude, inconsiderate, and pathetic imbeciles that they are.\n\nI ended up with diarrhea the night I went here and then hemorrhoids later on for sitting on the toilet for so many hours. Shouldn't I send them my doctor's bill?!! Eating at places like this is how people in NYC become homeless. I can't afford these dramatic bills.\n\nHonestly, I'd rather just order in from my nearest Chinese food restaurant any day than do any favors for these rude pricks! I don't need to lose money on a landfill of a place like this ever again nor did I need the low-class rudeness I endured from the bitch waitress who flirted with my boyfriend but who gave me the snob treatment upon ordering. Staff like yours makes people anti-social when social skills are completely essential for survival in NYC. Get some manners, Applebee's!

I'll say it again. POOR. Sat at the bar the read the menu. Was not busy with one person serving. I was patient and waited for the bar tender to take my order. Finally she arrived and I didn't even get the hello out when the server was distracted with a dish to give to another person waiting for their food. Still sitting there patient and waiting. After the server came to my end of the bar four times and walked away I decided to go to juniors. I won't be ignored there. That's for sure! So I do not tco end anyone to got to Applebee's period.

Aldrea a server was the saving grace of said staff as she came and checked up on us after some people brought in a 7 year old??

I'm in shock of the people even giving it three stars...this place is GHETTO TRASH!  My friends and I came here after shopping and waited an abnormally long time for our food. All we can hear is laughter from the kitchen, a bunch of dishes \u0026 whatever else dropping and staff screaming ayyyyeee ayyye!! wth? Were they dancing in the kitchen? I never heard such mess in my life going to any restaurant!  When the food finally does come it is nasty...I only liked the salad and shrimp skewer , the raspberry tea was pure sugar and mind you I love sweet tea and my boneless chicken was so hard it felt like my teeth were breaking (I barely touched it).  My friends fries were hard as rocks.  I made the complaint to the waitress and the manager took a thousand years to come only thing I can say she was polite..and she took the \"rock boneless chicken\" off the bill. The childish staff however got real sarcastic and start playing with the knobs to the music and start blasting it real loud...one of my friends said it was too loud (nobody could hear themselves talk) they did that so it can blear out their ghetto behavior in the kitchen.  He lowered it, then I saw the waitress that waited on us whisper to another female co worker about us, the female responded oh well who cares about the music being loud, they complain about us too! All I can think is wow how in the world these people get jobs with such childish behavior.  The only one that seem half decent beside the manager gave us an inside scoop that one of the staff was in a physical altercation with a customer hours before we arrived there.. with that behavior I can see why a customer would jump at them...me I don't have the time so instead of whipping anybody's behind in that beyond hood applebee's I just didn't tip them and would never go there again.
