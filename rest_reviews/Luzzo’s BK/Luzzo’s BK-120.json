He jokes with customers about pronouncing the Italian dishes but takes everything too far. He came by and asked my girlfriend and her friends several times how to spell the dishes that they ordered and laughed and made fun of them in Spanish. He even asked a co-worker to come by and listen.

We had two pies, one with mushrooms and the other with fried eggplant. Both were great, thin crust that held up in the middle, light char on the edges, and a nice chew to the dough. We also got two salads, that were fine but nothing too exciting. I'd stick with their pies.\n\nThey had an interesting layout. The space is divided into two, separated by a bar. The front of the restaurant has tall standing/stool tables, while the back is a sit down restaurant. I guess you could go for a drink and quick snack if you prefer to stand at the front.\n\nService was great, attentive, and food came out quickly. All-round really exciting addition to the neighborhood!", "author": "Viv C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-05", "description": "Great pizza,  great place,  great people.  Had the pleasure to eat here a few weeks ago.  The food was good,  the drinks were good.  The brick oven pizza is on of the best I have ever had.  I am from Brooklyn born and raised.

Luzzos is right at the top. There is Lucali, south brooklyn, table 87 just to name a few but Luzzos gives you a top quality pie and the waitstaff is by far and away the best. \n\nClassic Margarita is my fav with the crust perfectly burnt. Perfectly paired with an ice cold beer. My second fav pie(yes I have two ) is the Diavolo pie nice and spicy", "author": "Margo S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-31", "description": "The best Pizza In NYC!!!!\nI'm Italian and I can confirm that It doesn't get better than this.\nThin crust, super fresh sauce and Mozzarella, great topping selection.\nWine list has a lot of options of different Italian grape variates. \nExtensive cocktail list, even though we haven't tried any of the drinks, they seem solid.\nAmazing  Zeppole stuffed with Nutella and coated with sugar. Top notch Illy espresso and Capuccino. Overall good friendly service.

I say delicious condition because often times this type of pizza does not travel well and can be a cold mess by the time it arrives. \n\nI go for the plain old margherita pizza every time, and it get me in my happy stomach spot every time. I will indeed branch out soon to some different pies, but not yet. \n\nThe salads aren't bad, but they are a bit pricey. I'm anxious to try the pasta!", "author": "Jamie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-09", "description": "Sweet and burnt pizza!

Perfect for a nice day like yesterday and today. The owner is a friendly guy and his staff is laid back, yet knows their business.
