The burgers are delicious, the drinks \u0026 beer are great, and the staff is incredibly friendly - what more could you ask for in a burger place?\n\nIf you're not in the mood for fries, I suggest sharing a plate of the nachos with whoever you're dining, they are fantastic.  Also, if you deny yourself the 282 sauce you are a crazy person.\n\nI know a lot of the reviews talk about the size of the burgers here, and I swear the sizes of the burgers are getting bigger each time I go.\n\nThis is an awesome place to sit at the bar, grab a beer, and have a burger.  The staff and owner are really nice, and it doesn't hurt that the burgers are perfectly cooked.", "author": "Kathleen C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-07", "description": "Came here more than once.

The burgers are delicious and made with meat from my favorite butchers. The grilled cheese is perfect as is the BLT. Greek Salad is large and fresh. Full bar to keep me liquored up! And any place that serves good onion rings is a winner with me. If they would just add a side salad to the menu it would be perfect.", "author": "Tammy J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-25", "description": "Came here on a Saturday afternoon and sat in their patio area, no wait at all.

The waiter suggested the new Hatch burger. It has a little spicy kick to it. It was a great suggestion. The Greek fries were very tasty.

Their burger is well seared, always juicy.  The bun is perfectly buttered and warmed.  The poblano peppers are a great touch.  They have a great beer selection of beers.  Service is good and quick.  I travel to find a good burger.

I tried the 50/50 burger, which was quite simply the best burger i've ever had.  We shared the greek fries, and i'd recommend sharing since one order can easily fill 2 people.  My group also tried the breakfast burger, Billy Burger, and Turkey burger, and both parties who had the beef burgers said they were one of if not THE best burger they've ever had.  The turkey burger eater said it was good, but not \"the best\".  Needless to say the burgers were good enough that we walked back for lunch the next day.  HIGHLY Recommend this place.  They also have some great beers on tap, if you into that sort of thing :)", "author": "Michael G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-06", "description": "Come eat here!\n\nI love their burgers.

Bun could use some work but the burger makes it well worth the visit. I've had everything on their menu minus the grilled cheese. Everything is really tasty. Great BLT. Great hotdogs (a bit messy though). Good selection of beer. Great cocktails. Sometimes they can be a little grumpy but most good burger places I've been to are kind of like that (the grumpiness gets the burgers out quicker and better I think).", "author": "Adam F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-10", "description": "Billy Burger was 8 bites of drippy, cheesy,onion bliss.

The problem was I ordered it, not her, so I got to eat half of it.  Her turkey burger was delicious, but how can you compete with a burger that has bacon and a fried egg on it?  The decor was minimal and classy, and the service was friendly and helpful.

Received water and that's it,the waiter took our order and never received our food.

I went again, and again was underwhelmed.  Burger was juicy, but wasn't anything special.  Also had the greek fries, again they were flavorless.

The FAVORITE BURGER of the evening is the \"Breakfast Burger\".\n\nThe ambience is not too shabby, but for some, it can be considered a wee bit dark.  Personally, I don't mind it too much.\n\nIf anything, the only \"negative\" is the open kitchen aspect - By the time you leave the restaurant, you \u0026 your clothing items smell like burgers...:-|", "author": "Ada C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-10", "description": "Really good burgers.

I almost always get the billy burger and it never disappoints. Their special two8two sauce is amazing-I don't know what they put in it but we always ask for extra for our fries. The service is great here as well-very quick and all of the servers are really friendly. They also have a fun drink menu which is especially great during the summer when you can sit outside on their terrace. My only complaint about two8two is the way that your clothes smell after eating here. I don't know if we always get placed too close to the kitchen or what it is but we always come out smelling like the food. This will always be one of our fave spots though and we will continue to frequent it.", "author": "Molly H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-05", "description": "Solid burger, good ambiance, great service.
