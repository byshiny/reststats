Jeff M. and I had gone on a half-hearted appointment to look at some apartments on the edge of Fort Greene, and decided to make the trip worthwhile by sticking around for dinner. We stumbled on Bacchus and are glad we did. Everyone who works there seems to be actually French, the back garden is lovely and the weather was great, and the moule frites with sancerre was a perfect dinner. I'd love to return.", "author": "Sarah C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-29", "description": "Wife and I had dinner here last week. The staff were friendly and attentive on our arrival. The pork belly appetizer and braised beef cheeks were cooked well and were delicious. I had a glass of the house Cote d Rhone which was fantastic. The service attention dropped off a little towards the end of the meal, which would be OK in the lovely backyard if my wine glass were not empty. The creme brulee was quite good.\n\nThe backyard atmosphere is quiet and very nice.

It was wonderful! The outdoor space was really pretty. We brought the table runners and the flowers and staff set up everything perfectly. Meryl was very considerate of our budget. All the answers to our questions, for the most part, were \"no problem.\" My husband wanted to make our wedding cake and they had no problem with that. At the beginning of the party we were extra hot and staff quickly pulled the covering over the sitting area to give us much needed relief from the sun. I'm so happy to have had my summer wedding here!", "author": "Josey B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-28", "description": "Great french cuisine :)\n\nI (unfortunately) didn't come with much of an appetite so I got the french onion soup, which was so rich and amazing. I also got the appetizer serving of goat cheese gnocchi, with very well seasoned zucchini and squash with a sage butter that was fragrant but not overpowering AND the vegetables were tender but had a slight bite (how I like them). Only downside is though it was an appetizer size, there were only 6 1.5 in. gnocchi. There were definitely more veggies than gnocchi...but besides that, so good.\n\nMy room mate got unlimited mussels (Tuesday night special) which were to die for. You have an option of 5(?) or so sauces...so you will definitely get what you want. Also the fries it comes with (with some skin on and definitely look hand cut) are pretty delicious...I took bites from both. She also got a salad with fried artichokes, which we thought was dressed too heavily. So that was the only downer. \n\nThere is a bunch of wine and even decently priced bottles for some thrifty but love a good bottle epicureans out there. I'd go back :)\n\nWe had our reservation at 8pm on a Tuesday night, pretty light crowd...however the lights dim real romantically around 9:30 or so...so if you want to set the \"mood\" make later dinner reservations for that special someone or a girl's night to drink wine and eat good food//relax!", "author": "Gabby S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-31", "description": "Our wedding was in June 2017 at Bacchus. We had 105 people, and everyone was able to have a seat at the ceremony. The staff was flexible with last minute cancellations and seating changes, and we appreciated that very much. We were looking for something intimate with great food and that would allow for good conversation. It was exactly what we wanted. The decor in the backyard was charming in itself, so we did not have to bring much. Meryl and Alvaro were very responsive to our questions in the weeks that led up to our wedding. We met with them several times a couple weeks out from the wedding to go over the menu and logistics, and they met with our DJ as well. The staff were attentive to our needs and requests. They put us at ease. My husband and I created our itinerary, and it was fine with them. As the night went on, Meryl and Alvaro were able to transition things flawlessly from one part of the night to the other. My family told me later that they staff were very friendly to them. The food was a hit and everyone raved about it. My only helpful critique would be that although we bought out the restaurant and backyard, we would have liked to have the adjoining bar room to ourselves, as soon as we arrived.", "author": "Jackie W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-10", "description": "Seriously, I can't even express how grateful we were to have found Bacchus for our wedding reception this past May. From the moment we met Meryl, we knew that it would be a stress-free and amazing event. Besides the fact that the decor and ambiance are to die for (i mean, you literally feel like you're sitting in a bistro in Provence, France), their food is AMAZING, their wine selection is superb, each and every one of their staff members are beyond friendly (with their beautiful french accents and all) and the total cost is very budget-friendly compared to most NY wedding venues. My hubby and I knew that we wanted a very unique, relaxed and non-traditional feel for our wedding. Bacchus achieved that and so much more. Meryl \u0026 staff were super accommodating and attentive to our guests' needs. I would definitely recommend Bacchus for a wedding, rehearsal dinner, special event or even a night on the town. Oh!! And how could I forget the garden area!! Absolutely beautiful!! This is definitely a hidden gem of Brooklyn :)", "author": "Nicole J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-09-10", "description": "This place definitely is pretty. The outdoor back area is a great place to eat. I came here for brunch last weekend with my friends and was so disappointed. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded amazing. It took me forever to finally decide. I finally went with the chicken sandwich with lettuce, tomato, aioli, and avocado. It was served with fries and a mixed salad. The fries and salad were good. My real complaint was with that sandwich. I bet when you read the ingredients above you thought, \"oh, that sounds yummy!\" Yea, well, so did I! It was one of the most disappointing sandwiches I have ever had. If someone lists a chicken sandwich on their menu one would assume it's a grilled chicken sandwich unless otherwise noted. What they served me was basically a chicken burger. I HATE chicken burgers with a passion! I really tried to eat it but it was pretty gross. Note to the owners: next time specific that it's going to be a ground chicken on the sandwich!\n\nAlso, when the waiter brought me my sandwich it did not have the avocado on it. He came back about 5 minutes later with sliced avocados on a plate. Apparently, this was a build your own sandwich type of thing. The bill only came out to $17 each, which isn't so bad. But since I took about two bites of my sandwich, I spent $17 for some fries and a small salad.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-08", "description": "What a great Atlantic Ave establishment. Wide wine selection and a rather reasonable prix fix menu. Had the pleasure of having their escargot that was seasoned just right, steak that I wanted to both rapidly devour and savor so slowly piece by piece at the same time, and some molten lava cake so potent in flavor.

I know this because I am down with the people -\n\nLocated on Atlantic Avenue, location is decent with adequate street parking available (at least on weeknight).  And neighborhood looks safe enough where I won't get mugged or shot walking down the street.\n\nMet with a couple of friends for dinner here.  The wine list is adequate (no Whiskey, perhaps cause they're French) - we drank 3 bottles of the Malbec which was very good wine.  \n\nOverall, food was good and fresh.  The mussels appetizer was probably the best dish if the night, hands down.  The hangar steak skewers were also well seasoned and the meat tore off the skewer nicely.  We got the pork belly combination platter as well - a little too fatty for my taste or for anyone looking to become a lean machine- so I actually ordered the salad with the pears (forgot name) - good salad, a little oily on the lips cause of the dressing \n\nI decided to go with the hamburger for dinner - well seasoned and cooked.  The bad: the bun was soggy and the burger as a whole was way too wide to fit in my mouth, so I was gnawing on it like a beaver building a dam.  Fries are mediocre at best, and I know French fries (they were not epic by any means)\n\nDecaf for coffee along with molten cake and another desert with fruit in it (forgot name).  They were all good but nothing earth shattering that you also couldn't find elsewhere.\n\nFood overall was good - deserves 4 out of 5 stars.  Problem is service - wait staff polite, but they forget orders (I had to order my diet coke twice), and the ticket time for food to come out I would say is at least 1/2 hr, a little on the long side for sure (I don't think Robert Irvine would approve). \n\nBut I guess I'm pretty cool for coming here along with the other cool local hipsters- check it out if you want to be cool", "author": "Albert Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-15", "description": "I gave this place 5 stars because of their service from the host and waitstaff.

The server was an amazingly sweet woman who was helpful in her recommendations. I had the escargot to start and a salmon entree, finishing with the ile flotante (floating island dessert). If you've never had it, it's seriously one of the most rich, expensive tasting desserts - soft poached meringue over custard. The meringue is has a caramelized brulee top and served with fruit - I still think about this dessert sometimes!\n\nWe finished the dessert and topped it off with coffee and tea.
