I love how they are tucked away on a residential block in the heart of Boerum Hill. I've been here several times but recently came with my aunt and uncle on a cold windy night. Rucola really hit the spot. The ambiance is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The wait can get long and since they don't take reservations, come on the early side! \n\nFood- we started off with some of the vegetable antipasti, specifically the marinated olives, balsamic roasted beets and eggplant caponata. It all went superbly with the great bread they bring to the table. I don't even like eggplant, but they somehow made it so tasty that even I enjoyed it. For the main I got the sardi- a housemade pasta with butternut squash puree, kale and mushrooms. It was excellent. \n\nThey have tables for small parties and then they have one long table in the center of the restaurant, good for big groups or just family style seating with strangers. Can't wait to go back again soon.", "author": "Sara K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-12", "description": "Had a nice brunch here while visiting the neighborhood.  Bit of a wait and quite small and cramped but the food was excellent.  I had the smoked salmon sandwich.

Here's a tip management: If you are going to offer brunch until 4pm, you may want to plan accordingly so you don't run out of half of your menu (no smoked salmon, no chocolate croissants, etc.).  Although the food was reasonably good for what was available, the lack of options was a disappointment.   Suffice it to say, we won't be back.", "author": "Ben S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-20", "description": "This place is cute and intimate; great for a date night.

We both ordered the roasted chicken which was excellent, very moist and the presentation was lovely. I also ordered the polenta and was very pleased. However, there was a large party that was quite boisterous and loud. We couldn't communicate over the noise, hear the waitress review the evening specials and it quite ruined the entire dining experience. We ordered our coffee and desert to -go, in order to escape. I won't be returning.  The restaurant management should require large parties to reserve the entire restaurant. \nI won't be returning anytime soon.", "author": "Martha S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-16", "description": "The food here is so yummy, but the service is not exactly welcoming.

The food is as excellent as the service.", "author": "Terrence M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "I've had this place bookmarked for ages so am glad I finally got to try it last night for dinner. Knowing they didn't take reservations, we put our name down on the list and went to the Brooklyn Inn for a drink while we waited for our table. The 45 minute wait was expected for a Friday night at around 8. They called us back about 40 minutes later but when we got there, we were told that our table wasn't actually ready yet because the people were just finishing up dessert. Maybe they didn't expect us to actually come back so promptly, but it was a little annoying. We got seated about 10 minutes later.\n\nThe restaurant is so charming and cozy with it's tall open windows with indoor planter boxes. The lighting above is made out of what looked like milk bottles that covered the dim yellow light bulbs. I love the dark old weathered fixtures that give the place such character. Our waitress was friendly and great at describing the popular dishes. \n\nWe started with a bottle of the Montepulciano and a bunch of appetizers: the pickled fennel, the Sapore del Piave cheese, eggplant caponata, roasted carrots and grilled octopus. The big chunks of fennel were lightly pickled, crunchy and refreshing. The waitress described the Sapore del Piave cheese as similar to a cheddar and the best cheese she's ever had in the world - big call, lady. With that statement, I had to try it. When it came out, I thought it was more nutty and hard than a cheddar and while it was delicious, I don't think I'd say it was the best in the world. But could I say that about any cheese? There's just too much good cheese out there. I was a little disappointed to see only three thin slices of the cheese, but I did really like the homemade pear jam it came with.The roasted carrots were served on a bed of black lentils topped with goat cheese. Delicious! Carrots can be one of the most boring things to eat in my opinion but these were great. The grilled octopus was served on some pinto beans and was pretty good, and the eggplant was tasty but not that memorable. \n\nFor the main, I ordered the roasted chicken. Divine. The skin was crispy and light and the chicken was so juicy and tender. It was served on top of a creamy celery root pur\u00e9e with some saut\u00e9ed spinach. I certainly ate the entire dish with minimal sharing.\n\nWhen it was time for dessert, our famously upselling waitress recommended the Four \u0026 Twenty Blackbirds fig crumble. I had no idea what Four \u0026 Twenty Blackbirds was but apparently it's one of the best pie places in Brooklyn, and as a Californian, I love figs so of course I ordered it. It was magical. It tasted like Christmas, and the fresh whipped cream on the side was perfection.\n\nGreat spot! I'll be back.", "author": "Tiffany F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-06", "description": "This place is a magical, romantical retreat in a sea of hipstery, overrated, overpriced Cobble Hill restaurants.

And thanks to the superbowl, easy for our group of 4 to snag a table. \n\nWe shared an antipasti plate-which I'd highly recommend. \n\nWhile others ordered mostly pasta items, I went for a combination of veggies and the soup.\n\nThe soup was good, and the vegetables were amazing. Perhaps one of the best brussels sprout dishes I've tried. I also snagged a few bites of the husband's roasted carrots and thought they were equally delicious. I'm not usually a cooked carrot person, but these were so nicely roasted \u0026 seasoned that they tasted more like sweet potatoes than carrot. Yum. \n\nChocolate pudding to end, and we left happy. \n\nWe'll be back soon!", "author": "Saskia S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-17", "description": "Awesome place, I can't wait to go back! We came in at 10:30 on Saturday night and were told that there would be a 30 minute wait. They offered to take our number and call us but we opted to hang out at the bar. The bartender did not seem to notice us at all while we waited (we were standing, as there were no seats left) and I mentioned this to the owner. He apologized profusely and really made us feel like VIPsafter that.\n\nThe food was amazing, we had the brussel sprouts, olives, and a special (baked parsnips) which were so good.

It was a Friday night...they told husband and I it was a 45 minute wait...no big deal, it's a gorgeous night we will hang outside. After 50 minutes and an estimated 15 parties sat before us we asked how much longer. The rude young man taking names told me that it would be another 45 minutes and it would of been smarter to call ahead. Not only was I caught off guard that the wait is now double our original time, he scolded me! It was now 10pm, we are starving and its too late wait another 45 minutes somewhere else or anywhere else for that matter! We left.

We had the arugula salad, crudo, duck liver mousse with blackberries, an amazing pasta dish called garganelli, and crispy polenta.

A buddy and I arrived for a quick breakfast and were pleased with the delicious coffee (Stumptown maybe?)  I had the broccoli rabe and cheese scramble and was satisfied, buts not won over by the slightly runny eggs, although I liked the combination of eggs and broccoli rabe.  My dining companion had the egg and kale sandwich which I admit, looks better to me than what I was having.  All in all a nice experience with good service.
