The service was super and both waiters took such nice care of us. The food was DELICIOUS. Really great dinner prix fix menu. Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala and delicious naan. A lot of Brooklyn Indian restaurants aren't very good, but Curry Heights knocked it out of the park.", "author": "Pepper P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-14", "description": "I order the chicken tikka Marsala from meal pal.. the food was tasty and excellent! good portions very happy with the choice! I was initially skeptical a bit due to yelp reviews but after try it out.. so happy to find good Indian food. only bit problem is when i went there.. the meal wasnt ready yet.. i had to wait to pick it up, luckily it was already pre-made.. but it be nice to just come and pick up", "author": "Celena S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-12", "description": "Curry Heights is one of my favorite place in the area. It's near my office and I take like 3/5 of my lunches there. I took number of my office colleagues also there for lunch - though they were not used to Indian food but they really liked the food and place. I love thandori chicken - make sure they warm it up well - and all the vegetables as cabbage, okra and spinach with white rice.", "author": "Ahmed S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-24", "description": "Great tasting food.

I have to children that are very picky eaters, and i was afraid i wouldn't be able to find anything on the menu for them to eat. well to my surprise they enjoyed every bit of their dishes. and i must say besides the food being great the restaurant its self was very pretty. the portions of food and the manner that it was served was a big plus. definitely coming back!! \n\nP.S...

The problem with Indian food in America is not that it's spicy, but that it's watered-down, sweetened-up and spiced-down to please palates that enjoy sugary salty pap like American-style pad thai and Dunkin' Donuts croissandwiches.\n\nIf you've tasted Indian food in London or India then you'll be disappointed - but, in this neighborhood, Curry Heights is about as good as you'll get. The meats were tender. Everything was tasty, though nothing was spicy. (Other users who've written that everything is too spicy just have no idea what Indian food is - how can basmati rice be \"inedible because it was so spicy\", as one reviewer wrote? It's not even flavored!) If you want Indian and you're in the neighborhood, this is a comfortable bet. I'll be back.", "author": "Josh Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-05", "description": "I love Curry Heights and I dont care who knows it!  Being a white girl from California, I don't purport to be an expert in Indian food and I cannot weigh in on the authenticity of the cuisine at Curry Heights, but there is literally nothing to hate about this place.  Their meal deal, at $14.95, is my go-to each and every time.  The food is hot, fresh, flavorful and just all around wonderful.  I also think the paneer at Curry Heights is the best I have had anywhere in the vicinity, they just cook it perfect every time.  Their naan is perfection.  When I order out, the delivery is quick, and when I eat in, the servers are incredibly nice and attentive, so much so that I feel as if I do not deserve such quality service for the very reasonably prices.\n\nIf you want pretentious Indian food with expensive alcohol and small portions, I recommend Dosa Royale on Court (no hate, I go there too and its wonderful-- just a different vibe).  Otherwise, Curry Heights its where its at.

The food is okay, but not exceptional.\n\nTonight, I ordered through Grubhub at around 8 and got a confirmation at 8:15 with estimated delivery at 8:45 to 8:55. At 9:15, they told me that their delivery guy was on the way. This was a lie. At 9:50, they told me that their computer was down and they hadn't seen my order. As of 10, it's been two hours and I still don't have my food.\n\nI don't mind that their computer malfunctioned and my food is late. That kind of problem is unavoidable. But it's absolutely unacceptable that they lied about my status when I placed my first call.\n\nThey get 2 stars instead of 1 star because I've had okay dine-in experiences before.", "author": "Benjamin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-26", "description": "The peshwari naan, coconut samosas and chicken korma are out of this world!

The mulligatawny soup is very tomatoe-y but they warned me verbally about that and I enjoyed it, although I like it with a bit more lentil ultimately. The vindaloo is really spicy, which is exactly what I wanted. The rice had good flavor and a bit of oil in it and cumin. The sauces with the papadam were the most memorable thing especially the coriander (nice and tangy and dairy free) and the tamarind sauce, nice and fruity, not sugary and thin.", "author": "Jesse H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-20", "description": "I used to live in the East Village, and Curry Row always baffled me. I never understood why so many Indian restaurants would set up all in one spot and directly compete for the same business. \n\nBut regardless of whether or not it makes sense to me, I loved it. Perhaps because it's automatic quality control. Since there were so many options so close together, the restaurants had to serve stellar food, or risk going out of business. And as a result, I was never subjected to the blandness of my meal at Curry Heights (the only Indian option nearby). \n\nThe tikka masala was watery and thin; it tasted like sweet tomato soup, with chunks of chicken in it. The chicken pakora was entirely too bready, and although the lamb bhuna was edible, it was unremarkable in every way. \n\nAlthough you do get a sizable meal for your money, I think I've eaten too much excellent Indian to justify a return visit.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-10", "description": "I usually get the chicken tikka with a side of masala sauce, with veggie samosas.

Also, the portions are generous.  The problem is that the food is nothing special, so that tempers my excitement about the prices and portions. \n\nThe saag paneer was probably the best thing I had--it was tasty and savory, but the chicken tikka masala was lacking.  The sauce was mysteriously smooth and thin, whereas better iterations are a bit thicker and chunkier, with a more assertive flavor.  There was plenty of naan to soak everything up and I left really full and pretty satisfied.
