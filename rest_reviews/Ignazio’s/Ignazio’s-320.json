I went there on saturday 7/26 and after waiting for over 50 min for 2 pies of pizza, the overhyped expectations came to a screeching halt!!! The pizza was \"ok\", nothing to rave about. I ordered two pies , one pepperoni and one veggie with a couple of drinks. My bill with tax was 85.00. This was for two freakin pies!! I have had Alot better Brooklyn pizza for alot cheaper... Dont let the hype of this place bamboozle you. Definitely no wheres near close to a true representation of Brooklyn style pizza....

We were planning on going to the famous Grimaldi's pizza, but the line was insanely long... so we walked around the corner and found ourselves here.\n\nIgnazio's is a nice, clean sit down pizza restaurant... a little different than most pizza spots.

No one came to take our order. No one brought us water. No one who appeared to be a staff member would make eye contact with us. The customers at nearby tables finished their meals, left and new customers were seated. At about the 20 minute mark, a waitress came and started to take the order of the girls who were just seated behind us. I turned around to ask her to take our order, and she disappeared through the maze of mostly-empty tables. \n\nI'm pretty patient about waiting -- when there's a reason. If someone's new on a job but they're trying, it's cool. I've been there. If a place is busy and I can tell they're in the weeds, we'll entertain ourselves until they're caught up. If wait staff ignore me because they clearly just don't feel like working? I have no patience for that. And it's doubly insulting to witness uneven service. Maybe the girls at the table behind ours can tell you if Ignorio's pizza is better or worse than the pies at Grimaldi's. We didn't stick around to find out. \n\n. \n\nOn top of the garbage service here, they engage in illegal tipping practices. Their menus state that they levy diners with a charge of 20% for parties of 4 or more. NYC law says that restaurants can add a gratuity to the bill ONLY for parties of 8 or more persons, and only up to 15%. [ http://www.newyorkology.com/archives/2009/02/nyc_prohibits_b.php ] If Ignazio's staff finds their pockets empty without auto-gratuity strongarming, I suspect that the problem is not with the customers' generosity or knowledge of US tipping protocols.", "author": "Emma S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "description": "Sicilian was meh.

I decided to give Ignazio's one more shot since my first experience was horrible.    My three friends and I sat down only to be told, by an extremely rude waitress, that they were out of EIGHT pizza toppings (out of 12)..  seriously, how does a pizza restaurant run out of onions?    The grocery store is that far away to buy more??   I said that this was the case the last time I visited Ignazio's and the waitress, full of pointless excuses, basically said this is what happens in restaurants in New York City.   Really?  \n\nThe pizza is average at best and extremely overpriced.  Worse is that they automatically charge a 15% service tip whether you have good service or not.

They know what they are doing.\n\nA friend of mine and I took our two kids each to the pier to play, walk and enjoy the views  - of course we all got hungry and the food consensus for Brooklyn kids is always about PIZZA. Our blood sugar levels were hitting that off kilter zone so we stopped in Ignazio's without realizing what a tourist trap it is. \n\nThe menu was giving us a headache and so we just ordered a pie for the kids that was $23 plus $3 extra for pepperoni.  Each kid had 2 slices of pie and a drink (ginger ale and a sprite like drink) and me and my friend had a non-alcoholic beverage. The BILL CAME TO $58 for that. They did include the 20%  tip which the waitress was more on the 15% scale (if that) we had to ask her for the bill after finishing for quite awhile and she was not helpful at all about the obscure details of the menu. \n\nAlso let me say this is a cash only restaurant - which seems strange for a place that doesn't even serve slices. They even provide a cash machine in the restaurant lol.\n\nThe pizza - was super greasy you could smell the grease coming off the pie and the bottom was super super soggy because of the heavy grease. The actual pepperoni slices on the pie were good though.\n\nAfter we paid the almost $60 (for pizza and soda) for a lunch bill - I went straight to the taco truck and had a couple tacos for less than $6 - they were HEAVEN and next time I am at the pier with or without my kids I know where I am going and it won't be Ignacios...\n\"fool me once shame on you\"", "author": "eva a."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-28", "description": "SOLID!

It wasn't the famous Grimaldis because their line was absolutely ridiculous, but ya know what, I would easily tell my friends to eat here!  It was delicious pizza.

Ignazios knows this and only makes pies.  They use excellent ingrediants and everything is always fresh.

HORRIBLE service. I tried this place twice, because my kids were desperate for pizza and too young/antsy to wait in a long line. First time the food was TERRIBLE. The pizza was bland and rubbery.

The second time I tried (similar deal - cranky, hungry kids insisting I give it one more shot) ... we waited 20 minutes for a table without being acknowledged and eventually gave up.

I can live without pizza.  We were actually planning on having lunch at the River Cafe except that they weren't open til 5 on a Saturday.  So anyway, we chanced upon this place.  Yes, I have heard of Grimaldi but I have better things to do in New York than wait in line for pizza - and I don't even like pizza - so we decided Ignazio's is it!  We were seated right away but it did take a while for a waitress to come over only to tell us that another waitress is coming to serve us shortly.  WTH, right?  Why couldn't you just take our order?  But anyhow, our waitress came looking like Tinker Bell with her sparkly eye make-up so we were pleasantly amused and we forgot that we were waiting awhile to be served.\n\nWe had The Pizza with Pepperoni \u0026 for appetizers, the 3 of us shared the Sicilian Tuna.  The tuna was wow delicious - I never had tuna this good before.  Super yummy!  The pizza was wonderful too - brilliant crust and full of flavor from fresh ingredients.  The best.\n\nI wanted to give them 5 stars but I didn't like the wait plus the fact that they're CASH only.  Otherwise, raving reviews for the food!

The sky opened up and it started to piss down HEAVILY. The Spiderman shoot down the street was on break and David Sedaris was only up to fan#700 @ the Powerhouse arena.

Decent crowd not too many tourists. No wait and I was able to use a wall socket to charge my phone. Meatballs were definitely the go for the appetiser and the pizza was pretty good.
