The food is very delicious here and it seems like the locals knows what they want to order as soon as they sit down. It's definitely a great place to visit during the winter when it's cold out - the lamb soup tastes home-made and the entrees/appetizers are savory  The lamb haneeth is very flavorful and they serve it over rice and some kind of curry/veggie mix. I almost always order babaganoush (which is equally delicious as the lamb) to complement the entree. I give this place a 5/5 because they've been consistent in food quality, customer service, and price (easy on the wallet).", "author": "Marc L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-15", "description": "Great, authentic place in the Arab enclave of Atlantic Avenue.

We had the lamb haneeth and the chicken haneeth. The meat just falls off the bone. EVERY TIME. I don't know how they perfected cooking meat perfectly EVERYTIME. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. The food is just amazing. With the entree, they give you a complimentary salad, lamb soup (MUST TRY and add the lemon) AND bread. Like where can you get great food and at this deal? Also try the tea. It's sweet and just try it and it's FREE. Fave middle eastern food hands down.", "author": "Mace L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-16", "description": "The food was not that great, but it wasn't bad either. My problem was with the service and the sexism of one of the staff members.\n\nThe servers were not welcoming or warm. Food was put on the table without even an acknowledgment that there were people seated there. \nWhen we were done with our meal I and a man from our party went up to the register. I wanted to split the check and he wanted to pick up the tab. The host completely ignored me, not even acknowledging I was there, took my friends card and swiped it. When I asked him why he was ignoring me and listening to my friend, he said it was because he was a man. \n\nThat was the rudest and most sexist remark I ever received from anyone working in service. I most definitely would not be going back and would never recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Hajar A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-09", "description": "Always looking for new cuisines to try and this one definitely is a new fave.

Having been lauded in various local publications, I already expected it to be good, but what struck me also was how truly authentic it felt. \n\nThe menu presents an interesting variety of Middle Eastern cuisine anchored by poultry and lamb dishes. I tried the Chicken Agda which is an exotically spiced stew with vegetables served with a big side of rice. My friend had the chicken kebabs which also looked awesome. We shared the fatah with honey (though I see now it's more of a dessert) which was probably the most interesting thing - A Yemeni pita chopped up and mixed with honey, and topped with this amazing yogurt-butter mixture. Whoa, just an awesome and satisfying flavor combination. Combined with the complimentary pita and delicious soup and salad they give you when you're seated, it was a sumptuous meal.\n\nThe service at Yemen Caf\u00e9 is a little gruff (I remarked to my friend that no one greets you as you walk in, and you basically just seat yourself) but I chalk that up to more authenticity. The crowd dining here was a mixture of families (mostly Middle Easterners) and a handful of hipsters because we are in Brooklyn after all. The prices here are downright cheap too, so this is really an excellent, interesting option in Downtown Brooklyn and one I certainly look forward to coming back for.", "author": "Justin S."}], "servesCuisine": "Middle Eastern", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Yemen Cafe \u0026 Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "176 Atlantic Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vslOvCtDTQrVpozoKYH02A/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188349533"}
