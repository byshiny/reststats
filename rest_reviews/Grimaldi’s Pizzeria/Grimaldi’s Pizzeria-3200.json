The crust was just so yummy, and perfectly thin and crisp, with a bit of char in the edges (gotta love that coal oven).  The sauce had the right proportion of tomato flavor and sweetness, and they don't put too much of it.  The mozzarella was fresh and melted perfectly.  Probably the only thing I would change would be a put in a bit more basil, but that's a matter of personal preference really (I looove basil), so I would just order a double portion of it if I ever come back.\n\nHubby got sausage and mushroom again on his half of the pizza, which was still pretty good, but IMO not as good as the original one, since the sausage flavor overpowers the rest of the ingredients, and makes it more greasy.\n\nSince it was a weekday, the line didn't seem to bad...it took us around half an hour before we got in, and around 15-20 min after to get our pizza.  There was this old Italian guy who seemed to be the \"expediter\" and got people in from the line fairly efficiently so the tables were pretty much filled at all times.\n\nI gotta say though, the pizza was totally worth the wait, and going all the way to Brooklyn.  I would go back to this place in a heartbeat if I'm ever back in NY.  This place puts Amici's to shame.  Dammit, why can't we get pizza like this in California?

My NY friends took us here saying it was the best, and it did not disappoint.

Absolutely the best pizza. We tested a plain cheese pizza, which is the pizza litmus test.  They have the whole formula down to a science. Fresh mozzerella.  Not \"fresh\" but actually fresh, as in the soft stuff you marinate in olive olive oil. Fresh basil leaves. A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. A sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper. Lucious sauce. All atop a super thin crust and put into a blazingly hot coal-fired oven. Oh so amazing.  We had the secret coffee soda too which was so yummy I almost asked for another while waiting for our pie, but didn't because it was so busy. I am glad I didn't get another because it's a super sugared turbo charged caffeine rush which had me buzzing after just one.\n\nIt's worth the wait, the special trip to Brooklyn, enduring the snooty natives who sat next to us continually carping about mysterious breaches of ettiquette we tourists were making, and said natives wouldn't get up to let an old person to their seat, etc., etc.", "author": "Cynthia C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-12", "description": "Oh my god, I have been craving Grimaldi's since I visited. I haven't found anything like it in Philly.\n\nThis is exactly the way I like my pizza - fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, not too much sauce, and thin crust that is very slightly singed. Next time I'll get extra basil.\n\nService is surly, but astonishingly fast. They don't like their patrons to linger very long after the food is gone. The space is tiny, so be prepared to become friendly with your neighbors at the next table.", "author": "Meg C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-26", "description": "The first restaurant I visited on my trip to New York.  Grimaldi's is considered one of the top 3 pizza places in New York; and I was fully prepared for a 2 hour wait which can be quite common.\n\nFortunately, we only had to wait five minutes to get a table; which was excellent.\n\nThe interior looked like any classic pizza parlor; with red checker cloth table covers, etc.  Seats were jammed very close together; resulting in sitting elbow to elbow with other patrons.\n\nAlthough we were seated quickly, it prob. took 15 minutes for someone to come by and take our order.\n\n20 minutes later, the large Pepperoni arrived.  A sparse covering of cheese, sauce and small pep slices along with a single leaf of basil.\n\nThe result... Pretty good pizza, but nothing to die for.  Not as flavorful as other NY style pizzas I have had in my life.  Overall, solid, but not memorable in any way.\n\nSome of the slices I grabbed from random places over the next few days were just as good.\n\nIf you want the classic pizza experience, visit Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.", "author": "Sam H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-18", "description": "Always a long line but we didn't have to wait long since we were willing to sit at the bar.

This is a prefect nyc place to experience what this city is all about. Good food, hometown pride, and local nyc history. Oh, and it is smack under the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nYou have your choice of a regular pie, or large pie- No slices here. And the wines are cheap- $4 by the glass (hellz yea). So... this was hands down the best pizza I have ever had. It tastes a little different then traditional NY pizza, but so much better.

Who knows if this is the best technically executed pizza I've had, or if the 45 minute standing wait and surrounding hype help to soften any unflattering angles if there were any, but I never fail to swoon as soon as the tangy mozzarella splotched, perfectly crispy bed of juicy tomato sauce and co.

No.  Juliana's down the street is the same pizza without the wait, and if you are willing to venture a little farther into Brooklyn, places like Lucali and Giuseppina's are even better.

I think a significant factor behind this has to do with consistency and how difficult that is to maintain as a place gets as popular as Grimaldi's has become.\n\nThe line to get in can often be ridiculously long during busy hours and that also takes away from the experience for those that like to go consistently. It's fine for going your first time as I'd think the rating one might give might be higher in this case, but if you want to go to a place consistently not having to wait on line for 30 minutes becomes more important to consider.\n\nA really good place for pizza to go to, also for its location, but if you don't want to wait forever to eat there are other options equally as good or better now-a-days.", "author": "Isaac B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-04-02", "description": "My friend will kill me, but I'm sorry to say - the sauce killed it.

Thanks to Yelp, I felt the need to go there. And since my friend who works in downtown Brooklyn got out of work much earlier than me, I forced him to go early and start waiting in line. \n\nWait time: I went late afternoon/ early evening on a weekday, right after work. The wait was only 15- 20 minutes long. It really wasn't that bad. However, when my friends and I left, there was a long line building up. I guess everyone was getting ready for dinner?\n\nService: Everyone looked so miserable. They weren't exactly rude to me, but they didn't seem to make much of an effort to come outside and tell us there were open tables or spend too much time helping each customer. \n\nPizza: Three other people and I shared a garlic all over, half pepperoni and half mushroom large pizza.  Price came out to be like $7-8 per person. It was very flavorful and filling, and I would say better than another brick oven place (john's?) I went to in Manhattan that had a long line. However, my Michigan friend who has had Chicago-style pizza said it was not bad...\"but it's not amazing.\" It's also suggested that if you go here, don't go for just plain cheese pizza.
