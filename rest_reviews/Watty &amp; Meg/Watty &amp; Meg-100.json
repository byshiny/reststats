Finally we had to leave after we noticed the table behind us who still didn't have their order taken, or a drink and had been there the entire time we had.

The bartender was super nice and recommended a great red. Tuna tartare was great - lots of flavor - but I would have liked a few more yuca chips to eat it on. In fact, I thought they had forgotten to bring the yuca chips until I realized that the 3 shoved into the top of the (delicious) heap of raw tuna were all I would be getting.\n\nCan't comment on most of the menu, but I'd definitely go back for more wine and snacks!", "author": "Shawn H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-11", "description": "I walked up to Watty \u0026 Meg for their Saturday Brunch.  I saw that the place was quite busy and was unsure if I'd have to wait for a table or not.  Upon talking to the host he asked me if I could sit at the bar, I really wanted a table near the patio because it was a marvelously sunny day.  I politely told the host that I would prefer a table for 1 and he politely obliged my request, even though the restaurant was fairly packed.  \nThe waitress was very nice, even though I could see she was working with many tables and little help from other wait staff.  I did wait longer than the general amount of time it should take to get water and coffee, but since it was a busy time of the day it obviously took a little longer.  The tables near the patio are wonderful, reading and people-watching was a nice way to spend time while I waited for my meal.\nI had ordered the hash with poached eggs and salmon.  After the waitress delivered my meal I was very pleased with it.  The salmon was good, poached eggs perfect, and the hash with brussels sprouts were delicious!  Overall, I was very pleased with my experience and would eat here again!  But I would only recommend their Brunch if people aren't in a hurry.

My cocktail was good and what I really appreciated was that  our server steered me away from something she didn't think I'd like. Good looking out.

Really great, comfortable corner space and good food. The original owner was present and truly interested in customer feedback at the beginning. As he seemed less and less present (change in ownership? we never found out) the food started to take a dive and we walked away. That was over two years ago.\n\nWith out of town guests in Brooklyn this weekend, we decided to give W\u0026M another chance.\n\nWell, it seems that ol' Brussels sprouts has finally fallen from popularity as the ubiquitous \"veggie of the moment.\" Thank god.  And if you didn't get the memo, the much touted and so-called \"superfood\" kale has taken over the top spot. And that was never more obvious than with the chef at Watty \u0026 Meg, who put it in nearly everything, to the ruination of our meal.\n\nThe appetizer of kale and quinoa salad with avocado sounded good. Though the menu failed to tell me that it was a de-constructed salad, as it arrived at my table with each ingredient in a neat and separate pile on a rectangular plate. The fresh, raw kale was cut relatively small and lemoned and salted appropriately. Nice. The quinoa in the middle was a sad hockey puck form still with the chill of the refrigerator on it as well as small underripe slices of mango (apparently they don't know how to pick fruit at the market) with no flavor to help the bland disk before me. Fail. The avocado was neither sliced nor cruda  as I would have preferred, but just a tablespoon sized dollop of avocado pudding with no personality that left me wondering about its inclusion in the dish. What was this to accompany, the quinoa or the kale? No sure it would have paired with or helped either. My partner had the tuna tartare, which was spicy and fresh with lively peppers and/or tomatoes in the bottom of the formed disk it was presented in. Nice.\n\nThen it all went to hell. I was sharing an entree of haddock and crabmeat with my GF. It presented well, centered in a large plate with a deep impression, fish nicely broiled and the crabmeat packed on top of this. But to the side was another dollop of avocado (?) and it was completely, heavy-handedly covered with confetti ribbons of flash fried KALE. Which, because of the way it was prepared added nothing to the dish, in fact destroyed the dish because you could not effectively remove it. It was, in size, color, texture and in-edibility, the equivalent of fake grass in an Easter basket.\n\nTo top it off, my GF, in an effort to avoid the plastic kale strips, took a low approach with her fork to go directly to the haddock, and seconds later was choking on a mouthful of bones. When finally flagged down, the waitress seemed blas\u00e9. \"Oh, sorry, I'll bring you some water.\" And later a free scoop of ice cream. Whoo hoo!\n\nOne of our guests had a pasta dish that also contained kale, though thankfully cooked.\n\nOut of fear and the desire for another beer, I skipped desert. Though the rest of the table each imbibed. Though it is worth noting that the berry schnitzel, which was really a cobbler, contained quinoa.\n\nThis idea of cross-migrating ingredients across your entire menu is a lazy and mostly unsuccessful concept. And our experience is a perfect example of why.", "author": "Noisy V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-18", "description": "I should preface this by saying that the food here is great and the aesthetics are delightful. \n\nI have been to Watty \u0026 Meg on several occasions. When they first opened, the food, service, and ambiance were fantastic. However, it seems like with each subsequent visit, the service gets weaker and weaker. \n\nDuring our most recent brunch, the service was laughably bad. I felt like I was in some sort of Brooklyn spoof comedy. Our waitress arrived at our table and stood there for and awkward ten seconds looking bored for before asking if we wanted anything to drink. It was really difficult to get coffee and milk refills. All requests were met with unenthusiastic responses, despite the fact that the place was nearly empty and there were plenty of servers and a bartender. I get it- it's Sunday brunch and we're all tired and hungover, but we can do better. \n\nOne of the specials was a heirloom roasted tomato omelette and it presented as an unroasted, plain grape tomato omelette. A dish ordered without potatoes was served with potatoes. Neither of these things ruined the day, but with the overall unpleasant vibe of the place proved irritating. \n\nI really want to like this place, as it's in our neighborhood and has nice food, but I'd rather avoid feeling condescended to by servers in the future. \n\nI'd love to see improved effort in the service, as it would really make this place a go-to in Cobble Hill.", "author": "Meghan G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-16", "description": "First off, I've been a loyal customer since they first opened and always had a good experience.  What happened?  My experience on Sunday...not good.\n\nI was alone so I sat at the bar.  Just wanted a quick something yummy and be on my way.  Sat for almost 10 straight minutes staring at the bartender who busied himself at the other end of the bar and never glanced at me.  Didn't want to shout to get his attention.  Looked to catch the eye of a server walking by but couldn't.  \n\nFinally the bartender got near enough that I could say \"can I get a menu please!\" loudly and he did look kind of startled, I think because I sat in a seat someone had vacated he assumed I was still that person (their stuff was still there, hadn't been cleared.  Yuck.)\n\nHe brought the menu and cleaned up.  A nice little salad caught my eye - yellow watermelon, arugula, shaved red onlon, Marcona almonds, dijon vinaigrette.  Done.\n\nProblem 1 - watermelon was pink, not yellow.  So much for exotic ingredients, I was looking forward to yellow watermelon.  Problem 2 - shaved onion? (I think that's what it said) - this was an entire onion sliced and about equal in quantity to the arugula.  I don't want to eat an onion salad!  I tried to pick it out because mouthfuls of onion is really gross - this isn't a vegetable people!  It's a cheap trick.  That left very little \"salad\".  Problem 3 - there were 3 almonds, and they weren't Marcona almonds, they were just regular ones.  So much for a more unique and delightful add in - I ordered the salad just because of my love of Marcona almonds, I thought it was a nice touch.  Too bad they don't actually use them.\n\nI know this is picky but really....what a STUPID salad.  I told the bartender as it made me pretty cranky and he offered to comp me a glass of wine.  I said no but thanks.  The bill comes and it's $17.  Haha!  For this stupid salad and a glass of club soda.  I had to laugh - I told him - why not comp the club soda??  You offered to comp wine!  (Hell, he should've comped the salad).  And he took it off the bill, but I don't think I should have had to point it out.\n\nYou know, it's the little things in life.  Or it's say what the thing is, put down the creative writing - yellow watermelon, Marcona almonds - to sell something and then give the customer something different and mundane.
