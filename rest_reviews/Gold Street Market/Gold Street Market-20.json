They're good. Not super fantastic. But still respectable food. This last time I ordered their lamb schwarma. They ask if you want it with white and red sauce and what kind of bread. I said sure to the sauces and I wanted it on a pita! Turns out the sauces are like a mayo/yogurt/tzatziki type sauce and hot sauce. Pretty good, pretty good. Though I did get this at 3am. Score for being open 24 hours! I finished the other half of this two days later and it was still edible.", "author": "Kim P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-29", "description": "Last night I came to Gold Street Market and something I wasn't expecting happened. I ordered two panini sandwiches to go (Chicken Fajita and Tuna Melt). They both came on pita instead of bread! At first I was a little worried because I was really expecting two slices of panini-pressed white, wheat or Italian/French bread.  However, once I started eating them, I was impressed! They were both delicious. Perhaps it shouldn't have surprised me as much as it did, but I thought it was worthwhile to update my review so that others know about the pita in case it's not your thing. \n\nAs an aside, the Chicken Fajita was much better than the Tuna Melt. I tend to like my tuna melts on the cheesier side, and this one just wasn't very cheesy. After having been here well over a dozen times, I can tell you that my favorite sandwich is the FDNY - breaded chicken cutlet, cheese, lettuce and tomato. I think it's noted on the page now, but they are officially open 24 hours a day!", "author": "Calvin D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "Great selection of food for decent prices and the employees are super friendly.

The staff is extremely friendly, and there is no minimum for credit/debit cards. I have had 2 subs and a breakfast sandwich. All were well priced, nicely portioned, and tasty! They also have a great selection of household goods/groceries for anything you might have forgotten at the supermarket. \n\nLove this place!", "author": "Michelle B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-23", "description": "LOVE this place!

It is conveniently located between the two Brooklyn Gold buildings. It's great for grabbing something on the go, or as Calvin D said, for when you're cooking dinner and realized that you've missed an ingredient. While it is on the small side, it is stocked with a large variety of items. Prices are extremely reasonable, especially on the fruit. Check out their bakery section. They have hugeeeee danishes/donuts for only 1.50. Insane! The employees here are also very friendly. Plenty of check-ins to come!", "author": "Marla B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-09", "description": "Like all other deli/corner stores in NYC, Gold Street can be seen as \"overpriced\".  However, the entire staff here is consistently friendly, no matter what day of the week. I sometimes go here to grab a quick lunch. The deli's Chicken Ceasar Wrap is their best keep secret (I like to add olives).  And, yes, they deliver.", "author": "Scott G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-29", "description": "Best convenience store ever! Great selection (boyfriend and I like to joke that they have four cans/cartons/boxes of every food on earth), and the nicest employees. They are always great to chat with, even at 2am! They often ask what we'd like to see on their shelves, and it's fun to see our suggestions appear a few weeks later. \n\nOne wish: Please bring back the s'mores ice cream! We bought it once, it was AMAZING, and then we never saw it again.", "author": "H P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-28", "description": "I really like this place.
