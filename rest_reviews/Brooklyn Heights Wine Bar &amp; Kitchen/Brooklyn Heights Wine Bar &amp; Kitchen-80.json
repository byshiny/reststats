I thoroughly enjoyed the wine and my friend did not waste any of his Dewars and Water.  Quiet relaxing atmosphere with well selected background music.  Definitely my Brooklyn Heights go to place.  Reasonable priced, good pour and a good wine selection that has descriptions for both bottles and glasses.  Erica was a true \nvictualler / barkeep / oenophile.  Everything is done from scratch with some old school touches.  Nice crowd and  had a nice conversation with two good guys Bill and Bob.\n\nNote the lady behind the bar was Erica.  Nice to go some place where they know what they are doing....", "author": "James D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-10", "description": "What a great place!

Uggh... \n\nAh, to elaborate: how does one mess up slicing a bunch of salami and prosciutto anyway? Leave it to this dining establishment to perfect this trick: for the salami, the pieces (all 3 of them) were too huge to eat uncut. The prosciutto was on the fatty side and anemically pale. \n\nOur mains came out in a timely manner yet this was the one silver lining. The burgers were okay but nothing to write home about and more cooked than requested. The pasta with shrimp was mostly the latter. Comparatively, I lucked out by asking for my pulled pork to have sauce on the side and somewhat enjoyed this crispy but quite salty dish.\n\nSomeone--seemingly the owner--stopped by to check on us but how does a customer relay that the whole menu needs to be scrapped? Kiddos for trying but...sigh... such disappointment from a wine bar. Who would have thought?", "author": "Kristina K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-22", "description": "We almost passed by this place because it looked legit closed when we were walking by trying to find a brunch spot! \n\nThe food was a great price point for the area, and I loved what I got which was the burger with gruyere and fried onions. I will admit, the SMELL of the melty gruyere was a bit pugnent (I mean, I was a little taken aback when it first got to the table because DAMN that cheese smelled RANK), but after I started eating it my olfactory senses were beginning to get used to it. The salad that came with it was appreciated as I need more green in my diet usually. I tried a new Ommegang brew that I hadn't tried yet (Rare Vos, a little too syrupy for my taste but I think would be better if I drank it faster/while it was cold). \n\nMy friend was a little disappointed with the warm shaved brussel sprouts salad with pancetta, Parmesan and lemon - it was kind of lacking in some flavors, and instead of being full or bits of brussel sprouts it looked simply like alfafa sprouts with a few measly pieces of pancetta. Other friend loved the bloody maria she got though, and our waitress was super accommodating in that she was willing to let me try samples of beers before I made my decision!\n\nIf I lived in the area I would definitely come back! :)", "author": "Stephanie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-29", "description": "This place is a great find, big selection of wines by the glass and a nice and welcoming atmosphere. The staff and service are always great, and I've always been able to have my questions about the wines answered. \n\nThe warm pretzel bites are great, probably my favorite thing that I've had there. \n\nI've ordered the cheese plate on two separate occasions and thought that it was much smaller the second time. The prices of the cheeses may have changed, which could account for the smaller portions, but I still think the cost was a little steep for the quantity.\n\nIt's a small place, so sometimes it can get a little loud inside, but overall, it's a great and cozy place to grab drinks and food with friends.", "author": "Emily J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-30", "description": "I am not an avid reviewer however the customer service was terrible enough for me to feel the need to write one.

My date of the evening had the burger, which he said was delicious, and I had the salt cod fish pie. What I loved about my dish was that it also came with plenty of crusty buttery slices of bread.\n\nThe service here is friendly and quick. Our waitress was there for me when my wine glass was nearly empty, ready to refill it. \n\nI'm glad I finally checked out this place after walking by it a million times, given that I work in the area and there's nothing like a good glass of red wine after a hard day of work!", "author": "Julia B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-11", "description": "Casual, inviting wine bar with a reliable drink menu: several wines, great cocktails, + a variety of beers.

Fresh glasses of Shiraz made it to my table as quickly as I could drink them (... perhaps too quickly, but that's my fault).\n\nThe food menu consists of lighter bites.
