Without a doubt one of the most uninspiring salads in my life. Just as unspiring as the waiters and maitre d' who didn't seem to care about their level of blas\u00e9. Why maitre d' has to be snotty I don't get.\n\nThe place was only half full so it wasn't an issue of stress. It was so obviously obvious that no one could ever be satisfied with so little food so we politely pointed this out and we asked could we at least have some bread with this? Four half dried thin slices of bread was dropped  by our table without a word. No sorrys, no nothing.  \n\nWhere's Chef Ramsay when you need him?!\n\nNot going back.

From perfectly cooked al dante pasta bowls, to firewood baked pizza pies you can split or enjoy solo. The staff is attentive and will never steer you wrong when asked for menu suggestions. A few dished i have tried and recommend thus far : tartufata signature pizza (im not even into mushrooms, but this was delicious), fettuccine bolognese (pasta and meat sauce, saucy in all the right places), and a great and healthy avocado gambretti salad (with shrimp)!!", "author": "Tahsya M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-15", "description": "The short:\n\nThe pizzas are consistently delicious, the BYO keeps the cost down, the wait staff is friendly and relatively attentive but the owner/manager that lingers around, is awkward and a bit rude. Downtown BK has been in desperate need of some eateries and, while not amazing, it is good to have a local pizza place.\n\nThe long:\n\nI was waiting with great anticipation for Forno Rosso to open and since it has I've been there a few times.  If I didn't live in a restaurant-deprived area then I probably wouldn't have returned after my second visit.\n\nThe second time that my wife and I went there the service was a little discombobulated.  We had one person take our appetizer order, two other people offer to tell us about the specials and then forth person (the owner/manager) took our dinner order.  We ordered one of their pizzas and the chicken milanese special.  \n\nIt wasn't a terribly long wait for the food but once it arrived we realized that the pizza was a white pizza, not the one with marinara that we ordered.  Understanding that the restaurant is new, combined with not wanting to wait longer for another pizza while the chicken got cold, we decided to keep the pizza that we were served and just ask for some marinara sauce.\n\nI flagged down the owner/manager and my wife asked for a side of marinara.  The guy then said in an extremely condescending tone, \"oh, did you not understand that you were ordering a pizza without sauce.\"  To which I felt the need to reply \"um, no ... you brought us the wrong dish, we didn't order a bianca pizza.\"  \n\nAt that point he said nothing and left.  We waited 10 minutes and thought to ourselves - why is this taking so long - maybe he's bringing us the pie we ordered accompanied by an apology.  Wrong - he came back with a small side of sauce, plopped it down and left without a word.  Needless to say, I was not pleased with his attitude or the fact that ultimately we ate a cold pizza that we didn't want.\n\nWhy is this guy there?  If a restaurant decides to have the manager on the floor it should be to ensure efficiency, make the customers comfortable, and occasionally smooth over issues created by the servers or the kitchen.  Instead this guy was the issue.  He just walks around pretending he's the mayor shaking hands and patting people on the back while contributing little to (and in our case detracting greatly from) the actual experience.\n\nThat said, the pizza is good and it's nice to have another restaurant in the neighborhood.  I just make it a point to get take out or try and deal with the owner/manager/mayor/guy-sitting-at-the-bar-staring-at-his-phone as little as possible.  \n\nNote - It's interesting to see how many of the reviews are from people with only 1 or 2 reviews on their profile ... just sayin'", "author": "Collin B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-31", "description": "Went for dinner over the weekend.  Service was pushy on ordering extras, drinks, etc. My sea bass did not come deboned, but was well cooked. The atmosphere was more that of a bar than a restaurant, complete with soccer on tv. Overall, it was meh. With different expectations, I might not have been so disappointed.", "author": "Irene S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-03", "description": "Wow! They make some of the best pizza I've had. For calibration - we spent a week in New York and went there three times. Yes, three times despite the fact that there's so much other good food around. OK, the third time was to pick up a backpack I'd left there the previous night but nobody protested at the thought to have lunch there the following day ... \n\nPretty much all pizze are great. Some of my favorites are the Margherita (the one with house made mozzarella and not with the mozzarella di bufala) and the Rosemary Bianca. But even their bread served with the starter is delicious. Nice sourdough and very chewy. And don't get me started on the desserts. Excellently done, albeit a bit pricy compared to the pizze. The coffee is well done - typical Italian bar coffee. Not the single origin high end roasts you get at Grumpy and co. but the type of coffee you'd find in Italy. \n\nThe staff are super friendly. Some of them are still a bit green but all try to do a good job. The interior design is perfectly executed (good color coordination with the red brick oven, stone, steel, glass, Italian posters, firewood). Almost too perfectly done for a single restaurant (we asked several times if they were part of a franchise just because it all matched so well that it was unusual to find in a restaurant of this type). \n\nIn summary - go there now while they're starting up. I'm fairly sure the place will be packed soon. Right now the pizza is a bargain given what you're getting.", "author": "Alex S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-22", "description": "I can't testify to the restaurant's quality, per-se. I stumbled in here while walking around in need of a cold beer and a bathroom. What I can say about this place is that 1) They now have, verifyably, their liquor license, and 2) There's a vocal energy about this place (the hostess, the bartender and even the chef, himself) that they're proud of what they've made here for the downtown community, and they intend to be a mainstay. Good luck to them. It is a lovely place.", "author": "J.C. M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-13", "description": "The place is fairly new and allows BYOB. We ordered a couple of pizzas and the gnocchi. The italian in the group gave a solid thumbs up for the dishes and I concur. The crust was perfectly crunchy and the cheese was perfectly cooked. \n\nI also loved the ambiance too. The industrial look mixed with the vintage posters reminded me of San Francisco. This is definitely the best brooklyn based italian restaurant that I can recommend.

But wait I save the best for last... (drum role please) THE PIZZA!  The pizza is made in the red oven which you can see from the dining room, which is so so cool. All of the pizza was amazing. I am pretty sure we had more but I remember and love the Siciliana, Margherita, and Blanca.

The appetizers are pretty large portions. Pizzas are really very good. They don't serve alcohol just yet, but  allow you to bring your own.
