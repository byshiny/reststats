This is not a bad review. I  had the Sushi Omakase. Sat at the sushi bar.   It all came out on one plate,  no complaints as I was kinda not feeling like one piece at a time.  It was of good value and the service was very attentive and welcoming.  No complaints. \nIn this neighborhood, delivery service was very busy, and I attribute that to a Rainy Monday night.\nI ordered a few individual pieces, all of the fish was good.\nMy only disappointment was that the Sushi Chef's did not season the rice with Wasabi under the fish.  I guess I am just used to that presentation and taste, I do wonder why they don't season the fish, but it could be the clientele or the target.  If they've been asked for years for more wasabi and soy sauce at the table, then they've adjusted to that. I really can't blame them. I just like it the old school way. \nregardless, I really enjoyed my meal at Ki Sushi, I would return, but It's not supplanting my  favorite places.  \nFor people who like Rolls , the menu seemed creative and interesting, just not my thing. \nOtherwise, the fish is great.

The rolls are delicious and created by experts. The traditional way to eat a simple roll  is without soy sauce because the rice already contains a little soy.

A bit of curiosity, perhaps, at a sushi place consistently considered one of the best places in Brooklyn, even if that moniker does not mean comparability to the best of Manhattan.  More specifically, to please my sushi-seeking sibling who can't be bothered with my highfalutin talk of standards and is perfectly happy with her local Chinese-run sushi place offering half-price spicy tuna rolls all the time.\n\nKi Sushi is attractive, a brick and stone paved space with dark wood furniture.  The lighting, just a bit dim for lunch, lends to a warm, sophisticated ambience.  Seats are comfortable with room between tables.  The sushi bar sits near the end, lined with a row of seats.  The staff are responsive and courteous.\n\nAn assortment of lunch specials includes sushi, special rolls, and bento boxes.  The full menu abounds with random Japanese classics (gyoza, yakitori, agedashi tofu, miso soup), dishes with non-Japanese touches (truffles, lobster, gold leaf, fig glaze, pine nuts),  and a long list of special rolls that looks like most typical Americanized sushi restaurant lists, but more polished with consistently better ingredients.  Many salads, soups, appetizers, and entrees, in addition to choosing from sushi and sashimi.\n\nWhen in doubt about the sushi skills of a restaurant, my go-to dish is chirashizushi, where \"chirashi\" literally means \"scattered,\" a bowl of vinegared sushi rice topped with fresh fish and just about anything else.  As a way to judge both fish and rice without the sushi commitment, its a good way to go.  Ki Sushi's chirashi was beautifully presented and topped with good, very fresh fish; nothing fancy, just the common maguro, hamachi, sake, mackeral, tamago, and a bit of oshinko.  With pickled ginger and wasabi, it can be mixed all together before eating, or not as you like.  The rice was decent, with a hint of vinegar.\n\nTheir special rolls are also well presented, and better in every way from the low-end cheap sushi places, expected as the quality of their ingredients is a good step up.  I prefer simplicity over theatrics, so I tried one piece for the record but will prefer a classic negi fish roll from a top tier place anytime.\n\nKi Sushi is an excellent mid-tier sushi place, and one of the best sushi places in Brooklyn.  It is not for those seeking rigorous technique and attention to tradition, nor for those who only want the very best (head to Manhattan, there's plenty to choose from there).  It is not cheap sushi, and is priced accordingly, but there's good quality fish to be had in a lovely setting with good service, without long lines to get in.", "author": "Valery C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-28", "description": "Ki is hands down my favorite Japanese/Sushi restaurant in Brooklyn and possibly Manhattan. Their service is always impeccable, fish is consistently fresh and my dining experience is always on point. \n\nI've been to Ki 10 times or so over the past year and I've never had a bad experience. If you're looking for a great meal with an explorative menu, I would highly recommend Ki.

They've always had extremely fresh and tasty fish, creative rolls and dishes, and a solid menu. A few years back, they raised their prices... I didn't really notice much at first - until I found another almost-as-good sushi spot in the hood, and then realized I was paying more than twice what I should have been for years... \n\nThis is def one of the top 2 places in this area, but I'd rather pay $14 than $32 for the same rolls and apps on a normal delivery night. The food is great - just think about where you wanna be throwin' your cash...", "author": "Brad D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-17", "description": "This review is mostly centered on the supreme omakase (35?), but I also had a Ki special roll. \n\nTo start, I wanted to say that this place was really packed. I read a couple of reviews saying that they did not honor their reservations, but I did not have a problem. The waiters and servers were quite attentive and knowledgeable. \n\nI was seated at the counter because I wanted the full omakase experience, (one by one) but I didn't expect it. Of course, it did not happen, but I do not blame them one bit. The omakase experience here is very... touched up with business ethics. Of course, this place is not solely an omakase joint because it needs to make business by doing local deliveries and offers specials and etc. I mean, their primarily going to be focused on those regular rolls and local deliveries. Basically, it is like any other sushi joint, except that it serves omakase. \n\nI had a couple of appetizers like gyoza, and the toro tartare. It was pretty standard stuff, but the toro tartare, albeit really good and showed me the fresh quality of the fish, was not worth the money. It is about 1/4 the size of my palm for 14 dollars. My advice is get the gyoza if you want, which was pretty good, but skip the toro tartare. \n\nAs noted above, I talked about the business like ethics of Ki sushi. With that said, the business-like ethics of this sushi joint dis not deter them from serving a great \"supreme omakase.\" Although I did not get the full experience, I got the freshest fish available and the best tasting items available. \n\n**side note: In a full experience omakase, the chef hands you the pieces one by one and makes sure he caters to your taste buds. That is why, the most special pieces are not served at the beginning of the meal. He has to make sure to get the exact ratio of wasabi, soy sauce, etc. At ki sushi, and I suspect at every other classier sushi joint that offers omakase, you will get all the pieces in a plate which will be delivered to you by a waiter. Of course, as I said, this version of the omakase does not mean it is any less tasty. \n\nThere were 4 super special pieces along with 5 other pieces. \nGolden eyed snapper\nCalifornia Uni\nToro\nScallop\n\nThe other five were:\nArctic something\nSaba\nSomething Mackerel\nAmberjack\nSomething\n\nI really enjoyed every single one of their special nigiri pieces. I cannot stress the quality of ingredients used. My favorite of course was the Uni, but the Golden eyed snapper was very good too. I suspect that umami taste came from a torch though. The toro was on point and so was the scallop. I did not have high expectations for the scallop, but I was proven wrong. \n\nThe regular pieces were quite delicious too, except that I do not like mackerel at all. To me, it always tastes so fishy, and honestly, I have had mackerel at top tier sushi joints, and they are also fishy. I think it is just the nature of the mackerel to be fishy. \n\nOverall, these things were quite delicious, and so I asked for another piece of California Uni and golden eyed snapper and then another Ki roll. \n\nFor the uni, they had wanted me to try Hokkaido uni instead, but charged me for a California uni, which was very very nice of them. The hokkaido uni was just as good as the California uni, but it has a distinct flavor which tasted more like an ocean breeze. I loved it. \n\nNow for the Ki roll.... to me, it was like a special roll from any other sushi joint's. This is where the -1 star comes from. No offense, ki sushi, but you guys served me an greatomakase, and I'm sure your Ki roll tastes amazing to people who haven't had your omakase but it pretty much showed me the difference between the quality of fish used in your regular orders and the omakase. Like I said before, if you are not coming here for the omakase, then you are coming to just another sushi joint. I'm not trying to say don't come here for rolls, but the supreme omakase is THE thing to get here. So if you really want to see what the hype with this place is, or if you REALLY want to taste superbly made sushi, don't get the regular sushi rolls, drop some extra cash and try the supreme omakase. \n\nI am definitely going to recommend this place for Omakase. I will be back to try the Ki omakase, which is not made with ingredients flown in from japan.", "author": "Edward M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "In an effort to get away from the neighborhoods (sheepshead bay) typical sushi joints, we ventured out to Cobble Hill one night.

It's you.\"  So, of course - I have to try it right?  It's Yelp and like all things you read online, it's gotta be true!\n\nSo my fine friend was craving for sushi, so we got the famous Ki roll, Rainbow roll, and a Sashimi deluxe.  First off, the service was awesome.  Beyond having a warm wet towel to wash up before eating, there's a slice of lemon in our water.  Only 8.53% of all the restaurants I've been do actually gives lemon in your water automatically so that's a big win for Ki already.  FF was not impressed.  The Ki roll was awesome to me, but FF was a bit apprehensive about eating a gold leaf.  Like the Ki, the Rainbow roll was also packed with fresh fish.\n\nSashimi deluxe came and FF apparently isn't really into salad - odd I thought, seeing how she's so... fine.  Every single piece of fish I found was freakin fresh.  But FF was not impressed.\n\nFor dessert, I wanted to bring FF to a cute place I know with some pretty awesome Chocolate cake - surprise her with a candle in it for her Birthday.  She shows me a picture of a slice of chocolate cake she had the day before at Peter Luger... with a candle in it.  *sad face*  Instead we stayed and ordered the banana and ice cream.  That she liked.\n\nI went home with a *sad face* and later in the evening I had two pieces of the Ki and Rainbow roll left over that was doggie bagged.  Opened up the paper bag to find a menu wrapped in a rubber band with a tiny dish, 4 packs of soy sauce, wasabi and ginger in my sushi container.  Never in my entire life in my doggy-bagging career have I ever had utensils included in my take home bag.
