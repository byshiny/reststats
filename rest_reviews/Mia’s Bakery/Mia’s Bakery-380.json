I popped in to get a cake for a xmas party my friend was throwing around the corner. Amazing selection. Unfortunately they had ran of the strawberry shortbread cake which I'd heard is so delicious got the triple chocolate instead and was so happy with my choice. It was moist, rich but not too heavy. Everyone loved it at the party too. The sales girls favorite cake is vanilla maybe I'll get that one next", "author": "pamela b."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-30", "description": "Totally addictive!

Their croissants are great, tasty and huge! Yesterday i was thinking to bring a cake to a friend's thanksgiving dinner. And Mia came to mine mind. I got a 7' 7 layers cake, I simply picked this one by its gorgeous look. It didn't fail us by its soft, sweet but not too heavy flavor. The mousse is fine and smooth, the chocolate outer layer is perfect. Will definitely come here more often and recommend it to more friends!", "author": "Yingwen L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-08", "description": "This is literally the best cheesecake I have ever had. I have been on the hunt for good cheesecake in NYC and I have tried most of the places that are supposed to be \"the best\" but have always been a bit let down. Not here. Creamy, rich, hint of vanilla, hint of sweetness, a tiny bit of tartness, the graham cracker crust is magnificent. Seriously, go get this cheesecake. I have gotten other things too here and they are all good. I can't wait to try more cupcakes and breakfast pastries and coffee. This place is amazing. Been waiting for something like this to open in the neighborhood! Wish one would open in Park Slope too!", "author": "Joanna V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-14", "description": "Ordered Mia's Bakery through Uber eats. Easy to order and a quick delivery. We got the Oreo cheesecake and coconut cake. Both equally delicious. The coconut cake was super soft and melted right in your mouth. Oreo cheesecake was great with Oreo pieces inside big enough to feel that crunch.

You're made to feel warm and welcome. Service is always quick, with great attention to detail.  You know you've found a home when after not seeing a \"customer\" for two weeks, that \"you\" walk into  an establishment and you're told that you've been missed and it feels genuine.

I have bought birthday cakes here...cup cakes...cookies pie omg THE BANANA PUDDING IS JUST AMAZING. I bought one and shared it with a friend who is now going out of her way to buy from this bakery lol. The staff is incredibly friendly and as sweet as the products they sell. I deff recommend you pay a visit here. Keep in mind it can be a bit pricey ($3 for a single cookie) but it is sooooo worth the price.", "author": "Jason V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-01", "description": "I have gone to Mias a few times to pick up some cake/cupcakes.  Food has always been delicious.  Favorites so far are the carrot cake and strawberry shortcake.  Just sat down inside for the first time and service was also great.  Had coffee and a slice of cheesecake with friends. Friends got muffins which they said were giant and delicious.

I was on the mission searching for the best tiramisu there is in the city.  So stop by here at night.  Super easy to find a parking in the area which is a huge plus.  I bought a hot latte, tres leches, and ofcourse the tiramisu to go.  Tres Leches was alright.  Latte was spot on, might actually go there for the latte again.  The tiramisu, where do i start.  In short, it was bad.  That was my main reason there and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment of the night.  I'm not a fans of having lady fingers on tiramisu.  Usually its the first sign of showing they're arent good at making it.   The tiramisu wasn't fresh at all, I'm not sure how long they been sitting there and it was unnecessarily sweet.  Overall, it was an okay experience.", "author": "Feng C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-29", "description": "At the time of writing this review it is a three month old bakery in the neighborhood. They have a diverse selection of cakes and other pastries. Presentation is also very intricate, all of the deserts look delicious! I tried a piece of salted caramel cake. You could taste how fresh and fluffy it was. I also ordered a coffee cake and a coffee. Coffee cake was huge! It was very tasty and fresh as well. The coffee was pretty good too. The only downside, they mix the milk and sugar for the coffee for you which I didn't quite like. I like to add the milk to my coffee myself as I know how diluted I'd like it to be. \n\nThey also have lots of tables and chairs inside and a good size patio outside. I would definitely come back again and also thinking about ordering a birthday cake from here. They can make any cake from their selection at a reasonable price, 7 inch cake for $29. The best part is that if you aren't sure which cake you want, you could just buy a few slices to try and order the entire cake for the one you like.", "author": "Nara A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-23", "description": "I love this place! My sister and I are in here at least three times a month and we can't wait for our friends birthdays, we always purchase a birthday cake from here.

There's a huge variety of sweets, amazing service that endulges my 3 year old in every way, and a really nice outdoor space in the back.
