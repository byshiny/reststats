Cheese. It was not bad for a Saturday and a birthday party going on. The three stars came from 1. They do not let your child/ren under 18 out of the facility unless an adult okays it. 2. They were staff constantly cleaning up. 3. The staff and customer service was helpful. BUT, half the games did not work and have the ticket counters were not working either. For a busy place like this with a lot of kids this was not acceptable. Also they are under staffed. It took me about 20-30 minutes just to get to the counter to pick a toy. On a bust Saturday there should be at least 5 people behind the counter ESPECIALLY when the facility is hosting a birthday party.", "author": "Alania A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-12-01", "description": "went on 12/01 please do yourself a favor and avoid this place nothing positive can be said management should be ashamed the way this location is runned", "author": "Jose R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-13", "description": "My kids loved this place. But I realized one IMPORTANT thing about Chucky Cheese that if you don't come here with coupons you get REALLY ripped off. I overpaid for my tokens while another group paid next to nothing because they came prepared with coupons on their phone. The games are great. The food is ok. The pizza crust is so tasteless it reminds me of Matzah. Drink refills are free which is nice. I expected it to be more noisy than it was. But really the noise wasn't too bad..

This is only our second time at this location and it's not too bad.  It has changed since the first time we were there. There used to be a big overhead tunnel maze for the kids to play in and a slide right in the center of the place. When we returned the second time it was gone and I was glad about that. It was just a mad house and not good for the smaller kids which of course mad the smaller kids want to go in even more. But it's gone and they have re arranged and spread out all the other games. Makes it seem like there aren't that many things to do but your kids will find things. \n\nYou will be exhausted from moving all over the place bouncing from game to game. \n\nYou will be frustrated when you get to some of the game and they are out of order \n\nYou will be a little annoyed when the games that are working take your tokens and then you have to hunt the employee, whose job it is to try to fix said game and refund you back any tokens you lost. \n\nYou will have to keep an eye on your kids and their tokens and their tickets because some seedy child will try to swipe if not monitored. They will also try to jump right in front of your child in lieu of waiting their turn. \n\nFood is kid approved. I think they've recently revamped their menu to be more parent friendly\n\nBathrooms have mini toilets for kids and normal size for adults.

I used to do homeless outreach for a non-profit, and I have seen homeless folks living in a train tunnel have a better variety of food available than this ridiculous excuse for a buffet.\n\nIt's described as an all-you-can-eat pizza and salad buffet.

HANDS DOWN WORST EXPERIENCE. I WILL NOT RETURN!!!\n\nI will not recommend the Atlantic Mall location in Brooklyn to ANYONE due to the worst experience one could have with his or her children. the issues as follows:\n\n-the tables weren't clean , so we had to clean it ourselves\n-either the rides were not working or broken (eating the token or not giving you tickets). How is it possible for the maze to be out of service? not even Mcdonalds maze is out of service.\n- photo booth that takes crappy pictures with a weird line in the middle of each picture.\n-fountain drink machine missing ICE with need of cleaning\n-staff members who wear pants under their bottoms flashing the children their non name brand undies\n-security guards who asked for patrons to get off the ride because it was near closing time, shouting the countdown of when the place closes\n\n\nI would expect for those who are hired to have a sense of customer service and are able to articulate themselves properly. My experience goes as follows; the staffs were beyond unprofessional. There is nothing wrong with a team of young staff members to relate to the children however I blame management for not training these individuals properly. I literally had to retrieve a staff member to refill the soft drink machine with ICE. As I requested ICE the staff member rolls his eyes and looks at me with a blank stare for 10 seconds seemingly bothered by the request. You would think I ordered porter house steak with such a stare. No way a customer should have to inform staff there's no ice available and have staff say, \" do you need ICE right now.\" let alone staff who rolls their eyes at such a small request that was paid for by the customer. \n\nThe tone that the cashiers and other workers use around children is not appropriate. My children are not use to hearing curse words in their household let alone at an establishment that was not free. As a minority it hurts me to see the staff members represent themselves and the establishment in such a bad light. The workers are in need of diversity training and/or other trainings for a conducive workplace. \n\nThe security guards were just as bad as the other workers. I understand customers have to be reminded of the amount of time left till closing (which was repeated every minute by two guards from 10:55 until 11:00pm) however having to explain to a security guard that one child is feeding the ticket machine and the other is still on the ride. The security with a nasty tone requested for me to take my child off the ride.

The first time I was here (November 2015), half of the games were broken and the food took an hour to arrive, so I was pretty bored due to that. Not only that, but most of the toilets in the bathroom were child-sized, and only 3 or 4 were adult sized. Imagine having to squat over that with a full bladder-no fun! My second visit to this location was an improvement. The games were working this time, and the pizza came out in 20 minutes. They still had the awfully small toilets, but it's better than waiting in a looong line at Barclay's Center after Disney on Ice ends! So, all in all, it depends on the time of day you go there.

Parents let their children run around unsupervised and then want to scream and disciple the child loudly because they couldn't find them. This made no sense whatsoever. On top of unsupervised children and loud parents my son and myself were literally followed around the game section by a group of three little boys. First they asked me for my tokens. Of course I told them no. So instead of them asking their parents for money they followed us and waited for us to play a game then jumped in and tried to play with us. I didn't mind at first but drew the line at the basketball game (there was only two basketball and four kids trying to share which meant my son got bumped out of his own game). \n\nThe place isn't that clean, the food is overly expensive, the wait for the food is ridiculously long and the prizes are horrible.
