The hostess definitely stole money from the check looking back on it. We gave her $80 in cash and $80 on a credit card. Thinking about it the next day since I was drunk I realized she must've pocketed the extra $30. Since she wrote that we only have 50$ in cash on the bill. Stupid me was too out of it to notice.  Now checking my credit card bill I see I was charged another 25$ on top of the $80 I put down. Get rid of this hostess lady with the big hair.

They have great food. The service is good and they won't bother you to leave. \n\nThe only drawback for dinner is it can get pretty noisy, so it is not the best place for a date or business dinner where you would be talking to someone. It works perfect for me, I use it as my kitchen away from home to grab a quick bite when working from home, so I am usually alone and bring a book. \n\nLunch time and brunch are not as noisy and often peaceful.\n\nI have lived in the area and been going here for many years, since they opened. The atmosphere is New York eclectic, reflecting the history of the neighborhood when artists used to be the majority of people living there. \n\nMy favorite is the pork chop dinner. It is a nice size portion and delicious! For the type and quality of food they serve the price is quite reasonable.", "author": "Anna H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-20", "description": "\"Wow\" is all I can say with regard to their burger ; The type of \"medium-rare\" goodness that invokes a sense of \"why did I agree to split this with a girl I barely know.\"    \n\nAs each bite inches you closer towards your sealed-fate of empty hands and plates, you wonder if you could use the free-hand to swipe the other half from your counter-parts grip.  But you don't.  Because Superfine is also about remaining...superfriends.\n\nEverything about it was bliss.\n\nThe setting is unassuming, but the lack of a black-tie does not imply a black-eye (see what I did there?) on the well-appointed menu tied together with organic and fresh ingredients. \n\nSimply a must if you are in the area, and with so much to do in the area, it is worthy of the trip.", "author": "Tom O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-19", "description": "Superfine is just that. Fine. Nothing really special. The beer selection is nice, but outside of that, the menu is lacking. They have decent options, but often their bar menu won't have a burger on it. That's just insane to me. Burgers should be a staple of every bar, and I don't think that's too much to ask. The other items on the menu get pretty expensive pretty fast.\n\nThe atmosphere is quite nice, though. It's a very unique space in a nice neighborhood. It's enjoyable if you're going to have a couple drinks, but outside of that, I'll find another place to eat.", "author": "Ross B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-26", "description": "Not bad, not bad at all. I came to Superfine to meet a few people, and was intrigued by the decor. Because I spend so much time in Manhattan, and a bit in Queens, too, I'm always open to being whisked away by Brooklyn charm. I am very into exposed brick, so I liked that, and the bar was cozy and nestled in a separate part of the restaurant, kitty-corner to the dining area. \n\nI had two very strong, very proportionate vodka cranberries. The people I was with had beer, and one had a martini. I know that my friend Bob enjoyed a Coney Island beer, but because of my lack of beer knowledge, that means little to me. He liked it, though, this I know. \n\nWe decided to stay at Superfine for dinner. I was really drawn to the red lentil soup - really good, and couldn't decide between a cavatappi or the mozzarella sandwich. The cavatappi had meat in it, and because I didn't know how they would respond to a substitution, I decided to get the mozzarella sandwich. Delicious. And homemade potato crisps. The second best thing to the food was that we sat right by the kitchen and could smell waves of garlic while watching food be prepared. \n\nI'm new to DUMBO restaurants, but would definitely recommend this location.", "author": "Alexandra K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-26", "description": "Breakfast burrito was the weakest thing I've ever eaten.

Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised. The food and drinks were really good. I had a Costmo which is a more detailed combination of my two favorite drinks, Grey Goose and Cranberry juice. That was very good. I also had the pork chop with mashed potatoes and a cabbage slaw which was delicious. \n\nOverall, Superfine is a cute hidden spot in Dumbo and if you're ever in the area, definitely stop by!\n\nPlease visit my blog http://simplypamarie.com/2013/08/28/superfine/ for further details and great pictures!", "author": "Pamela G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-26", "description": "Don't sit near the pool table.

I love the live music and the bands! We were there last Sunday for brunch. We walked up the ramp but there was no hostess stationed there. We waited and there were other servers around who were walking by us and saw us waiting but didn't say anything. They could have told us that \"Someone will be with you shortly...\" but no they just ignored us. \n\nThe food was ok. It was on the expensive side and small portions. I ordered the fish tacos and they only had 1 corn tortilla vs. the traditional 2 layered corn tortilla taco so by the time it got to me and i picked it up the taco fell apart. It was all soggy.
