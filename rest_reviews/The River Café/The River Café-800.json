Like me, LOL. \nDinner was sublime. There was some breed of Hungarian pig braised in Barolo for 12 hours as an appetizer special, and it was rich and tender. My foie gras two ways, paired with a glass of Sauternes, combined sweet and savory and crunchy and unctuous in each fantastic mouthful. My duck was crispy on the outside and incredibly meaty on the inside, and Joe's butter poached lobster was tender and wonderfully way to eat, a big plus when you're in nice clothes and not at a lobster shack in Maine. Joe's black and white soda for dessert came with an amazing chocolate cake and a little Brooklyn bridge made of chocolate. Superadorable! \nThere are like I said aspects of the service, particularly in the getting-to-the-table part of the meal, that are a little too impersonal, but our server was an absolute doll and was warm and friendly.    \nIt was a wonderful choice and I had a delightful evening.", "author": "Elizabeth B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-05", "description": "The great:\n- Amazing view from every seat in the house\n- Very attentive staff\n- Excellent menu\n- Lots of little touches\n- $98 fixed price is a steal\n\nThe just-okay:\n- Ordered the lobster, tasted a little undercooked\n- B/c it was a little off the main road and I was in heels, we asked the doorguy to call us a cab, which I figured consisted of turning on the light outside that said \"taxi\" - he ended up calling us a black car, which actually was not terribly unreasonable but still not what we wanted", "author": "Pam C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-29", "description": "What a special experience.

Came here for a celebration dinner with my boyfriend and loved everything about our experience, from the food, to the view, to the service (for the money you pay here, you better love everything). I'm not going to get into individual dishes because I'm pretty sure the chef can't screw up too badly but I do recommend that you order the Brooklyn Bridge dessert to top everything off.

No jacket required.  We did not make reservations.\n\n$55 fixed menu.  We got an appetizer and entree each with the $55.  Not bad. \n\nThe place is adorable outside and inside!  Really nice atmosphere.  Service is impeccable.  Great place for a special occasion. \n\nI ordered the Butterleaf salad.  Second best salad I ever had in my life.  Light, great portion size (not too big as to ruin an appetite).  Very very fresh ingredients.  My husband had the seafood trio appetizer.  Equally pleased.  He loved it.  Fish was super fresh.\n\nFor entree I ordered the Amish Chicken.  Not happy.  It was a bit on the dry side, and the chicken was wrapped in what seemed like a roll of chicken skin that was all fat and not crispy. The caramelized onions it was served with were a pleasure!  Very good! Not enough of them! It had a pea sauce that I didn't care for.  It was a strange dish.  \n\nMy husband had the Ranch steak which was very very good.  \n\nI would go back but not often as the menu is mostly seafood and I dont eat fish, so for me it would be hard to find something different to try on the menu as they only have one chicken, and one steak dish on their menu.", "author": "Melissa C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-11", "description": "I would give this place 4 or 5 stars based on attending a wedding there last year if not for my current experience:\n\nHaving really liked the restaurant, I made a somewhat last minute decision to order a gift certificate for my friends as a wedding gift. I am from San Francisco and wanted to put the certificate in a nice card before getting it to my friends. So, knowing the timing was tight I called and spoke to a young woman on Tuesday evening and asked if they could process my request and mail out the certificate ASAP so it would arrive by that Saturday to a NY address where I was staying. She didn't think that would be a problem.\n\nI faxed the request form on Wed morning with a cover letter emphasizing that I needed this certificate to arrive by Saturday (or else I would no longer be at that address) and asked that someone call me if that is not possible.\n\nI heard nothing until I called the restaurant Friday afternoon and, after some time, received a call back from the manager that processed the request. He casually said \"Oh, it went out Thursday morning I think. It should get there tomorrow or the day after\". Day after being - MONDAY.\n\nNeedless to say the certificate never arrived, I had to leave a forwarding address with the people I stayed with, and I had nothing to give to my friends. Quite disappointed by the customer service. I would have appreciated a call letting me know that they may not get it out in time so I could have saved everyone the hassle.", "author": "Anya S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-02", "description": "Spectacular setting and view.  Prix Fixe ($115 per person) was very expensive but I guess you have to pay for the view.  There was too much food overall, although it was all very good.

If it had a dinner menu, that would have been amazing because there is a great view of Manhattan from River Cafe.  \nThe portions were relatively small, especially the appetizers.  The crispy duck breast was very tasty, but the wild boar and pasta wasn't too special.  Being able to have three desserts was a plus!  However, the dark chocolate Marquise cake wasn't as good as the creme brulee and strawberry ice cream.  \nIf you get a chance to, you should go here at least one time at night.

While the food absolutely knocked it out of the park, the service was unbelievably bad.  I will spare everyone the details, but I will say that i was more than appalled.  To the restaurant's defense, it was an incredibly packed night due to fireworks (fleet week i believe) and the exceptional view of the river/city.\n\nBut after a chat with the manager and giving the restaurant a second chance (I knew a restaurant with food THAT good couldn't possibly have service THAT bad) i have definitely come around.  The second time around the service was great and food was just as good.  the oysters were delicious, even though i normally hate oysters.  i think a restaurant is truely on a different level when they can make the foods you hate taste great.\n\nSo overall 4 stars for the amazing food, good service (second time around) and breathtaking views.", "author": "Lisa P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-05", "description": "It was a cold night in november 2008 when I was invited by my boyfriend to have dinner and celebrate my 21st birthday.
