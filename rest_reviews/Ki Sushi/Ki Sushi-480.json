Note that I only ordered for delivery.\n\nThey have a nice selection - nothing earth shattering but was in the mood for some basic sashimi and sushi with the beau.  Very nice on the phone.\n\nI ordered the Sashimi Regular and he ordered spicy tuna rolls, dumplings and edamame\n\nThey delivered very quickly which is a nice thing in the area.\n\nThe presentation was beautiful - and everything looked fresh and delicious.  It was another story when I started to eat my meal.  I was greatly disappointed.  Both of our meals were very bland and my sashimi was tough.  The fish was fresh and it was not bad but it was... blah.  blech almost.\n\nThe only thing that I ate was the rice, miso soup and edamame.  A very expensive meal that I had to throw away.\n\nSorry to say I won't be trying them again.  ...and I was really in the mood for such good sushi.  *sigh*", "author": "nycsep n."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-21", "description": "Pretty damn good.

Too much of the \"spicy sauce\" (some seasoned mayo tasting thing - this sauce appears in many dishes it seems).\n\nI had the Dynamite roll based on other's recommendations - wasnt really impressed, it was kind of falling apart. I really liked the jalapeno tobiko on top! \n\nEel and Avocado was really good- i had stopped ordering eel and avocado for awhile because of some chewy pieces I had at other restaurants in bk. basic but i have had it go wrong at places like Kiku and Taro. \n\nI would like to go back to try nigiri sushi instead of rolls.\nFish was fresh - but i wasnt like omg this is the best ever.", "author": "Sharon K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-12", "description": "Delicious buuuut I wouldn't trust the freshness based on my experience with the Ikura.

(I promise to amend this review should that change.)  Honestly, I haven't had particularly good sushi in Brooklyn, so let me start again.\n\nKi has great sushi.  Also it's in Brooklyn.  Since discovering it last week I've eaten there three times.  The sushi is quality.  The service is top notch.  I can't get enough of the mushroom soup.  The standard Japanese green salad with citrus dressing tastes much better than the standard Japanese green salad with citrus dressing.\n\nMost importantly, the Scottish grilled salmon entree is perhaps the best thing that ever happened to a fillet of salmon.\n\nAlso, 2 times out of 3 I wasn't pressed to leave immediately after my meal.  I was able to sit back and enjoy another cup of green tea.  My server did me the courtesy of not bringing the check until I asked for it.  I love that.", "author": "lee v."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-19", "description": "We were SO happy that we chose this spot over all the other possibilities in the hood. Since hurricane Hanna was spending some time in Brooklyn the night we went, wherever we ended up had to be worth the sloshing around the hood. Clearly since all the other maniacs were home, hiding from the rain, we can't attest to the normal wait time. We waltzed in, left a big puddle on the floor and were ready to go.

A fried, soggy, too sweet mess.  Almost impossible to eat with chopsticks.  No taste of miso at all.  Compared to the same thing at Blue Ribbon Sushi (which is divine) this is a disappointment.  \n\nI got the Special Omakase, apparently from Tokyo.  I'm not sure what was actually from Japan, but I can tell you this: it is as good as sushi gets - anywhere in the world.  The chef prepared a perfect mix of taste, texture, appearance, and color.  The plate itself is a beauty to behold.  The flavors vary from very light and sweet - and deliciously succulent, to powerfully rich packed with of flavor.  Each piece was so distinct from the next.  You really had to savor each bite.  If you follow the right order - each piece will build on the next.  One of the pieces was scarred, blow torched, and salted and was amazing.  The grand finale was the Uni from Hokkaido.  I am not a uni guy but this was *the* best I've ever had.  It almost has the texture of foam, yet was full of rich umami flavor.  Total knockout.  Everyone has to try the sushi at least once - especially if you think you don't like nigiri sushi.

I have been here 3 or 4 times, had several different rolls and apps, and it's always been wonderful!\nI personally love their seaweed salad and the boyfriend always gets the seafood soup that is seriously a meal unto itself - the thing is stuffed with mussles, shrimp, white fish...etc.\nMy roommate gets their takeout a lot, and they are always really quick and never mess up her specialty order.  \n\nCool atmosphere (altho small inside) and quick service top off this great restaurant!  \n\nI also love how the sushi chefs always say hi to you!

The food was \"delish\" and I made a point of trying dishes I had never had before. \n\nTo start off I had the cold Nigori Sake which I liked very much since I never had Sake before.

And that's all I could handle...I was fulll.\n\nOur waiter was pleasant but the food was brought out in a rather sporadic manner which annoyed a few of my friends. Either he was new, wasn't used to serving groups, or was just disorganized.

My husband and I found the experience to be rushed, extremely overpriced, and ultimately unsatisfying. \n\nWe ordered the salmon skin salad and the TNT roll as appetizers and they were inventive and yummy.\n\nHowever, for our main course, we ordered \"Omakase.\" By definition, omakase should be the equivalent of a chef's special. The chef is supposed to be innovative and surprising using a selection of high quality fish to create something memorable for his guests. Often omakase includes different courses. \n\nFor our omakase, we were brought 8 pairs of nigiri!!! The selection included standard fair such as salmon, mackerel, yellow tail, and eel, the only \"exotic\" piece being the toro fatty tuna. Some pieces had a hefty dose of wasabi underneath so that we couldn't even taste the fish. We were scraping wasabi off the fish in order to taste it.\n\nOur final bill with two drinks each came to $110!! \n\nWith all the creative things listed on the menu, I was shocked that the chef did not take the time to make our experience memorable and that the wait staff didn't bat an eye either.", "author": "Joanna W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-29", "description": "I typically get their take out, which is a bit more expensive than the other sushi joints in Cobble Hill but their quality is also a bit better.

This is not the place to get intimate as the people next to you will hear everything you say. It will only come in handy because the stranger sitting next to you will be able to hear you apologize when you inevitably bump into them.\n\noverall: I'd go back again and take whoever wanted to come with me.
