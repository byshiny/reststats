I was impressed by how many choices there were on the Restaurant Week menu (and the great price). I chose a salad to start and the steak frites. It was all very delicious.

If you like dijon mustard soup, then order the muscles and french fries.

I came on a Wednesday and luckily had reserved a table - unlike the many people turned away at the door. There is a small but well appointed bar at the front where you can wait for your friend/date with an expertly mixed drink and a narrow jewel box of a restaurant with an airy back patio. The interior is reminiscent of a French bistro with narrow tables and mirrors but updated in a modern white. \n\nNow on to food! We started with a selection of briny east and west coast oysters - they were tasty but we were told the east coasters were from two different places, which was confusing - I also didn't like that the ice was melting so much that the oysters were capsizing! Next we tried the snug harbor greens - a simple green salad well dressed. Finally, we shared mussels and an order of fries. The mussels had merguez in them, making them very rich and the fries were thin \u0026 crispy as I like them. \n\nAll of the food was really high quality and prepared with expertise. It's also useful to note there are several vegetarian options on the menu as well as steaks so you can suit most tastes here! Downsides are few, but it's quite expensive, we felt a bit rushed, and it's a small space. \n\nOverall, a delicious and well done meal!", "author": "Heidi C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-31", "description": "Perhaps you've heard of a popular eatery called Buttermilk Channel? No? Well, it's THE brunch place in the area, but some people like me were getting too lazy to walk all the way down there. Thankfully, it's like the owners heard my thoughts, and opened up a spot less than a somersault away from my apartment. Yay!\n\nThere's nothing to complain about here, expect the smidge of a wait on weekends for brunch. But otherwise, it's all gravy (and biscuits)! There's your typical heavy French options, with lighter fare as well, and A+ drinks to ease you into whatever kind of meal you wanna have. For example, I could chow down on some steak frites if I'm hungover, or have a fluffy scramble with sparkling water post-yoga. \n\nFood is great and perfectly portioned. Servers are sweethearts. Also...the atmosphere is adorable. Great for a cozy winter night in.", "author": "Sarah G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-18", "description": "I've been to French Louie 3 times - once in 2014 for wine \u0026 steak- cooked to perfection, paired with a red so delicious that I still remember it 4 years later. Twice for a drink with my friend at the bar, and third for my birthday dinner last night.\n\nThe entire experience was phenomenal - the staff knows how to give you a prime birthday experience. Mack (the FOH manager) and our server were attentive to me \u0026 my guests by constantly refilling our glasses of bubbly \u0026 water, pairing blood orange sorbet with our store-bought cheesecake, and letting us linger after our meal for a bit to digest.\n\nFood - \n1. Smoked sardines - I loved sardines from a can as a kid, but haven't had them since my elementary school graduation. These are adult sardines - huge chunks of fish to go with crusty bread and some fragrant butter.\n2. Anchovy fritters - Holy shit, the crusty lemon they serve these with blew me away. I didn't even know I could eat a lemon whole. I wish there was more fried lemon. As for the anchovies, they were good too. But something about that lemon added a bit of je ne sais quoi to the dish.\n3. Mussels - These were finger-licking good. I hate people that slurp at the table, but I couldn't help myself this time. Don't waste a single bit of the sauce that covers the mussels - they give you some delicious apple butter toast to prevent this sacrilege. \n4. Seared foie gras - The star of the show. We ordered two. One for the table and another as my friend's main course. It's tiny, but don't let the size fool you - it's essentially an animal's fatty liver disease, so it's rich enough to not need more of it. But I wanted more. My friend was onto something when she ordered it for her main course. Can't stop thinking about the spice cake \u0026 huckleberry jam it came with - everything about the salty/fatty/sweetness of it is gonna follow me for the rest of my life.\n5. Duck Au Poivre - Damn. The peppered crust. The portion alone is impressive, don't let the pictures on Yelp fool you. Just get it, trust me. \n6. Blood orange sherbert - They were onto something with this seasonal treat. Went amazingly with our plain Junior's cheesecake. I'd love to come back and try their other offerings!\n\nIn conclusion, 100/10 experience, go wine \u0026 dine in ambiance \u0026 hospitality.", "author": "Anna N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-13", "description": "ALWAYS A DELIGHT!\nWe've dined here many of times and it is always excellent!

The restaurant was packed on a snowy Friday evening buy the service was remarkably relaxed and friendly. They have a nice cocktail menu and a good selection of wines and beers (try the sour ale)!\n\nAppetizers: the butternut squash soup was fine but the mussels were outstanding. This is a GIANT bowl of seafood and the mussels themselves were plump and juicy. The mustard cream sauce they were served in was excellent.\n\nEntrees: the steak frites was a large, filling portion and the steak was nicely cooked. What really made this dish shine, however, was the incredible house steak sauce. Make sure to ask the waiter for this! The trout entree was also nice and the bread salad it was served on top of was very flavorful.\n\nDessert: the cheese was okay but the profiteroles were a better choice. These little morsels were drenched in a caramel cardamom sauce and were a great way to end a lovely meal.", "author": "Sol C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-09", "description": "Backyard is great, perfect for summer.  Service was solid.  The food just wasn't great with exception of escargot.  Smoked mackerel had no smoke taste. Lamb was pretty fatty (fries were great).  And snap pea salad ($15 by the way) had basically vines in it. They gave us a steak knife.  For the salad.  \"I've never had to fight my salad,\" my wife said.

The menu is pretty small, so we didn't go crazy, but the choices are strong:\n\n- Chocolate-Almond Brioche ($4)\nThis was a really excellent pastry to begin the meal with. Served nice and hot, it was so buttery and much more chocolatey than these breads usually are. Make sure you start with this for a very satisfying appetizer.\n\n- Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e French Toast ($12)\nThis is a great idea - the crackly, crispy texture of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e on the outside and the smooth, whipped interior go together very nicely. Maybe slightly too eggy, as the inside was borderline liquid smooth, and it barely resembled toast, but it was still tasty.\n\n- Thick-cut Bacon ($6 for 3 strips)\nVery thick indeed, this was an excellent plate of bacon that provided some much needed meat to complement the sweet of the french toast.\n\n- Burger Royale ($17)\nNot a fancy pants burger, but rather a very fancy Big Mac. The thin patty might have you concerned at first, until you realize there are two of them. It turns out that this was one of the best burgers I've had recently. The meat was shockingly juicy considering how thin the patties were, and the bun was nice and soft. Not only that, but the fries were excellent too - very crispy and well-salted, making you wish there were more. Make sure you come for brunch so you get to try this burger.\n\nI would have liked to try some dessert, but I'm not sure if there was anything as we were not offered any. Other than that, service throughout was good. Definitely make sure you request a seat out back when it's nice out. The food was good enough that I definitely wouldn't mind returning to check out the dinner menu.", "author": "Mike C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-28", "description": "I came here with my cousin for Jan/Feb 2016 Restaurant Week (lunch)- I ordered the Steak Tartare (egg yolk, chile oil, and pickled mustard seed), salad ni\u00e7oise socca (chickpea flatbread, rare tuna, olive aioli, soft boiled egg, and salad greens), and the profiteroles (vanilla ice cream and cardamom caramel). My cousin ordered the snug harbor greens (banyuls vinaigrette and torn herbs), grilled trout po'boy (remoulade, red cabbage and fennel slaw on a sourdough baguette), and the profiteroles (vanilla ice cream and cardamom caramel). \n\nAfter studying through the RW menu, reading countless Yelp reviews, and sifting through delicious photos of food, I was thoroughly convinced that I would have to try this place. Everything on their RW menu looked very appetizing and I had a difficult time choosing what I wanted for my first and second course. The third course however was going to be an easy one. You have a choice between the profiteroles or something called \"Nancy's Camembert\" (rye ficelle, huckleberry jam and endive), which hands-down I was definitely going to choose the profiteroles. \n\nAs for the first and second course, I thought the best thing to do would be to just order whatever would normally come out to be the most expensive, as I would maximize on my savings. Honestly, had I gone with that strategy then I would've ordered the steak tartare and the moules frites. However, for some reason, I decided to get the salad ni\u00e7oise socca which turned out to be the worst mistake. At the time that I arrived at the restaurant, I skimmed around the dining room to see what the other patrons were ordering. Two women sitting next to me had ordered the salad ni\u00e7oise socca. It looked appetizing, and on the normal lunch menu the salad would've been a pricey $16. \n\nI started off with the steak tartare, and it was good. I wish; however, that they served the plate with a few more pieces of toast. As other people started on their second courses, I saw how delicious the po'boy trout looked as it was coming out of the kitchen. The moules frites looked even better. At that point, the salad ni\u00e7oise socca looked like rabbit food, and I was becoming regretful. It was too late to change my order. The second course arrives at our table and I immediately made a sad face. Thankfully, my cousin gave me a piece of her trout po'boy because the salad ni\u00e7oise socca was not good. I didn't even take a photo of the salad because I was so disappointed with the dish. There were 3 small pieces of rare tuna. Most of the mixed greens were rotten (on that note: my cousin ordered the snug harbor greens for her first course and most of the mixed greens in that dish were also rotten). The chickpea flatbread as it was placed under the salad had been soggy. This is possibly the worst dish a person could order. They should not include this on their RW menu if they really want to showcase their best dishes and have people come back (because isn't that really the purpose of participating in RW)? Had I not been able to taste the trout po'boy, I probably wouldn't have rated this restaurant has high as I did, and I probably wouldn't have come back. The trout po'boy really saved it. I would definitely still come back for the trout po'boy or for some of the other dishes that I didn't get to try.", "author": "James W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-10", "description": "I be been here a few times before and it has always been good.
