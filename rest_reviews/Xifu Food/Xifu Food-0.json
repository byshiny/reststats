It's beyond affordable, and the buns are top notch.\n\nI'd even venture to say they do it better than Xi'an. What little pretension Xi'an's accumulated over the years is completely absent at Xifu.\n\nIt's basically a hole in the wall that's been given a nice coat of paint. Super barebones with a staggeringly cheap menu that has all the stuff you'd expect from a super casual joint in the seedier parts of Chinatown. You've got your dumplings, your soups, your noodles. And they take credit cards! Though you get a discount with cash.\n\nImagine Yaso Tangbao, but like... 200% cheaper. And a bit greasier.\n\nTheir \"rougamo\" buns are delicious. Never heard the term before, but it's basically like regular bao, but sightly grilled/pressed. I got the stewed pork one, and it was worth the price of admission. Only $4, but you would spend way more for a bun of similar quality elsewhere.\n\nAlso got an order of boiled dumplings in spicy \u0026 sour soup. \"Soup\" is kind of generous, as it was just a step above chili oil. But so delicious. Heartburn-inducing, but delicious. Came $12 to an order for just $6!!!\n\nCouldn't leave without a hot and sour soup (my favorite). It could've used a bit more red vinegar, but all the component parts where there - the bamboo shoots, the fungus, etc. Pretty solid.\n\nStaff was friendly, and there's a few tables inside. They're open til 8:30 on weekdays, so a good post-gym dinner.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty sure this is going to be my new cheap eats neighborhood spot. Especially since Ganso recently closed, and other places are a bit too \"fancy\" when I'm just trying to indiscriminately stuff my face with food.", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-15", "description": "Yummy cheap affordable food. \n\n6 dumplings of your choice (chicken, pork, veggies) for $2.

Dumplings. \n\nIts is ALWAYS packed in here. \n\nSo be prepared to wait . And I mean wait ! \n\nI used to spend my entire lunch break (30mins) waiting for my food.

Perhaps intentionally derivative of Vanessa's Dumplings and/or Xian Famous Foods. Portions are large, and although prices are a dollar or two more now than they were a month ago, good for them making a profit, because what they charge is still more than reasonable for what you get. It's simple food, really. Salty not sugary, oily not greasy, sauces are definitely watered down, but there's still plenty of white pepper and Sichuan peppercorn to legitimately excite the palette. Dumpling dough is thick, noodles are thick, nothing is pristine or sublime, but, again, this is cheap food, and it's fast food, it's basically perfect for my needs: $10 for two plates to be stuffed, before shows at BAM; no need to suffer through any of the mediocre high-priced bland cutesy places in the neighborhood.", "author": "David L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-27", "description": "This place is so inexpensive it's insane!

Instead I found the meal to be pretty underwhelming. The dough in the vegetarian dumplings was too thick for my liking and didn't really stand out. I ordered the chef special of the day which was eggs and tomatoes over rice or noodles. I opted for the noodles and was disappointed. They were bland and cold, topped with a plain tomato omelette. No sauce, no flavor. I wouldn't order this dish again. My husband did really like his stewed beef rougamo.
