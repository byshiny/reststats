And that is completely true.  The pizza was plain and hyped that we went in with such expectations that we ended up saying 'mehh; not worth it'.  The cheese had no flavor, the sauce probably bought from a ready to go container.  We asked for extra toppings among them garlic.  It appeared the chef preparing our pizza dumped all the garlic in one area.  So much hype for so little flavor; total disappointment.\n\nVariety of food choices can be a negative at this place.  My friend asked for a simple salad, NO.  They do not have any.  What about sandwiches with different type of bread? NO.\n\nAlso, this establishment needs a lot of work.  It is falling apart and customers (at least my two friends and I) get the feeling that the restaurant owners are not interested in repairing simple things such as wobbly tables or bathroom faucets.  The faucets were made to work by adding pieces of rough metal with edges that can cut the skin of the hands.  Owners did not bother to replace them with standard handles.  That and don't overlook the dust that is burgeoning all over the place.  It appears that cleaning does not get a high priority on the managers list.\n\nOverall, if one has to do an extra effort to visit a place such this pizzeria, he or she should be happy to talk about it and the experience afterwards.  Obviously that is not at all my case.", "author": "David C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-05", "description": "The two stars is for the food.

I saw this place and I wanted to give it a try. The lines were incredibly long but I thought if the lines are this long, it has to be good. Before I was going to eat here, I checked the menu to see if they made gluten free pies. It didn't say anything on the menu so I asked the host. Instead of getting a response of \"No, we don't have gluten-free pies, sorry for the inconvenience,\" or something like that, I got a response like this from an unhappy and rude older man(host), \"What do you mean, gluten-free pies, we don't serve that trash, we serve real pizza,\" I was in shock that this man said this and people around me that heard this as well were stunned. The best part is as I was about to leave, the same guy says to a family of three, \"You three people, with the baby, this isn't a park so either leave your stroller outside and come in or you can eat outside,\" Right then the mother was furious and she started yelling at the man for being extremely rude and he completely ignored her and walked away. After seeing and hearing this a bunch of people left and all saying \"I will never come here again,\" \n I will never come back to this place, and someone should really put that man into a manner class. The old man(host) was almost beat up by some pissed off spanish guy with his family. He told the host he was the biggest jerk off he's ever met. LOL.

Was it delicious? Heck yes. I was actually pleasantly surprised. My expectations were already high, so I was praying my dreams of the deliciousness wouldn't be shot down. My friend and I ordered a large ($18) pie that was half regular and half white (YES, you can do halfsies) then also added some pepperoni and sausage to give it some meat. \n\nThis pizza was love at first bite. In fact, we finished the large! Perfect thickness and easy to hold. The pie itself has just the right amount of toppings except the cheese (hence the half star deduction) - not enough for me!

BUT... tonight I had to write a review about my experience at Grimaldi's Pizzaria in Dumbo, Brooklyn. \n\nSo I walked in at 8pm to ask if they deliver (I live nearby). The host laughed and said no. Ok, don't know why he needed to laugh -- pizzarias often deliver right? -- but whatever. So then I asked where I could order. He showed me to a man who was furiously dealing with orders. I asked if I could order and he grabbed a pen and pad and just looked at me. No smile, no how can I help, nothing OK, it would have been nice, but whatever. So I ordered a large pizza with sausage and green peppers. And a couple of cokes. He said it would be 30 minutes. I asked if I should pay now. He told me $31. I paid cash. I asked if he needed my name, since he didn't ask or give me a receipt or anything at that point. He said no names, and produced an old movie theater-like ticket and wrote down 205 on it. He said they generate random numbers. Ok, not sure how that is easier, but whatever. I went outside, made a couple of phone calls, came back 30 minutes later. \n\nThat's where the fun began! \n\nI produced my ticket and told the host I was here to pick up my pizza. '\n\n'What did you order,' he asked. '\n\nA large sausage and green peppers,' I said. \n\nThe guy who took my order now jumped in: 'I told you red peppers. We don't have green peppers.' \n\nSo I said 'No you didn't tell me that.' \n\nNow the host jumped in: 'I told you to look at the menu before ordering.' \n\nMe: 'No you didn't tell me that either.' \n\nI said 'Look, I own a business as well --' and before I could even finish my sentence -- that mistakes happen but that the business should listen to the customer before blaming them -- the guy who took my order became aggressive and said: 'You own a business? Well I'm the owner here. And I don't want your business. I don't like your attitude.' '\n\n'My attitude,' I said? I couldn't believe this. 'I came in to collect my pizza -- a sausage and green pepper pizza which I ordered from you and paid you for -- and now you tell me you had told me you only have red peppers, which you didn't. And your host's defense was that he told me to look at the menu first, which he didn't!' \n\nAt this point the owner slams $25 in cash back on the counter and says 'Take your money! I don't want to serve you!'\n\nI was shocked. But at this point I was hungry and had just waited 35 minutes. So I figured I would suck it up just to get my dinner. So I said 'It's fine -- then I'll take the sausage and red peppers, no problem.' \n\nAnd this is why I am now writing the review. The owner looks and me and pauses and says 'Apologize and I'll give you the pizza.' \n\nAPOLOGIZE?? \n\nI couldn't believe the sheer brazen arrogance of this guy -- who is the owner! Why would I apologize to this guy when he messed up my order...AND THEN lied that he had told me otherwise...AND THEN refused to give me the wrong pizza anyway unless...I own up to his mistake? That I should be contrite? That I should grovel for forgiveness? What the hell is wrong this guy! But I didn't say any of this. I just told him 'No I won't apologize'. So he pushed the $25 towards me. I said 'It was $31. And you have an attitude problem.'. He said something snarky again about not wanting my business. And I walked out. \n\nSo: here's are my take-aways: \n\n1) Grimaldi's clearly operates in a sellers market and the owner clearly thinks he is an old school guy running and old school business with an old school demeanor where he can get away with being a jerk because there is largely tourist traffic in Dumbo so he doesn't have or need repeat customers any way. But I am not a tourist. I live around the corner. And this was my first time trying to buy a pizza from Grimaldi's. So since I am not some intimidated tourist who might not see the value in calling them out on this but a local who lives and owns a business nearby, I am writing this lengthy review to make sure everyone know how these guys roll. As an owner, I ALWAYS talk to any customers calmly, logically and respectfully, even when they are in the wrong, since we are in the service business and that is what a service business owner should do. This guy was neither calm, logical nor respectful. 1 star. \n\n2) There are no fewer than two other pizza places on the same block: Julianne's and Ignazio's. After this debacle, I went to Ignazio's and ordered a pizza - it was great, they were prompt, no attitude. I hear Julianne's is really good as well. So you might consider those places as alternatives if you don't want to risk running into the same experience I did. \n\n3) Yelp is a pain in the butt when you are a business owner and customers lie or are unfair.

Asked to switch the soda to another kind--he just took the bottle and walked away. Came back with the new drink. No talking. Just handing us stuff as if it was an inconvenience.\n5. Tried to get a water refill and ice cup refill for soda. Bald server looked pissed and walked away and said something under his breath.  Nice, buddy. We can see and hear you.\n6.  Server with arm sleeve tattoo was only paying attention to table near by with young pretty ladies and didn't bother with any other tables.\n7.  Our bill was $27. Decent service would warranted maybe a $4 tip on the low end.  We paid with $40 and wanted change.  They never returned with our change. That's a $13 tip.
