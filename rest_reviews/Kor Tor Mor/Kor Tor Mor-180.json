I ordered the Healthy Tofu Glass Noodle soup that was bland. My fianc\u00e9s Tom Kha soup tasted better. If the meal was on point, a four star would be justified.

Great service and great food, just about as good as it gets. If you love spicy food, this place will challenge how well you can handle the heat. Got to try their Drunken Noodle, it is bangin'.

So I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Good northern Thai food - very clean, not cloying, good flavors and ingredients. If you can't get to Pok Pok, this is a decent runner up - without the long waits! The ambience and decor is also a cut above the usual Thai restaurant - more like a charming cafe - and the staff is very nice. So far the pork larb is my favorite dish.", "author": "alli c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-11-08", "description": "First and last time ordering from this place. Delivery arrived 20 minutes past the Seamless estimate, cold, and missing rice. I called and they said they would have the rice to me in 15-20 minutes. I called back 30 minutes later and it wasn't even out for delivery yet. Food was just OK, not good enough to make up for poor delivery service.", "author": "Melissa C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-24", "description": "had some great reviews, so i stopped by a couple of weeks ago. a solid restaurant with the typical thai dishes. i was hoping for something a bit more unique and regional from the name, but honestly thought it was lacking originality. for example, the drunken noodles with a mix of protein and seafood just does not work and seems like a bizarre choice.", "author": "Wesley H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-01", "description": "Good food, however not every different from all of the countless Thai restaurants in the neighborhood.

The food is great and the menu is diverse with a ton of vegetarian options, the portions are large and filling, and the prices are really reasonable. The airy, dimly lit space is perfect for a casual date night out or a group gathering without breaking the bank. The staff here were also amazing - extremely accommodating, friendly and attentive. They made planning the birthday party so effortless and made sure we were well attended to all night. I'm so happy we chose this restaurant for our dinner party - we will definitely be back!

I was really impressed. My spicy basil fried rice was flavorful, authentic and a real kick in the pants. The tomkha soup was rich and hearty as well. The lunch special was extremely cheap (under $9 not including tip) and it arrived incredibly fast - less than 15 minutes after I placed my order. If you're looking for something fresh, affordable and fast I'd definitely recommend this place.

I accidentally stopped by last week. I had a spicy basil noodle which is my favorite Thai dish. I didn't ask for anything special 'cause I wanted to have a taste of their own style of cooking. Nothing but awesome!!!! I would say. I am definitely going to go back there and try other things.

Decided to try the larb tofu salad after looking up what \"larb salad\" usually is. Looks like it is supposed to be a salad with about equal parts lettuce, rice and meat. I got a container of extremely spicy hot broth with about a pound of tofu and two wilted pieces of lettuce. The onions are in there as promised, but no sign of the \"grounded toasted jasmine rice.\" My fiance's order was correct but his was also extremely spicy, and neither of our dishes were marked with the \"careful, spicy!\" pepper on the menu. The dishes are too spicy for us to eat, and we both usually love medium to hot spicy dishes.", "author": "Kaitlin U."}], "servesCuisine": "Thai", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Kor Tor Mor", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "204 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3nggILUMWgRAPhsYh1La_A/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187975100"}
