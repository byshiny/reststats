Came here the other day for some burgers and fries. After staring at the menu for a bit, I finally decided on the burger of the week, which was Angus burger, with bacon and two type of cheeses on a buttered bun. It definitely tasted as good as it sounded and  the fries were delicious as well. \n\nThe food is little on the expensive side, but for a treat meal, it really is not that bad. My only complaint besides for the long wait time was that they cooked the burger on the very rare side, which was perfect for me, but I think would definitely be a problem for others.", "author": "Jerett G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-05", "description": "Best fries I've ever had from a food truck, hands down.

Both times there was a massive line outside. The food is great. Burger is really high quality (had the Kobe beef). It was cooked a little too pink for my liking, but I was so hungry I look past it. Thankfully I did, because the burger was delicious. A little cold, but I didn't mind. Fries were exceptional too-just the right amount of crispiness. \n\nI'm trying to cut down on eating beef, but Frites 'n' Meats is making it hard, especially with their punchcard. \n\nIf they added a chicken sandwich/burger, that'd be a game-changer.", "author": "Metkel H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-15", "description": "I used to be a vegetarian.  During that time I realized that my absolute favorite food is an awesome burger. Now that I am no longer a veg I try to sample as many burgers as possible in search of the perfect one. Enter Frites \u0026 Meats, home of the $8.50 waygu burger. I got the waygu on potato onion bun with lettuce tomato onion ketchup and onion jam. It was cooked perfectly, tasted buttery and had the perfect char on the bread.  If I could I would eat one every day. Service is polite and quick.

There isn't the excessive topping novelty of, say, a Five Guys' burger, but it's not needed here.  These burgers are merely a vehicle for delivering the flavor and texture of the meat front-and-center.  I've found through trial and error that on this burger, many of the toppings can get quite superfluous.  I tend to like onions and pickles to provide a tangy counterpoint to the meat, but really, even those aren't necessary with this burger.  That this comes from a truck just makes this all the more impressive.\n\nFries are double-fried in the Belgian style.  Probably as a result of this cooking style combined with however these fries are sourced, the end result is the type of fries Burger King's fries try (and usually fail) to be.  As some other reviewers have pointed out, this is not a bad thing at all.  Fry portions, served in a paper cone with a newspaper print in reference to the Belgian origins of fries (frites?) as street food, are extremely large and intended for sharing.  For a few quarters more there is an assortment of aiolis and sauces (mostly mayonnaise-based) available, similar to those you'd get at a Belgian pub -- though the fries are great as they are, but consider trying one of these for the full experience.  You have the rest of your life to dip fries into ketchup.\n\nThe only issue is when I go here, I want both a burger and fries, which means I end up spending more money than I want to get more food than I can eat.  Granted, the fries are quite cheap given the portions as of this writing, and would be fantastic for sharing, but it's still a massive portion for one person.  If this truck offered a smaller individual size offering for fries, it would be perfect.", "author": "Aaron L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-14", "description": "This is, by far, my most favorite burger place. Whenever the truck is nearby I'm definitely there. And it can get a little pricey if you want to throw everything on it, but OMG it's good. \n\nMy fav order: angus on a brioche with goat cheese, mesclun, onion, tomato, bacon and pickles. I usually split an order of fries. The burger is cooked perfectly and goat cheese is oh-so-delicious!\n\nTip: You can order ahead so you don't totally have to wait in line.\n\nTLDR: highly recommended.", "author": "Baramee C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-05", "description": "After dodging this truck several times because of the scary long times, I finally hit it at the right time and decided I had no reason not to give it a go... plus I was really craving a burger!  I was happy to see that regardless of lines, they seem to crank out your food pretty fast. I only waited a few minutes. \n\nIt looked to me like you can choose from pre selected burger combinations or customize your own, which seems to be what most people do here. It's part of the fun!  I stuck with the standard Grass Fed Angus Burger, on a Brioche bun and added Gruyere, savory onion jam, greens, a slice of tomato and mayo.  It was divine. Everything tasted fresh, delicious and of good quality.  They've got a lot of wonderful add-ons and flavors to really take your burger to the next level.  I held off on fries. They seemed pretty ordinary and didn't look like true Belgian Frites as advertised, but I did love the sounds of all the dipping sauces they offer. I should really try em' before knockin' em. \n\nThe best part was the dum dum lollipop they throw in the bag for after. That was a nice touch.

They have tasty eats for a lunch time treat. The cook your meat to the perfect heat; from a truck that must be quite a feat. \n\nTo order you must fill a sheet and spend a fairly long time waiting on your feet. But that's alright because they hands down beat any burger you'd get on the street. Take a bite and you'll be greet by a fantastic flavors you'll want to repeat. The weaker spot would be the frites, but Frites n' Meats should not retreat. \n\nTheir burgers do deserve a seat at the table amongst the elites, but a cut in prices is the one thing I entreat.
