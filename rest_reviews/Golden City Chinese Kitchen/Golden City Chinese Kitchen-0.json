Could have easily given this place three stars, but then I thought about how many times I've used them and what that would say about me - constantly coming back to a three star place. Five stars is out of the question for Chinese take-out, unless they are providing additional escort and drug delivery services. So I'm standing happily by my four-star review. The place delivers so fast I'm typically answering my door to hand the kid money before I'm off the phone with the woman taking my order. Food always hot and generally good .. and have never found any foreign matter mixed in with my chicken and broccoli. And very reasonably priced - you get a whole meal for less than you pay for a pack of Peeps at my local Met. So I'm standing firmly by my chosen Yelp rating on this one .. yay, I am indeed a fan.", "author": "R M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-30", "description": "It's a hole in the wall that tastes like a hole in the wall.
