My friend celebrated her birthday here and it was enjoyable. The restaurant/club/lounge was beautiful and the rooftop part was small but had a great view. \n\nPositives -\n1. Food was really good, a little pricy, but good . Sushi was delicious and the Korean wings were absolutely amazing. \n2. I got a free draft beer when I checked In on yelp. \n3. Multiple bathrooms. Some places hold hundreds of people and have 1 restroom. I believe this place had 3 separate restrooms. \n4. Hookah was good.\n\nNegatives -\n1. Dress code. This restaurant/club/lounge was so pretty but then their were people in there with jeans, sneakers, and I'm pretty sure some of the ladies sitting close to us just came from the gym \u200d. There should be some type of dress code. No jeans and sneakers. \n2. My group had a reservation and we were seated on these long couches with little tables that looked like coffee tables. Our food could barely fit on the tables wand we had to stretch to get the rolls, fries, etc. I ended up putting a small plate in my lap to eat. \n3. My friend paid for valet parking and we waited over 40mins for his car to arrive. Absolutely unacceptable! It was cold and we were standing outside in heels waiting with no idea of when the car was actually coming. \n4. DJ was all over the place. One minute we we're listening to 90's hip hop, then Alternative, then reggae then current hip-hop, then reggaeton. There was absolutely no flow and the charges were abrupt.\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of places in BK and the City that have good food, hookah and a nice decor. I most likely will not be returning to this restaurant/club/lounge.", "author": "Natasha C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-30", "description": "Nice, affordable and chic rooftop in Downtown Brooklyn. The waitress was so cool and friendly and accommodated us in every way possible.\n\nThe food was served faster than I expected, but it was tasty and well presented.\n\nSince I moved recently to Downtown Brooklyn I have been looking for places like Kimoto with a rooftop, a fresh vibe, and a nice view. When I went they had a live DJ playing music for the customers and was super cool.\n\nI recently came back for the Halloween Party and it was amazing! Definitely, Kimoto is a good place to go when you are in Downtown Brooklyn with the desire to have a nice time. The also have a private room for special events that you can reserve for your parties.", "author": "Wendrich J.

And good music. I think they could use some improvement in the customer service department tho. Sat for a while . The bar was not that busy the bartender didn't look my way AT ALL . I had to approach her. Then 45 min goes back before she checks if I would like another SMFH. Not cool", "author": "Tanisha H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-24", "description": "Went here with some friends on a Thursday for after work drinks. Amazing vibes and views. Prices were very reasonable for a rooftop venue. Love it so much that I booked  it for my boyfriend bday celebration. Event manager Jinhee made organizing this event so easy and answered all of my many many questions. Waitress was attentive, DJ was on-point, Great atmosphere with great food. Definitely  my go to hang out spot now. Would highly recommend especially for private events.", "author": "Sasha M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-20", "description": "Went to the restaurant, to try the food. We ordered a sashimi deluxe, it seems like super market quality. My friend got sick from eating only piece. Order the noodles to try. Again seems like supermarket microwaveable quality. The only we enjoyed was the chips. \nGive a 2 stars only Bc they are nice enough to deduct the sushi. Overall feels like an American trying to make Sushi and the noodles their thing. Won't come here again.", "author": "Kristi Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "Kimoto bar and restaurant is perfectly located in the downtown brooklyn area. Happy hour specials starts at 4:00pm daily and ends at 7:00pm. The food and drinks that are on special discounted price during those times changes according to the day. \nHere's a major plus, check in on Yelp spend 25 bucks and redeem a prize of a free bottle of sake.  \n\nThe entrance is located in the main lobby of Aloft, get there head to the 24 floor and behold the sights of the bar. The rooftop itself is nicely laid out, service is good, the views are worth it but the furniture are a bit worn.", "author": "Emily S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-29", "description": "Terrible service, the food was pretty mediocre and the hookah was a waste of money.

Went the other night for my first time. My friend was celebrating her 35th Birthday and reserved a table inside for us. It's on a rooftop so that's always cool. They have a great low key \u0026 beautiful ambiance. It was simple but did the job! They also have an outside area which is really nice to sit and have a drink or take some great pictures with a view! \n\nOur waitress seemed a little \"loopy\" or \"out of it\" for lack of better words but the food and drinks were great. Appetizers were delicious! We had the duck sliders \u0026 calamari which were yummy! Ceviche \u0026 rock shrimp tempura was ok - the spicy mayo tasted weird and was a bit runny. Kani salad was delicious but too much salad and not enough Kani lol  I had the mermaid roll which I loved but don't remember what my friends had. I believe was the dancing spider roll. \n\nThe main course I ordered the skirt steak with a side of garlic fried rice. Fried rice was great but the skirt steak tasted a little burnt for me - my friend said it was OK. Our other friend had the salmon and she said it was delicious were just too small. Hookah was good too. We had blue mist which was the best and watermelon mint (our own combo). \n\nAll in all - great spot! Def come check it out. Great music, views and good!", "author": "Angel K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-06", "description": "Waited for 15 minutes... nobody paid attention... surprise how they stay in business in NY", "author": "Dodik K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-01", "description": "amazing food and vibes!! and a great server to serve us! we ordered few cocktails and couple plates and they were amazing!!definately would come back", "author": "Sangha L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-23", "description": "Went here for a friends birthday party. Not sure what's the big hype about this place. \nFOOD:\nSubpar, especially for a Japanese sushi spot. The sushi smelled and tasted fishy. The soy garlic wings had too much flour. \nDRINKS:\nHad both bottle and bar service. Bartenders didn't know how to mix drinks. The alcohol was there but the mix tasted nasty. I was mixing better drinks from our table. \nSERVICE:\nGreat and responsive! The waitresses and the manager was helpful and always there when we needed something. Only reason why this place was getting a 3 star was because of them. \nVIEW:\nWe were on the 24th floor. Not so impressive- I saw buildings and lights.\nMUSIC:\nCouldn't bob so much to the music.

Had pre Valentines Day/ First Date Anniversary celebrations dinner with my beautiful wife. Earned complimentary saki which was excellent.

Turns out that although the views were good the service is horrible. The food was alright but nothing to rave about. I would find an alternate option and don't plan to return. I think where they fail is that they try to be too many different things a restaurant, a bar, and a hookah lounge all in one and combined with bad service it all falls apart sadly.", "author": "Ikey S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-08", "description": "Where do I begin? The food and ambiance were awesome.The skirt steak and fries, Korean bbq wings, and tiger shrimp teriyaki dishes were divine. These were some of the best fries I've ever eaten.The only downside is that my friend ordered the salmon dish and hated it. It tasted like it was seasoned in smoke. I DON'T RECOMMEND THE SALMON DISH !\n The DJ  was great and played a nice variety of music. The staff including the security were all very nice.", "author": "Dethomp T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-19", "description": "My disclaimer is that I came here for a private event so I may have a slightly different take on the bar than other patrons. When I showed up, the main bar area was pretty busy (around 9pm on Friday). The space feels a bit cluttered and seemed to be over decorated. The modern lines were lost to a dozen others. \n\nIt was easy enough to get to the bar and order a drink. The bartenders were busy but organized. The outdoor space is not huge but it is certainly big enough for 50+ people. They have been thoughtful and designated a smoking area which is well separated from the non-smoking area. The views would have been spectacular I could tell had it not been so cloudy. I don't blame the bar for the weather though. \n\nThe beer draft list consisted of almost all local brews which I appreciated. The wine list by the glass was a bit limited and the liquor list was plentiful. I was pretty impressed with the prices ($8 drafts, $14 cocktails) because they were pretty low for a rooftop bar in such a prime locale. Otherwise, in terms of rooftop bars or even bars in general, I don't think I would seek it out on my own.", "author": "Jack M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-20", "description": "Went by this spot to celebrate a birthday and I have to say it was pretty cool.

She double checked with us pointing to each item we ordered (two drinks, the one poured over cotton candy, and the one that comes in the coconut) and two rolls ( the Rainbow roll and the Samurai Roll). After another 25 minutes went by we finally got our drinks. The Cotton Candy drink was super sugary but that was totally expected so no problem there- and you could taste the alcohol in it which was nice because it was $14. The coconut drink was $15 and it was very warm and was pretty much straight milk. I had to take the ice out of my water and put it in the coconut. They brought a 3rd drink that we didn't order and said to keep it after we made sure we weren't going to be charged for it. It was so nasty and also warm. Then she comes back another 15 minutes later asking if we got our food to which we said \"no not yet\". She brings it out pretty soon after. Only one roll. Promised us we only ordered one and checked the system and there was only one roll. At that point we just wanted to leave so we asked for the bill. It seemed like she was the only waitress so I did feel bad for her she was very overwhelmed. I waitress as well I can empathize. We paid and tipped but we're never going back. Oh and the bussers wear white gloves.. gross. Every table looked miserable and seemed to have problems with their checks. It was a bad look. I don't recommend it at all.

It wasn't that busy when we arrived around 6pm, but there was a line formed at the bar to order drinks. My friend and I skipped the line and waited at two different spots at the bar. After waiting a few minutes, our orders were taken at the same time by different bartenders... so we each walked away with two drinks! It worked out kind of perfectly! The red sangria was garnished with strawberries and [what looked like] an orchid petal. Unlike most of the sangria soaked fruit I've tasted, these strawberries were terrible. They were completely bitter. That aside, the sangria itself was tasty and reasonably priced at $7 a glass during happy hour. \n\nThe rooftop area is nice with great views. The bar is bright, trendy, and welcoming. Next to it, the fully enclosed glass area was reserved for a private party so I was unable to check it out. Outside, I liked the semi-glass enclosure as it prevented a lot of wind. It's not a big space so it has limited seating, but if you can grab a seat, it's really enjoyable.", "author": "Lauren W."}], "servesCuisine": "Japanese", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Kimoto Rooftop", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "216 Duffield St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/1g9cY07z4nzuAypVR1s5zw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188588940"}
