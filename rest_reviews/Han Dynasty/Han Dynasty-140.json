Unfortunately we sat at the bar and the bartender was totally impaired.  It was 1230pm. Lunch. She slurred, she took our order 4 times. At one point she drooled while asking us for the second time if we had ever eaten there before. It was all mildly amusing watching her fumble around.  Finally we just gave up on the mains ever arriving since she very clearly could not actually enter the order in the system.  We got charged for 3 items, 2 of which we asked for the leftovers to go but that she just tossed into the garbage. She forgot to charge for 2 drinks. It was really embarrassing.  Will definitely go back because the food that we did eat was really great.", "author": "Mark A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-28", "description": "YES YES YES. I love Han Dynasty. The cuisine here  is quite flavorful and I believe they have different spice levels for everyone. Dry pepper wings and Dan Dan noodles all the way!  If you like beef then the scallion beef entree will hit the spot! I am going back again and again. Service was prompt. The servers were friendly AND the happy hour is the best! $6 wine $7 mixed cocktails. I hung out with a friend here for hours and we didn't want to leave. The ambience is pretty modern with some Asian flare and most importantly it was very clean. 5 stars all the way.", "author": "Samuel W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-09", "description": "Glad to have a 5 star place in close vicinity.

The food is incredible. The bartender was very entertaining and had great suggestions on what to order.

Appetizers are good, especially the pickled veggies. The spice level seems extremely toned down. Maybe that's because it's in a more commercialized food court/market type setting? Maybe it's because they give their white customers less spice? I wouldn't be upset if that's the case, I know that that is a common practice. But, I specifically talked to the waitress about wanting things spicy and with the peppercorn flavor, and was still let down; I ordered a level 10 dish today and it tasted maybe like a 5-6. I've been here multiple times since it's so close to my apartment, but I think it's about time I find Szechuan in this city that isn't a let down.", "author": "Thom T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "Good but not mind-blowing. I liked the flavor of the dan dan noodles-- spicy and numbing-- but the noodles were overcooked. They should be springy and chewy, not mushy. The dry fried chicken wings were mediocre-- very crispy but not flavorful. I was worried that they would be super spicy (on the menu they are a 9/10 spice level) but you can pick off most of the chilis. The dominant flavor of the wings is cumin, which is not my favorite. We also got the garlic chicken, which looked and tasted like your average Chinese food take out place. My son really loved the wonton soup (with house made wontons.) Prices are a little high for the size of the portions.", "author": "Sarah G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-09", "description": "A few weeks ago, we made a reservation for 10, but then showed up with 16.

The food is very authentic and not at all americanized. The pickles veggies were unreal. Chose dry pot w steamed tofu because did not want super greasy and it wasn't, was perfect. Husband and I shared those two items and we were perferctly full for very little money. The cold Torrontes wine was perfect to complement the Szechuan spice.

The sauce and seasoning they used for all 3 dishes had ma la (numbing spice) in the dishes and was quite yummy but I couldn't quite differentiate the taste between the 3.  Everything ended up tasting the same.

This place is Schezuan style chinese food.  The best schezuan style dish is hands down is dan dan noodles!  This place did not disappoint.  We had the dan dan noodles and the garlic sauce chicken.

My fianc\u00e9 and I come basically once a week and have an amazing time every visit. The food is fresh and delicious, drinks on point, and service- amazing!! Our favorite person is Gina at the bar, her fun and energetic spirit makes the night. She is on point, remembers every part of your order and just all around makes you enjoy your visit. Mike and Han are also amazing! Overall we come back here whenever at Dekalb again and again!

The food was not on par compared to other Han Dynastys. If you are looking for a quick imitation of the other Han Dynastys then eat here. However beware that the quality of food and portion size is not the same. Most importantly they had the nerve to overcharge my credit card.\n\nWarning to all customer: Keep your receipt so you can appeal the total amount you paid including tips with your credit card company. This place will tack on additional amounts thinking that customers will not notice.
