For a Sunday brunch, the brief menu might surprise some folks but then upon seeing portions and the quality of taste that goes into each mason jar of drinks, or retro-tin platters, you realize: Henry Public works.\n\nI'd highly recommend sampling their specials, eclectic yet down-to-earth on the brunch menu. I sampled a Spicy Pickle and Hard Boiled Egg Sandwich with fresh kettle chips which could work to be devoured in the mornings, savored in the evenings, or anytime in between.

The turkey leg sandwich.  After years of hearing of this sandwich, I finally got to try it this weekend and it exceeded all the hype I've heard.  The sandwich is like a big, cozy, warm blanket hug when it's cold outside.  It's incredibly flavorful and comforting.  I could eat it every week.  We also tried the deviled eggs which were very good.  Prob my second favorite in the city behind Spotted Pig.  \n\nThe atmosphere was also super chill and relaxed.  We came in around 3 on a Saturday and it was perfect.  A couple of tables taken up but plenty of space.  The service was friendly and good.  We will definitely be back.  I'd like to say I'll try more things there but it's going to take a while for me to stray from that turkey leg sandwich!", "author": "Tiffany S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-09", "description": "A great place to have a drink. We walked in around 10PM, and the place was full, but not crowded. I felt transported to a different era: 19th century saloon. And I liked it.  The bartenders were attentive despite the never ending queue for cocktails. Each drink was carefully crafted with precision.  The prices for the cocktails were a bit pricey for Brooklyn standards ($10 and $11) but well worth it.  \nHere is the rundown:\n\n1.  Kings County Sour - (rye whiskey, lemon, sugar, egg white, port float) Sort of like a whiskey sour but with a nice kick thanks to the egg whites. The cherry garnish was tasty!\n\n2.  Wide Awake cocktail - (gin, lemon, ginger (fresh and liqueur and isley scotch) A grown up gin and tonic. I really liked the dried crystallized ginger that garnished the drink. \n\n3.  Public Smash - (bourbon, mint, maple syrup, aromatic bitters) Wow this drink was strong and cut to the chase! \n\nI did peruse the menu and spied a \"marrow bones\" dish and although we didn't try it this time, something tells me I will be lured back for more!\n\nPS They have coat hooks under their zinc-topped walnut bar. That is always a plus on my list. That means the owner(s) were thoughtful when planning out the place.", "author": "Vivian H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-09", "description": "I can't help myself.

I'm sure I'm too unironic and mainstream to understand the appeal of this place.  As I sat down in the faux-old decor of the place and got my overpriced menu, I thought I might be in for a \"treat\".  But my friend highly recommended the place, so I stuck around.  By the time my 8oz Coca-Cola arrived -- complete in the old style bottle -- I knew I was right.  \n\nIt didn't get much better from there.  I can appreciate a rare steak, and if the quality of the beef is high enough, I've even been known to tolerate a medium well burger.  But a blue cheese burger shouldn't come out \"blue\" -- meaning completely cold in the center and the outside just seared enough to let you know it had seen a grill.  I guess this is the ironic thing I just don't get.   Either way, I really couldn't eat a two inch thick burger that was essentially a lump of raw ground meat.   Fortunately, it was replaced with a proper medium burger, though this took quite a while to actually happen.\n\nHowever, the service was very good, and the fries were done just right.  That saves this from being a one-star review, since I'm not a hipster and don't appreciate \"fine\" cuisine.", "author": "Jack M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-15", "description": "Beer menu was fantastic- Old Hen Cream Ale was tops.

The cocktails are well-made, but expensive for the neighborhood.  And worse expensive to be cash only.  \n\nThe burger and fries are really good, but the service is kind of terrible.  Sure, the waiters/waitresses are dressed in old-timey getups to help with the ambiance and its cute, but they are not very attentive - and the bartender won't serve you if you are at a table.  So, you just end up sitting there waiting to try to catch Mr. Handlebars Mustache on your way to the restroom.  Poor service is something I can't forgive.  Sorry.  I can get a great burger and fries at plenty of other places (for far cheaper).\n\nAlso, the place gets loud.  REALLY REALLY LOUD.  Like scream to be heard by the person sitting directly to your left loud.  \n\nIn my mind, good food and cocktails cannot make up for poor service, overly loud and cramped space, and expensive eats/drinks.", "author": "Vicky L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-26", "description": "It's very nice place .who like old school gonna love this place ,I like everything  in there ;)......so go check if u have time :).....:)", "author": "Artur A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-20", "description": "Such an adorable place!  We stumbled into here for a drink after wandering around Brooklyn for a bit in the cold and decided to stay for some food.  We split the turkey leg sandwich(which came with fries and AMAZING pickles), a side of brussel sprouts with bacon and an order of deviled eggs.  There were only three eggs in the plate, which I found bizarre.  What happened to the other half of that egg?  Very tasty, just strange to see deviled eggs not served in pairs.  The sandwich was fantastic; I'd probably go back for that alone.  \n\nMinus one star for being a little overpriced.", "author": "Stephanie O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-31", "description": "Preface: I would have given this place 4.5 if that were an option (see last paragraph). \n\nSo I've been to Henry Public a handful of times and, as of now, just returned from my most recent visit so consider this review hot off the presses. I opted for a seat at the bar as I was by myself and just looking to have a nice dinner after a long day and was quickly taken care of by the attentive bartender (I didn't catch her name). \n\nThe menu is not very extensive and every time I've gone there I've ordered the same entree, the turkey leg sandwich. The other entree options on the menu are burgers, mac and cheese, steak, marrow bones, or salads in addition to a selection of vegetables/small sides. All of which I feel you can get easily at other establishments and once you've had this turkey sandwich, you'll likely agree that there is no reason to be adventurous with the entree selection. The turkey meat is exceptionally juicy and the thick cut bread, with a nice slight char from the grill,  absorbs all the run off juices before it turns into a sloppy mess. This is such a hearty sandwich that you'll easily forget about the mound of fries on the other side of the plate.\n\nBut you don't just come here for the food...this is a cocktail bar afterall. I was quite pleased with the Kings County Sour and the Brooklyn Ferry, both of which are rye based drinks. The Kings County was a refreshing/semi sweet drink with egg whites, lemon, and port float while the Brooklyn Ferry hits like a heavyweight with the rye, vermouth, maraschino liqueur and absinthe. Normally, I'm not a fan of absinthe because the liquorice flavor it usually imparts but the bartender assured me that it was a well balanced blend and not overpowering. I went with her recommendation and am certainly all the better for it. \n\nLastly, the ambiance of the place is regular Brooklyn-chic (read: suspenders, facial hair, and nothing (except for the ipod) made in the last 70 years adorning the walls). It is overall a pretty classy place given that is just a stones throw away from the hustle and bustle of Atlantic Ave. It does seem to fill up pretty quickly and I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group here. Also note that it is a cash only establishment with the nearest ATM being across the street so plan ahead. \n\nSo what stopped the 5-star review? The prices could stand to be reduced a little bit. You feel as though you're in Little Branch or Dutch Kills when you are cashing out. I would like to try a little more of the small plates before I can pass full judgement on the food options. Also, the seating situation can be tight and had I not have been there early enough I could have easily walked in and turned around due to overcrowding.", "author": "Troy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-10", "description": "Wait staff polite, generous and helpful.

That makes Henry Public a perfectly nice place to drop in for one or two really good cocktails or beers and maybe a shared dish, but it isn't a food destination and it's a little too expensive for most people to be able to go frequently anyway. \n\nOne last thing about the cocktails: if you like super-sugary cocktails, this isn't the place for you.

While they didn't have mimosas on the menu, they were nice enough to quickly whip some up for us anyway (though at around $10 each, they were not cheap-- might've been more worth it to get a regular cocktail!).\n\nIt was pretty empty the early Saturday afternoon we were there, but had a pretty laidback feel which was exactly what we needed.

However, don't let that detract from Henry Public. Underneath there's a great bar lurking with some pretty delicious food to boot. \n\nThey serve awesome cocktails (Kings Country Sour and Sweet Liberty Smash were my personal favorites of the evening) and the bartenders are really cool. My biggest beef with the place is that it is a bit pricey for cash-only establishment.\n\nAs far as the food goes, the turkey leg sandwich is amazing. It's also huge, so don't go overboard with other things. The pickles were a bit boring but the deviled eggs were good (yet still not worth the money in my mind) . Had a side of brussel sprouts as well, but I found them to be a bit overcooked. The french fries are boring (particularly for being pretentiously billed on the menu as \"french-fried potatoes\"). Wilkersons are awesome (fried dough always is, though), but I was not so much a fan of the rum sauce.\n\nAll in all, Henry Public is a great spot.
