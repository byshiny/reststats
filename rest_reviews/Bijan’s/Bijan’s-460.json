The food selection was simple, yet all the items on the menu was flavorful.  It was the perfect setting for a date.  It was quiet and laid back.  For an appetizer we had the persian spiced chicken wings and the white goat cheese flat bread.  We should have order only one, since the portions were so large.  For the entree we had the lime, sumac, rosemary chicken breast and the hanger steak frites.  I must admit the steak was juicy, tender and seasoned to perfection and the chicken breast meal was absolutely delicious.  The reason I rated them a four instead of a five is because of the limited menu.  However, overall a great experience, I am glad I gave this small place a try.", "author": "Janel F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-15", "description": "I stumbled upon this place on a cold afternoon with a friend looking for a bite to eat and an alcoholic drink to warm up with. I wasn't feeling too daring so I had a burger with cheese and a side of their special chips and my friend was recommended the lamb burger by the waitress/bartender. The food was delicious. We were the only customers there, so I can't really comment on the service other than the fact that our waitress whipped up great cocktails for happy hour. I am definitely looking forward to my next visit here.", "author": "Adriane C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-16", "description": "This place manages to mess up dishes that are delicious everywhere else and charge way too much.

The $15 price fix which includes a drink is a great deal. The food was solid, I personally like the very crisp bacon, but I know some people like it a bit chewier. Blood Mary's were terrific, spicey with various pickles as garnish.", "author": "G O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-06", "description": "Hands down best place for happy hour and appetizers in Downtown Brooklyn!

The Steak and truffle fries are really great, as is the cucumber salad with feta!  And the growing bar staff is great!

Hanger steak  cook perfect med. rare \u0026 truffle fries were crispy and flavorful, made from fresh potatoes. My wife had the pork belly special all she said was\" Holy Swine\".  We been there to the bar before for cocktails our bartender was Alex he was great. We only had the  wings OMG they are the best in the city. He made us wild cocktails with ginger and tequila and my wife had pump up the jam. He made us promise to come back for dinner.  It's our new local.

The atmosphere was okay. The place itself is a cozy space and has some interesting artwork. The problem was that we were there for dinner and were expecting good food given the high yelp rating. The menu didn't have many items to choose from. My friend got the salmon after asking if the portion was good sized and being assured that it was.  What came was a very small strip of salmon that was very bland. I ordered calamari and it tasted like it may have been breaded and frozen for awhile. The sauce it came with didn't have much taste. Our drinks were good but the food was only mediocre. The music was loud for a restaurant, okay for a bar. Personally, I don't need to hear Pearl Jam blasting while I eat. Maybe come here for drinks if you live in the neighborhood, but if you are hungry go someplace else.", "author": "Cynthia D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-15", "description": "My husband and I went to Bijan's Thursday evening. The food was delicious. The service was excellent. I had the lamb burger which was the best burger I ever ate and the hubby had the special pizza with sugar snap peas, fava beans, fresh tomatoes with goat cheese....delicious!

I've been going to Bijan's for the past 2 years and it keeps getting worse and worse. The bartenders are super nice and the food is decent, but it takes 45 minutes to an hour to get a burger. The service is downright awful and it starts with the owner. He is inattentive and has no idea how to be hospitable. He does not rectify issues about wait time or poor service of the waitress'. I've never been in any other establishment where people are waiting for drinks/food for a significant amount of time and the owner or manager does not come over and apologize for the inconvenience. The waitress on Wednesdays is in her own world. She does not pay attention to detail and will take your order 30 minutes after you sit down, it's insane! The seating here sucks. The tables are very wobbly and extremely unsteady. I really wanted to Bijan's to be my neighborhood bar, but it has not met expectations. With all the new spots in the neighborhood popping up (Livingston Manor, Grand Army) their is no reason to continue to get awful service and support a place who does not care about customer experience. I will not waste my money here anymore and suggest everyone else in the neighborhood do the same.", "author": "Wilie D."}], "servesCuisine": "American (New)", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Bijan\u2019s", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "81 Hoyt St", "postalCode": "11211", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/T7kx9MI3K8lc9ola82vHow/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188555574"}
