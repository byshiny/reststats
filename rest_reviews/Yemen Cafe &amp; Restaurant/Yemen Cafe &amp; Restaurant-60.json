Though I'm still not sure if it was lamb, it tasted like seasoned overcooked pork to me. And I had to wait 20 minutes for my food to arrive.

I was very hesitant until I stepped in and noticed that the crowd was mostly middle eastern.  We were lucky to be seated right away, but 15 minutes later there was a line.  \n\nWhen you sit down, a large falafel like bread about 14 inches in diameter, salad, and lentil based soup is brought out to you before you order.  I asked the waiter for his recommendation and told him it was our first time here.  Without hesitation he said number 19, the lamb, slowed cooked for 5 hours with a side of rice.  The dish is for one person but with one baba ganoush appetizer it was enough for two along with the presets.\n\nOne of the best baba ganoush I've had in my life and I've had many.  The lamb was very flavorful, moist, and fell apart with the touch of the fork.\n\nI would definitely stop in again if I was in the area and craving middle eastern cuisine.", "author": "Howie H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-28", "description": "I've been here on multiple occasions and it's about time to review this place. \nLet's just put it out there... you don't come for the ambiance, you come here to experience some homey soul fulfilling Arabic comfort food. \nAfter growing up in the Middle East, specifically in the gulf, I can assure you that this place serves up some pretty authentic and delicious Arabian gulf cuisine. The menu isn't really varied enough, but what they do make, is made well. I typically order the lamb haneeth: a slow cooked lamb shank with pungent spices atop a bed of ghee infused basmati rice! It's so simple in its form and presentation but the flavors are developed, complex and delicious! I've had the chicken haneeth, the chicken tawook as well, though the lamb remains my favorite. It's really hard to find a lamb well cooked! If you are not a lamb eater, I sure think that this should convert you! I don't fancy their appetizers much, except their broth soup- I think you should save that valuable belly space for the main event. \n4 stars for food, prompt service and consistent quality, but still find that the management could improve restaurant appearance and also work on prices and portions as I feel it's too expensive! \nSahten", "author": "Mae A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-11", "description": "Oh man I did not expect this meal to be this good.

Omg! I ordered Lamb Haneeth and it was the most tender fall of the bone juicy delicious roasted meat. It's so well seasoned, unlike other places I've tried lamb shanks from. The platter comes with soup (also delicious) and salad. I think the soup is made with lamb broth so it's very hearty.  To top it all off, they have milk tea that's so light and tasty. It's the perfect balance of tea, milk, and sweetness! I would totally go back again, but only for special occasions because this place is quite pricy!

We were walking around the Brooklyn Bridge park on a pretty day and went in search of a late lunch. Once we sat down, items started appearing - bread, lemons, lamb broth (if you want it, I refused because vegetarian/vegan) before we even ordered.\n\nThe two of us shared the vegetable main (which I didn't deeply inquire into vegan-ness, I just went with it) and a starter of hummus. I was easily really full, and my friend who was on the edge of hangry, hunger-wise, was satisfied. Lovely place, has a nice bustle to it without being too overwhelming.", "author": "Pam S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-09", "description": "My friend speaks very highly, and ever since we became friends has vowed to take me here as it was the best Yemeni food (outside of his mother's!) he's had, hands down. Finally, our schedules aligned and he was able to take me here! It's a far commute, but the area of Brooklyn is really nice and I don't mind it too much. We went near the tail end of lunch (~2 pm), and expected no wait (which held true). We were seated immediately, and since my friend speaks the language he was able to order everything for us (we were a group of 3, one of whom is vegetarian). We took a quick look at the menu but he ended up ordering for us: he got the lamb shank for himself, me the minced lamb, and our vegetarian friend the grilled vegetables. They served us their form of \"bread,\" which I don't quite know the name of but it looks like a thin pizza sized crepe that's crunch on the outside and soft on the inside (so.. good.. and it's unlimited through the meal!!) served with a small salsa of sorts. They also have this red tea that is self serve that is inherently a little sweet, to which you can add condensed milk (which I guess is a common tradition in the Middle East, that was also super good and complemented our meal perfectly). Each entree comes with a small lamb broth based lentil soup that was good but a little strong for my taste (I'm not much of a lamb person), but I was glad to be able to try. Our entrees came out pretty soon after that soup, and those portion sizes were HUGE. I'm a big eater and I couldn't finish my food! The plates are big, and your entree meat/veggie is served with rice. I had enough for lunch the next day. I had no complaints, my minced lamb was super well spiced and I enjoyed it very much. For dessert, again I don't know the name but it was the \"oatmeal-like\" consistency with honey and fresh whipped cheese. It was so soothing. I appreciate desserts that aren't super sweet, and the way they present this dessert was just perfect. A good end to a heavily spiced meal, I would definitely come back again, I wish I lived closer!", "author": "Carol L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-28", "description": "Every meal comes w salad soup and bread (Mediterranean hospitality).

Yemen Cafe features the eponymous Yemeni cuisine. The country sits south of Saudi Arabia between Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Thus, Yemeni food would be expectedly cosmopolitan and differ from Levantine cuisine and its Mediterranean influences.\n\nAs soon as I arrived, the waiter served not just a glass of water but a bowl of soup. Marag (or marageh) is a lamb soup. Don't let its pale green color fool you. It's really good. It's also served hot, which I recommend letting it cool first. Immediately after ordering, the waiter gave me a giant bread that resembled naan. But it was the size of one's face! The bread was not awfully chewy and tasted good when I dipped parts of it into the sauce mixture that came along.\n\nI ordered the chicken zorbian, which reminded me a little of the chicken and rice platters that have become a staple at halal carts. But this is the real deal. The chicken wasn't dry and was cubed. According to the menu, it's curried chicken made with tomatoes and onions. They also used basmati rice, spring onions, parsley, and onion. The rice was colored red, presumably from the preparation, seeing that it was mixed thoroughly with the chicken. \n\nPrices for lamb are steeper than those for chicken. Every lamb entree is $21.49 compared to chicken, which was set back at $15.95. There is a huge discrepancy of the prices if you come during lunch. You'd pay $12.95 for lamb dishes and $11.95 for chicken. \n\nService was really quick and my food came in within 20 minutes of ordering.", "author": "Henry M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-03", "description": "If you're looking for a warm delicious middle eastern meal that reminds you of home, you're in the right place!

Really amazing Kabsa, skip the kebabs it's not the kind of place for that.  Yemeni cuisine is unique and not at all suited for grilled meats but rather slow cooked desert meats.  Here is how it's done.  Lamb is spiced and slow cooked for hours until fork tender and the Kabsa is a rice dish slow cooker with chicken scallions and other delicious spices.

Not only is the lamb the best lamb I've had (Lamb Haneeth), but the saltah (vegetable stew) is great, and the freshly baked bread keeps on coming!
