If your are a snob and enjoy dining and drinking in the company of snobs then you will like this place. I live next door and have been here many times by virtue of convenience over the last three years and this is my prevailing impression. I apparently do not meet the invisible bar the bartender sets with regard to who he treats with courtesy and who he blows off as someone who doesn't deserve decent treatment. All I want when I go here is a drink with a minimum of drama, but even that seems beyond the reach of the stuck up tiny dog owners who work here. I went in tonight and ordered a jack and coke. I realize this isn't the typical $13 cocktail, but I live next door. The bartender first handed me a warm, 6 oz bottle of coke followed by whiskey after a 10 minute wait. I'm not stupid. I know when I'm being insulted. I'm sorry I didn't pick up the requisite sophisticated drinking habits while I was living a non-hipster, normal life. Like I said, I live next door and have been here many times. I've been treated disrespectfully almost every time, but tonight finally put me over the edge and convinced me to make a yelp account specifically for this place. So don't go here.

Thus, the four stars are an average of several experiences--pretty high, as averages go. \n\nThe pros: Turkey. Leg. Sandwich. I agree with many that it does not sound like it's going to be amazing. But it is. they put little bits of battered and fried onions on it. Seriously, crack in turkey form. \n\nI also enjoy the deviled eggs and the lamb chop special, whenever they have it. It's the best lamb I've ever tried. \n\nMany here have complained about the service, but for the most part I've experienced nothing but friendliness. Maybe some of the surly people were let go? Anyway, that's never been a problem for me. \n\nThe cons? Gets super crowded, so you have to go early or be patient. Also, I'm not blown away by their brunch options. And ironically, brunch was the only time I've had to wait an unreasonably long time for food, which is weird because the place was mostly empty. I guess we were among the first customers and they hadn't gotten their act together quite yet. \n\nI realize I'm leaving out their cocktails, which are supposed to be the main attraction. I'm a beer and wine gal myself. If a drink has more than four ingredients and one of them is bitters, it's just too high maintenance for me.

Cute place too.  The crowd is a little pretentious but when you're with the right people, as I was, it didn't matter.  This past Saturday it seemed like the perfect hang for a Wall Street release party.  Supreme service from the attentive bartenders who dropped whatever attitude everyone keeps talking about, and poured my drink right away.  I had questions about the extensive cocktail menu, they responded.  Unfortunately I wasn't there for long so I could not enjoy the scrumptious meal options or the roasted almonds, as I am allergic.  Instead I enjoyed an \"Oddfellow\", a roaring 20s-style cocktail, with rum, grapefruit, lime, house bark, maraschino and root syrup ( a tad too much but I got its drift).

I had a great meal here on a Wednesday night.  Service was friendly, ambiance was good (not too loud, but comfortably populated... five-minute wait for a seat at 10 pm).  Most importantly, their menu now includes daily vegetable specials, which happened to be very good on this day: heirloom bean soup and braised mustard greens.  The turkey sandwich was good, and the juniper pickles are nice (assuming you like juniper).\n\nI had the house red which was fine.

Very nice atmosphere, very intimate environment. \n\nThe food menu is surprisingly short. Out of the few items, the turkey leg sandwich is awesome. It's extremely moist, easily the most moist turkey that I've ever had. My only complaint is the bread used in the sandwich (milk bread) is a bit too thick and dense, but I guess it serves its purpose by being sturdy enough to hold the moist turkey meat.  \n\nIf I'm not in the mood for the turkey leg sandwich, the burger is also extremely good.
