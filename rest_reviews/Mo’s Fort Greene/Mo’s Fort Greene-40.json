The bouncers are horrible and disgusting. I've been coming to this place off and on since 2006. Boy how times have changed. The bouncers have no higher than an 8th grade education and bouncing at Moes is the greatest accomplishment they will ever have. Be prepared to deal with nasty attitudes and any excuse to put their hands on someone.", "author": "Jade B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-01", "description": "They FINALLY take credit/debit. Yay!\n\nMo's is really hit or miss with several things:\n\nThe bartenders vary in skill/drink mixing -- so sometimes you get a really strong, well made drink... other times it's weak or poorly mixed.\n\nThe waitresses are usually friendly, but there just aren't enough of them. Usually there's only 1 when the place is packed.\n\nThe DJs are usually pretty good, but sometimes it seems as though they don't watch or pay attention to their crowd. When the music's good, it's good and people dance the night away on a rather compact dance floor.\n\nI've never had the food, so I can't comment on that.\n\nThey have a decent number of TVs if you're there to watch sports.\n\nThe crowd is interesting. Usually the crowd is mostly late 20s to early 50s African-Americans. More often than not there are several creep 40-50 y/o men with few manners, looking for some youngins, which is just NOT ok. I've seen a lot of couples here on dates, so I suppose it's an ok date spot. Also, there are a lot of regulars.\n\nOverall the experience is never BAD, and there's never a dull moment. I keep coming back b/c it's in the neighborhood and it's just an overall chill spot to go.", "author": "Adri P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "MO's is a great low key spot if you want to go have a drink with a small group of friends with ample seating available. Mos has happy hour everyday! Well drinks and drafts are nicely priced too! The DJ played a variety of music, mostly old school hip hop from the 90s, but it was enjoyable nonetheless .

Bouncer snatched my ID out of my hand and threw it in my purse. Proceed politely and tried to talk nicely too him. However he keep screaming and yelling at me until\nManager had to come outside and break it off. He was being verbally abusive. Have been going to this place for year never been any issues. Had to call the police. If you go here come during early hours not night time they have rude and disrespectful bouncers that will treat you like dirt on the floor.

This was my first time going and had no idea what to expect and I had heard mixed reviews about this place.   There are two sections to this establishment which includes the main bar area and then a back room which has seating and where the DJ spins at.  My cocktail server, Desi, was attentive and was on top of her game.  The DJ was rocking and I had me moving all night.  He was playing some current hip hop and some classic.  He had awesome control of the  crowd and I will definitely be back again for the tunes and drinks.", "author": "Dominek T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-03-20", "description": "My first and last visit  occurred February 4th during the end cap of Happy Hour. My friends visit this place often and invited me out. At first, we were having a great time and our initial bartender so friendly and accommodating. \n\nOnce he left and as we were getting ready to leave, two of the staffers thought it was appropriate to laugh and participate in the insulting language started by two patrons at the bar regarding my body type and my outfit. \n\nThe situation escalated to the point that we involved management and he told us that there was nothing he could do and that he wouldn't apologize for the behavior of his staff and mentioned that we were interrupting his lunch break and insinuated that we were being paranoid, even though myself and my friend heard the words that were being exchanged. He was so belligerent that he made my friend angry to the point of tears and at that point, we left. \n\nI am a small business owner and I prefer to patronize small businesses. With the plethora of bars and lounges in the city, I have a choice on where I spend my hard earned dollars. Unfortunately, that will no longer happen at this establishment.", "author": "Lauren B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "So Tuesday Night all roads lead to MOS!

Sometimes it's jumping. Other times, it isn't. It can seem a bit packed on weekends due to the size \u0026 the 1 drink requirement to go upstairs; where the dance floor is.\n\nThe drinks aren't the strongest. Not to mention that one time I was served a round of watered down patron shots!\n\nAll in all.. Moes is the ideal place to catch up w/ friends after work. Or a pit stop on a night out bar hopping..
