(Alternatively and more expensively, you can take a water taxi that will deposit you at a pier down the street, then walk back to work off your meal.) The interior probably hasn't changed since it first opened its doors - the decor consists of plastic red-checked tablecloths and hundreds of autographed photos of famous patrons. This is New York-style pizza, pure and simple . . . there isn't an arugula leaf in sight. A thin crust is topped by tangy tomato sauce and thick slabs of buffalo mozzarella oozing towards the crisp edges, and topping options don't get much fancier than pepperoni and black olives. Definitely avoid this place at the usual lunch and dinner hours, or you'll wait for nearly as long as it's been here.

After so many attempts at eating there, it was eventually decided to order it to go, the wait was about a half hr or so. The pizza smelled sooo delicious, I couldn't wait to get home to eat it. The drive was about 20 minutes, but by the time it got home, the pizza was already cold (it was around winter time) and had to be reheated in the oven. Although the pizza was good, it could have been better. I had high expectations considering how famous Grimaldi's is and also due to the pizza's initial tantalizing scent. I suspect it's better to eat the pizza right there and then at the restaurant. I had a much better experience at Lombardi's.", "author": "Xiomi R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-10-02", "description": "SHOCKINGLY AWFUL.  1) Waiters slow and rude. 2) We asked for OLIVES and got ONIONS.  3) The onions made the crust completely SOGGY and like glue. 4) We also asked for mushrooms, which were TINY SLIVERS, almost invisible and gave NO FLAVOR.  5) HORRIBLE WINE.  6)  Music so LOUD we could not have a conversation without saying WHAT? 5 times.  7)  One of the staff came and took one of our party's coats and threw it on a coat rack by the door.  Didn't even ASK who it belonged to. When our older friend came back from the embarrassing bathroom, he completely freaked out, thinking it had been stolen.  No one had seen the man take it.

We waited for 1h in the cold but it was well worth it. All the hype is true. Its the best brooklyn pizza with the best view! The staff was very nice.

And even though I'm not sure that Grimaldi's qualifies as \"New-York style\" pizza, I will concede that it is better than anything I have had in Chicago, or anywhere else for that matter (so good I had it twice during my one-week visit). The margherita was the best, perfect in its simplicity, so much so that I barely noticed how sardined in everyone is.

Not many words were spoken during this meal. Expect to wait in line, expect to be a little cramped while eating, expect a great old style pizza. Lots of toppings are great, but I recommend the plain as it's held it's own since day one and will not disappoint.

We arrived just after 12 noon and were seated right away by a friendly server who took the time to fix our unsteady table.  We got a large pizza with mushrooms.  Now, I must say that the place smells incredible.  As eating is a sensory experience, you are convinced that the pizza that will come out of the oven will be the most amazing pizza you've ever tasted.  As for the real thing?  Yes, the pizza is good, the crust is thin, the basil is tasty, you've not overwhelmed by the cheese, etc.  I easily ate (and regretted eating) four slices, since the pizza probably wouldn't have reheated well, and cooled off really quickly.  It didn't taste like the smell, though, so as for it being the best pizza in NYC, I can't be sure.  But I would say go at least once for the old school dining experience and a tasty thin crust pizza.", "author": "Kim D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-22", "description": "After hearing so many great things about this place, maybe my expectations were too high.

Unfortunately, it was BEYOND disappointing. \n\nOur first and, most definitely, last visit to Grimaldi's was on July 12, 2010. After getting lost for at least an hour trying to find this \"hidden treasure\", we were met with a semi-descent line outside. We must've gotten there just after the lunch-hour rush because the line got really long very quickly. Regardless, this line was very deceiving. It still took us an hour to get to the front of the line where the hostess was kind enough to let a group of 10 cut in front of us because supposedly they were \"friends of the owner\". Sigh. \n\nInside was very crammed since there were way too many tables for such a small place. It'll be a miracle if you get through their maze of tables without bumping into or being bumped by other people. Now comes the bad part of our experience. lol. First was our waiter, who was kind of obnoxious in my opinion. It took him awhile to come over and take our order but when he finally arrived he was nice enough to get \"up close and personal\" by placing his crotch on my shoulder which I gently shrugged off. Then he kept slamming down our drinks and almost hit my hand! I was already in a really bad mood at this point but I wanted to give this place another chance to wow me with their food. Their pizza, even with an odd choice of cheese (mozzarella, i think), was actually not too bad but is simply not enough to deserve such high praises from so many people. Their calzone, on the other hand, was simply horrible. I'm not sure what was in that thing but it was bland and the cheese had the texture of spoiled milk. It was like eating sugar-free whipped cream inside a piece of bread! \n\nOverall, Grimaldi's is just an over-hyped pizza place! There are a million pizza places in New York City that taste just as good, if not better, without the hassle of long lines, uncomfortably rude waiters, and strange cheese! Take Famous Famiglia Pizzeria for example! But hey, ours was just a one-time experience. It could have just been a sequence of  unusually bad coincidences for all I know. This was from one man's perspective so if you have nothing better to do and have lots of patience then I suggest you give them a try. Just don't go out of your way to visit or expect too much from a pizza place. One thing's for sure though. I can now say, \"I've eaten at Grimaldi's\". haha!
