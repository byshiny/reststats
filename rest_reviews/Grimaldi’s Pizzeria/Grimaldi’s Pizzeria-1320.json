While my friends were able to enjoy the experience in the restaurant, I ended up having the leftovers. My hopstop app failed me and gave me directions to take the R from Jay St. to S.Ferry/Whitehall. Realizing I was in Manhattan and over the bridge instead of under I hopped in a cab. Welp that didn't help me either the cabbie claimed to know where the place was. However, after 35 minutes of driving back and forth across the bridge from BK to Manhattan, he finally said he had no clue and said he was now off-duty and I could ride with him to the Bronx. -_-  Um no thanks. I decided to get out of the cab and meet my friends at the next destination. \n\nNonetheless, even the leftover slices were good and still tasted fresh hours later. My pals had ordered the regular with black olives, mushrooms, and extra basil. I've since gone back twice to eat at the restaurant and I've been lucky enough to avoid the long lines. Trick to beating the long lines: Go on a rainy day, I've done it twice and there were no long lines or wait times. \n\nI love how the pizza is made to order and arrives fresh out of the oven. The staff is very friendly. Plus, this $14 bucks for a regular is more than enough for two people to split. Not a bad price at all. A few downfalls, the seating is a bit cramped and they only accept cash. I will warn to bring enough because the ATM in the restaurant has a $4.50 transactions fee! Never seen anything like it lol. Overall, I recommend anyone looking for a good pie to try Grimaldi's.", "author": "Amanda A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-31", "description": "Oh, Grimaldi's you let me down the second time.\n\nThe first visit my out-of-town friend and I LOVED. Delicious sauce, fresh cheese and basil, cooked to perfection. We devoured the entire pie and then walked the Brooklyn bridge to burn it off.\nThe next year we went back. Luckily both times on a Wed. night, with no line at all. We were greatly disappointed. The sauce was not the same, there was less cheese and the crust was burned, wayy overcooked.  It was like a totally different pizza we didn't even want to finish this time. :(\n\nPerhaps they cut back and cheapened their ingredients? Too bad because I won't be returning. If in Brooklyn by the bridge, it is good to try once...Hopefully their better qualitly returns.", "author": "Alexandra C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-16", "description": "This place was AWESOME.\n\nI do believe it is the best pizza I've ever tasted.\n\nMy cousin and I visited this place during our trip to NYC for new years. After a stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge, we stopped by this place around 4 pm and were surprised there was a third floor for people waiting to get in the joint. Very impressive. We only waited 10 minutes or so.\n\nThe place is crowded, but what place in NYC isn't? They served Stewarts cream soda - a delicacy you can only find at select shops. \n\nThe pizza itself was YUM! There was fresh mozzarella bubbling from the pizza when it was served.\n\nI hated that we were going to the Nets game and couldn't bring the last uneaten slice with us - it was a tragedy to leave such good food on the table. Would've made for a great midnight snack.\n\nThis place is well worth a trip to Brooklyn if you have time.

No question their secrets are a time-tested procedure and a brick oven. The new location has definitely eliminated a lot of the cons that the old location had--cramped elbow-to-elbow room and dim \u0026 dreary lighting--but it also felt like it lost a piece of who it was: a poorly-light, true Brooklyn Pizzeria. Nonetheless, we can't complain because the pizza is as true as it gets. \nThe prize here is the tomato sauce -- so unbelievable sweet and chunky. If there is anything better than fresh buffalo mozzarella spotted-ly placed atop--it's the tomato sauce. The crust is thin, crunchy and sporadically blackened, there's no question that the ingredients convey the highest of quality at Grimaldi's. I only wish they were a little more free with the basil, as our pizza only had one measly leaf. I recommend ordering extra basil--however I remember the pies I received back then were plentiful with basil--perhaps another inconsistency with this new location. I can't say this is the best pizza in NYC, but Grimaldis has definitely held its own all these years.", "author": "Josephine Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-20", "description": "NEW YORK = PIZZA = GRIMALDI'S\nThin coal fried pizza - delicious sauce, delicious toppings..\nNo wonder they have been around for so long.... \n\nCASH ONLY - \n\nService was ok - waiter did not come by to check if everything was ok - but it was super busy..

Came back by accident after touring Dumbo and noticed the unusually short line. Caught a break. Still the same great pizza. Too bad they do not serve wine. Service was attentive and friendly.

Probably not...but I'll write it anyways.\n\nWhile Grimaldi's pizza was good, I wasn't by any means blown away.  I've been to one of the other NYC pizza staples, Lombardi's, and I enjoyed their pizza more than Grimaldi's.  \n\nAt Grimaldi's I would highly recommend getting at least one kind of topping on your pie, as the regular pizza couldn't really stand on its own.  The crust is delicious, thin, and crunchy but I wish they put the sauce up a little higher-there was just way to much crust at the top and that is coming from someone who LOVES crust.\n\nThe upstairs is hot and cramped and the servers were very crabby and unfriendly when we were there on a Monday afternoon.  I'm sure it can get hectic with tourists galore but if you work there I assume you know what you're getting into.  \n\nIf you're looking for the best pizza in NYC, I would recommend making friends with a few locals at a neighborhood bar and get their take on it-I've found that those recommendations are usually the best hidden gems on an island where pizza is not in short supply.  Grimaldi's is good...but in my opinion, not worth the hype.", "author": "Lauren F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-10", "description": "Located under the Brooklyn Bridge and serving the best crisp crusted pizza made on a coal fried brick oven.

We ended up waiting quite a while. It was probably about 20-30 min we had been waiting outside in 90 degree weather with 4 starving people thinking 3PM on a Thursday we would get in right away.  However, what was aggravating was we kept getting skipped over (we were a party of 4 and they took 2 parties of 2 and a party of 7 behind us... Apparently there wasn't a 4 top available... Wtf)   Then once we got inside, we had to wait another 5-10 min on the middle floor where we could clearly see open tables. Also, no beer at this location. Seems pretty disorganized still in the new location, will most likely not come back.

Overall Soggy/Doughy consistency, really burnt crust, tasteless pie (meatball/pepperoni/spinach combo). Its obvious, the one who prepared the pizza does not do it with heart and that he should not even be making pizzas.\n\nThe waiters can be true snobs as they have so much pride in their pizzas. One of them saw me not eating the disgusting/burnt/indigestible crust and said he was disappointed for me not eating something so \"special\" while kissing his clasped fingers. Whereas he should be paid to kiss my ass instead if he wants the tip. The snob tries to cover it up by quickly getting olive oil, tabasco and vinegar.\n\nUnfortunately it's really hard  to fix food that is already dead. Perhaps the only thing that tasted right was the Snapple Iced Tea to remedy the pizza's blandness and then Ginger Ale to remedy my stomach after eating burnt crust with oil, vinegar and tabasco.", "author": "Alex H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-16", "description": "My experience was good. I've been wanting to go to Grimaldi's for a while, but whenever I am in the neighborhood, there seems to be a extremely long line. So my solution...be there when it opens. I came with my gf and got seated immediately. What was weird was that we were sitting right next to another. Some may or may not like the proximity (don't think others coming with a larger party would have the same problem). The food came out quickly, which was a plus, but again, I was there right when it opened. The pizza was good, but I am sure I could find pizza just as good anywhere else for less hype. Then we ordered a cannoli. Ehhhh on the cannoli. Looks good, but not the best tasting.

I spent 3 hrs in line, and another hour after sitting down until I got my pizza.

There was a long line.  I stood there, thinking: \"no way is this line worth the pizza.\"  The place was so busy, my friend and I ended up splitting a table with a German couple, because a four-person table freed up and we didn't want to wait any longer.  Sum up of the story: I was wrong, the pizza was worth it.\n\nFunny addendum to the story: we were sitting next to Germans on one side, Italians on the other.  And the Germans were sitting next to some French folks.  We all got to talking.  Then the French left.  Then the Germans and the Italians ragged on the French for ten, maybe fifteen minutes, doing funny impressions of them and their snooty opinions of pizza.  It was like walking into a clich\u00e9 political cartoon.
