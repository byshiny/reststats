There were lots of healthy options on the menu as well as cheese burgers and fries, soups, sandwiches, etc.   We went the healthy route, Greek salad w chicken and a chicken Caesar wrap.  Both were delicious, the ingredients all fresh.  The coffee was very good, nice and strong and they were sure to come through to offer refills.  The service was quick and efficient .

I went to this restaurant to order a sandwich to go but before I ordered I had to use the bathroom. Mr.Ramirez had stopped me and asked me where I was going, when I told him that I was going to use the bathroom before I order, he told me to get out. I couldn't believe what just happened so I had to step out of the restaurant to calm myself down because he embarrassed me in front of other customers. I went back inside and told him that I was going to order food to go. I asked Mr.Ramirez who was the manager on duty and he said it was him, and he also said he's the owner of Clark's restaurant. The way he spoke to me was unacceptable and i'll make sure that everyone I know that works and live in Brooklyn Heights know this manager's terrible customer service.", "author": "Jared B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-24", "description": "It's got a restroom for customers, which sets it above some of the other restaurants on the block, but that's where the superiority ends.

There is not that much space and the waiters dont seem to really care.  I pointed out that it looked like someone had already taken a few sips of my water glass and they said it probably just wasnt filled to the top.  Maybe they are right, but it took a long time to get anything we asked for, even simple things like a coffee or a new glass of water, and we would have to flag down any waiter because they didnt seem to be organized, I saw other tables having similar problems.  The food was actually good and reasonably priced, so I would go back because there are just not many decent brunch options in the neighborhood.  They also have a very large menu, so there are many different things to get.", "author": "Rakesh M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-22", "description": "Best diner- owners make you feel like family.

The first few times I was lucky enough to go when they weren't busy. That is when my experience was good.\n\nThe next time, I went to breakfast with my boyfriend. He accidentally tipped over my full glass of orange juice (which is delicious- but costs a fortune). It took forever to get someone to help us clean it up. Then we asked if we could have another. It took forever just to get the second glass AND they made us pay for the spilt glass and the new one. \n\nThis was just one of many terrible experiences with the service here. Nothing against their food- that is always great. But it seems that every time someone comes to my table, it's a different waiter. I suppose they don't just stick to their zone, they wander the entire restaurant or just stand around and wait to be called over to a table. \n\nAs I am writing this review, I am currently sitting in Clark's. I've just looked at the menu noticing that any add-ons practically cost an arm and a leg. Not worth it. Also they have brought my food out almost 10 minutes before my boyfriend received his food. \n\nSo to sum it up: food costs a lot, yet is good. But the good food is overshadowed by the terrible service.", "author": "Austen M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-16", "description": "I'm not sure if this place was once called Clark Street Diner, or if I made that up. \n\nAnyway, we went for breakfast on Sunday morning. Very little wait, but the place was hopping! We were seated and helped by the same people who have been there for years. I like that kind of longevity! \n\nOrdered two breakfast special omelets, which I believe were $8.25 each. Includes coffee, OJ, and a side of toast. Not too shabby! Both omelets were great. Coffee stayed full. Little OJ was freshly squeezed. \n\nSolid place! \n\nPS- I'm told their yankee bean soup is phenomenal.", "author": "Benjamin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "Very unattentive service.

You can have breakfast all day long.  I guess thats the best part of it.  The food is just meh.  nothing sticks out.  had the blueberry sundae pancakes.  blueberries were infused in the pancakes and there were two scoops of vanilla ice cream on top of three pancakes.  plenty food for 10.50.  The syrup they served was individual kraft brand syrup in sealed containers.  Also tried the french toast and canadian bacon.

Came here with two friends on a Sunday afternoon (probably around 1pm?) and although the place was pretty packed, we were seated fairly quickly.
