Maybe it was because they were closing in 45 minutes or just amazingly efficient.  It was still warm when got it home and very tasty.  I do like their summer rolls but truth be told, if they had fried spring rolls, I would be there every day.  There's a good choice of bubble tea but I have to be in the mood and it has to be milk free.  All in all, good fast food and convenient.  This Hanco's just a half a block from the Bergen Street subway on Smith but wish they could stay open just an extra hour for us late eaters.", "author": "Wailana W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-22", "description": "Best Vietnamese sandwiches around!

Curious if I could ask for less noodles and more lettuce and veg next time. And maybe some bean sprouts.

I have never tried a tofu bahn mi before, so I was so excited to eat it!\n\nI have to say that their tofu bahn mi was fantastic, but wish there was more tofu in the sandwich. The sauce was delicious and complemented the sandwich. I also ordered the classic bahn mi, which was delicious as well (super meaty). But when comparing it to my most favorite bahn mi shop (Ba Xuyen), Hanco's didn't beat it. But nonetheless, I really enjoyed the tofu bahn mi and the classic bahn mi. If I am ever around the neighborhood, I would definitely come here to grab the tofu \u0026 classic bahn mi again.

I went to college near Westminster, CA which means amazing bahn mi's for a couple of dollars. But, my quest to find a tasty bahn mi ended up leading me to Hanco's. I think my sandwich was like $7 or $8 which is still under 10. and 5 dollars is like 10 in new york so I'll just say that it was a decent deal. \n\nThe sandwich had all kinds of meats in there, great consistency and mixture of who knows what. The sauce that's in there is really what did it for me though. Bread was crunchy and good and didn't scrape off the top of my mouth like most bahn mi's do. \n\nIt was a really good meal and I would definitely go again.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Kevin L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-14", "description": "I love a good bahn mi and when I saw the packed storefront as I walked passed, I couldn't help but stop. Tried their roast pork to go and thought it was very solid. Could have been a tad bigger but amount of pork was sufficient for the reasonable price of $7. The thai bubble tea was decent but not great. Probably a little heavy on the milk.

I've had much better pho. \nMaybe the banh mi's are better? I had the grilled chicken with beef broth noodle soup. \n\nThey kinda skimped out on the noodles and the broth was mediocre. It wasn't oily and tasted okay. The Vietnamese coffee was good! I like that it's self service so it's more efficient for everyone. \n\nHowever, I like my pho with a lot more flavor and definitely more noodles. The soup was overpriced and I've had yummier pho at a more affordable price at other restaurants.

Geez, I could've fed my family of four with this meal. The broth was tasty and the basil included gave it such a great flavor. This was my first time having Pho and I have to say I'll order this again for sure. \n\nThe place has amble space which is great.

I always order this when I'm in the area.\n\nPro-tip: When you dine in, you get a LOT more food than what fits in the to-go container. I learned that today when I decided to enjoy a late lunch here.\n\nThe vermicelli bowl is filled with cold rice noodles, a big bed of leafy greens on the bottom, jicama, carrots, cucumbers, delicious fake chicken (seriously tastes so good), crushed peanuts and garlic chips.  It comes with fish sauce which I pour all over and this bowl is seriously the tastiest thing.

I am so ridiculously full right now. I had the vermicelli salad with grilled chicken ($8.75). There was Plenty of Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Cucumber And Mint Leaves. It was then topped with Roasted Peanuts, Fried Red Onion and served with a Vinaigrette on the side.  It was so fresh and light and yet so filling. But since I am a glutton, I also ordered a classic Vietnamese Sandwich which is normally called a Bahn Mi. They take a toasted French baguette slathered it with mayo and butter. Then it stuffed with P\u00e2t\u00e9, Ham and Ground Beef and topped with thinly cut carrots, daikon, cilantro, and jalape\u00f1os.
