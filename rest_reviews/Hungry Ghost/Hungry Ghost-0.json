Once all the native establishments are replaced by stores that just price gouge for mediocre product in exchange for a naive, clown-like interpretation of what is cool, Brooklyn will be lost forever.", "author": "Eek N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-28", "description": "I stopped by here twice because I just love the coffee and lattes here. Its a pretty neat spot with great ambience for a relaxed vibe. It has ample seating and tables for you to get work done or just have casual talk with some friends. I definitely would come back just to do a little bit of studying while enjoying a great roast. \n\nI personally love any place that uses Stumptown coffee and does it right since its one of my favorite roasts so its no surprise that I love the coffee here. Its also a plus that they offer oat milk here as well which is one of my personal favorites to put in coffee. \n\nStaff here is quite friendly and will be sure to pay attention to your requests. From what I've seen, the food here is also good so next time I stop by I will give their breakfast options a try.", "author": "Phil L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-04", "description": "Horrible attitude from the staff working at this location. I don't think the manager trains the staff well or at the very least have some simple basic customer service. Nasty nasty horrendous attitude. Been a customer for many years but this is the last straw.

It's looks nice and there's seating inside as well as outside. I got an oat milk latte for about $5. It's priced about the same as any other coffee shop in the area. The latte was good.

The location is also excellent, there aren't alot of other higher end coffee shops nearby. That being said, it's definitely on the pricey side and you'll probably end up paying more than $4.", "author": "Natalie H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-24", "description": "Cheddar chive jalape\u00f1o biscuits!

Helped make my life so easy for an event I was organizing - responded immediately to my inquiry, offered to deliver pot of coffee to my building, brought all the coffee accessories I hadn't even thought of - even thought of the almond milk - and picked-up after it was over.

The coffee is delicious; I had a cookie but they also serve other food (including breakfast). It's the sort of place to come and read a book or be a typical brooklynite and write your novel.

Very nice and comfy decor. I had a blueberry muffin with a hot chai latte. Very underwhelming... the muffin was dry, left me wishing I had ordered something elsewhere.

The decaf americano is very good but my favorite thing to get is the cardomon bread ( from Ovenly) and the egg and cheese sandwich on a french roll. The cardomon bread is moist, has the right amount of sweet and has this crunch on top and that reminds of the 7 up cake my mom used to make back in the day. The egg tastes like how eggs used to taste with a little salt and pepper;  the cheese tastes like gourmet cheddar, the bread is super fresh. \n\nMohammed and other guy he works with (the guy who works in the mornings with the long braids, I didn't catch his name, thus the description), is very nice.", "author": "Stephanie C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-01-07", "description": "The coffee is still good but I still feel like the staff hates me for existing.
