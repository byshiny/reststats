Gorgeous modern interior, and beautiful presentation on the plate. I ordered delivery once, and it came in a solid 20 minutes. One Spicy Salmon roll was 12 PIECES!!!!!!!! and the mango hawaii roll is outstanding. wrapped in mango and topped with caviar. i have eaten in there at least 3 times. the lunch box is AMAZING. fresh sushi and delicious teriyaki, soft rice, appetizer, miso soup, delicious salad with jicama and cucumber and a delicious ginger dressing, and then fruit (pineapple, or strawberries, watermelon, maybe honeydew) that whole lunch box is $10!!! before the 15% discount! I love the decor and the presentation is gorgeous. The sushi fish is so fresh and i felt great after. i have never like Iron Chef and this is definitely my favorite sushi/asian fusion restaurant. Did i mention the food was cheap and AMAZING! and ps. the sushi chef used to work at world class NOBU! and brought that delicious sushi to a fair $5 a roll. Thanks Ozu. and they have these delicious Guava Japanese candies as you leave. PLEASE TRY IT! it's SOO GOOD. the service is also excellent. What a beautiful and delicious restaurant.
