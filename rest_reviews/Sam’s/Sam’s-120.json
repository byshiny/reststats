I came for soup and left happy. \n\nThis place is definitely old school. There's *no* glitz here, but there are tons of family photos around the bar. One waiter and less than a handful of cooks run the place; definitely a personal experience. He's a bit slow, but that's fine, if not a bit relieving. \n\nI usually order the pasta fagioli when I come here, and it's been good both times I've passed by. It wasn't consistent, however; the soup tasted less saucy the second time around, but the pasta itself tasted great both times. Apparently it's home-made on some days,  which must be a treat.\n\nIt's nothing special, and it's certainly no Grimaldi's or Patsy's.

The food was mediocre, but the problem was the owner/waiter.  Sense is that he is unbalanced - worse than the soup Nazi on Seinfeld episode.  Overbearing in a bad way; opinionated about things that are of no concern to him and outside of the normal ordering discourse.  He makes up his own ad hoc restrictions on what you can order.  Like wearing a straight-jacket. This is in addition to the verbiage on the top of the menu that reads something like: absolutely no substitutions or variances, else will be charged at full price (paraphrasing).  Anyway, my wife and I walked in tonight about a half hour before closing.  I tried to order a chicken Parmesan hero.  His response was that he doesn't [want to] do sandwiches in the evening - that I would have to order the full plate at nearly twice the price and I didn't want pasta.  Absolutely nothing on the menu restricts sandwiches to the time of day.  I said I'm out of here. As in the past, he was totally unapologetic - just issues orders to customers.  I've had enough of this lunatic.  If you think this review is an outlier, please take a few moments to read the other one star reviews.

I asked the owner /waiter to please cut the kid's slices into smaller pieces. He said I should do that myself and gave me a knife. (I've been to many pizza places and in 30 years, no one has ever refused to cut a slice for kids to eat) At the end of the meal I asked for the check and waited 15 minutes. When I asked again, he said \"I heard you the first time \", them made us wait another few minutes. The place wasn't even busy. I would never go back and here's why - the place isn't good  enough to have to deal with nasty, bad service.  I'm all about the food- if Roberta's, Lucali, Pauli Gs had nasty service, I'd still go there. (And they actually have good service) But this pizza is nothing special at all.

They marinate the mushrooms themselves!\nWe had the pepperoni  pizza. I've been eating pizza for over 50 years, this was probably one of the best I've had. The crust, not real thin and certainly not thick was crisp and delicious. You could have had the crust alone, with perhaps a little oil and Parmesan and been quite happy. But it was the sauce that was exceptional! Sweet yet , spiced just so. The cheese was excellent and nothing overpowered anything else.\nWe also had the baked ziti.

We ordered our pizza by phone because we had guests in town and realized the restaurant could have quite a wait (not because it is packed but because it's not run efficiently, nor is it adequately staffed).

My boyfriend and I got a pie to go (half plain, half sausage) and took a bite of the plain slice on the way home. It was so bad, we instantly decided it could not be our dinner.

Really, like inferior to Sbarro's. I am not trying to be a hater; I really mean this. Save your money.

Best pizza in NY? it's good. I'll say that. I prefer it to 9 out of 10 pizzas in the state. The difference here is the crust. Delicious crust. Same luscious smoky sweet as Di Fara's. \n\nSooo old school. I wouldn't count on freshness being a part of their integrity, but I trust whatever is comes canned to taste good. The place reminds me of the Fratelli Brother's restaurant in Goonies. I was going to go to the back to pee but then I think I heard echos of Sloth and so I held it. I think it's just the old wood and dusty lights, but the place seems cavernous. I can just imagine their storage chest and freezer now... \n\nPizza prices are elusive. We were charged 20 for the pie and 5 for a sausage add-on. Next time I would like to choose anchovies or escargot as the topping. Have you ever noticed that on TV they always order anchovies??? but in real life NO ONE orders anchovies? They should. Anchovies are great. They are mainly just salty bits. Once you get past the fact that they are a fish, they are awesome. Try putting salt on your pizza - that's usually pretty good. Now try anchovies. try it. try it. \n\nYou might be disgusted because the old waiter hasn't been bothered with hygiene since the 70's. Instead of inquiring about that, I asked him, \"What makes the pizza so good?\" \n\"Well, we'eve been making pizza since 1959.\"\nAnd they've been open since 1930. What were they doing in the interim? Making the sign I guess, because it's hard to notice that they are a pizzeria and not a steakhouse from the Steak Chops signage.

Sue me. And on that note, why does the Yelp population put that place over? This is thin crust Brooklyn pizza we are talking about. Once it's perfected, there is no reason to shop around. And Sam's pie is simply perfection.\n\nIf you've ever visited this place on a weekday night, there is a very good chance Louie has served you (or harassed you a bit). The man may be a bit much at times, but it's clear he has a tremendous amount of pride about his establishment . And that simply cannot be criticized.  As told by Louie, Sam's has been in his family for over 75 years. He was actually raised in the apartment above the restaurant and  has worked there basically ever since. Chat him up when you visit. He has a million stories about the real Carroll Gardens.\n\nBut onto the food. I'm going to say this once, bless Louie's little heart, but the non-pizza entrees are below average. Don't even try the pasta. It's bland and unnecessarily filling. The Sam's salad is a passable antipasta and includes provolone, salami and roasted pepper on a bed of iceburg. Order one for a table of 4 (even if Louie tells you to order 2). After all, you have to save room for the pie.\n\nAnd onto the pie. As noted, the restaurant has been around for over 75 years, and if you subscribe to the idea that an old pizza oven cooks better pizza, they don't come much older. I typically will order one large veg/cheese and one large pepperoni, which feeds 4 just fine. Ok, it's a shit ton of pizza and you won't want to stop. So be prepared to be stuffed. \n\nThe pie is always the perfect temp (molten and liquidy for the first 5 minutes, so be patient; steaming and gooey soon after and ready to serve). The sauce is magic. Just the right tomato, sweetness and spice combination. And the cheese is top-grade. Nice fatty mozzarella. The meat is also top-grade and presumably procured from one of the local butchers (will have to ask Louie next time).\n\nSam's is cash only, so come prepared. And price wise, it's not terribly cheap ($17 bucks for a large pie), but time is money and who doesn't want a Lombardi's or Grimaldi's caliber pie without the annoying wait?", "author": "emcee b."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-28", "description": "Still Old Schoolin' it in Brooklyn.
