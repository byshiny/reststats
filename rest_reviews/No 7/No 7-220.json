Looked it up on Yelp and saw 3.5 stars. That's never a good sign. \n\nThis is not your typical brunch fare, and that's fine. I get they're trying to be creative and veer beyond the usual pancakes, eggs and bacon for breakfast thing, but the food just wasn't good.\n\nI had the fried broccoli and egg sandwich which I really wanted to be good, it could have been good! But it was cold, the eggs looked like they were microwaved and fried broccoli had the taste of old deep fryer oil that you would find at a grimy Chinese restaurant. The other thing that annoyed me was how unfocused the menu was. I wanted to try a couple of things but I couldn't find anything that could pair even remotely well with anything else. My boyfriend got the pork and egg buns and it looked like play food - like Pre-School kitchen set play food. Looks aside, he did not like.\n\nThis review may not be entirely fair, because I was reeeeally craving the pancakes, eggs and bacon, so No. 7, I'm sorry for being resentful. But I just don't think you got this right. I wouldn't oppose trying out the dinner to give a second chance, but there are many better places in the area where I'd prefer to waste my dollars.", "author": "Rachel P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-07", "description": "Fried broccoli, egg and cheese sandwich - this is a good idea!

I had high hopes for No. 7, because I've been trying to find my go-to bar in Ft. Greene for years now. My boyfriend and I dropped in one night for a night cap. \n\nOn a positive note, the bar is beautiful and the place has a swanky vibe. \n\nHowever, our bartender was inattentive and unfriendly, borderlining on rude. It seemed like he actively didn't want us there. I don't expect much hospitality, but I find it odd when bartenders/ servers are aggressively unfriendly. If he had acted a little bit differently, we would have had more drinks and would have tipped him more. \n\nIf I want a nightcap, I'll probably go to my new favorite, Dick and Jane, instead.", "author": "M.

I was visiting from out of town, so was sort of excited to try a new bar out in Brooklyn.  Walked in, sat at the bar, ordered two drinks from the black male bartender with the Washington Nationals baseball cap on, so far so good.\n\nBut then my friend realized she ordered the wrong drink, so she told the bartender, who seemed annoyed by the fact that she wanted to switch her drink out without being charged.  But he finally agreed to switch out the drinks.  I knew he would be annoyed a bit but isn't it your job to not show that outwardly?  I think it is.  Or to just simply say you have to charge for two drinks.  Seems simple to me.\n\nSecond hiccup.  Friend asked for water because her drink is too spicy, the same bartender says yes he will get the water.  But proceeds to go speak to other customers taking other drink orders.  The comes back right in front of us and makes like 3 drinks.  Since this was extremely rude, I asked him-are you going to get her drink?  He says yes but he has to make these other drinks first.

It's a generically lovely space (pretty tiles, high ceilings with generous skylights, distressed-wood fake windows). I wasn't all that impressed with my dinner experience the first time (the fried broccoli appetizer and bean dip accompaniment for the bread far outshone all the entrees I tried that night between my eight dining companions), but I was willing to give it another chance for that all-important meal, Sunday brunch.\n\nMy girlfriend enjoyed the grits, which came with separate small bowls of fried hominy, maitake mushrooms (or more precisely, one giant mushroom), broccoli, and a poached egg. Dumping all these into the cheesy grits, she found that each bite offered a differently flavorful combination of these ingredients. Her salted potatoes were a disappointment -- expecting something interesting, she received instead a small bowl of rose and white potatoes boiled in salted water and sitting in melted butter. Eh. \n\nMy french toast was disappointing. Consisting of four small pieces (no crusts), the toast was not eggy, but definitely super-sweet. I speculate that perhaps sweetened soy milk was involved (something I remembered from my vegan brunch-making days). Three sauces accompanied the toast in three small bowls. The coconut chantilly was negligibly coconutty, and the passion fruit syrup made an already sweet piece of toast aaaachingly sweet. The savory hummus cut this sweetness, and was my favorite of the three, but even this combination got boring after a while. (The hummus, by the by, tasted more like sesame than chickpea.)\n\nOne of my more adventurous brunch companions ordered the cinnamon raisin shrimp toast -- two small pieces of triangle-cut toast sprinkled with dried shrimp and further breaded in panko flakes and deep fried, served with a small bowl of Old Bay broth with a few brussel sprouts and a poached egg and another small bowl of white rice. She was decidedly unimpressed: the toast was not discernibly cinnamon-y, nor raisin-y, and the shrimp only occasionally tasted through the overpowering panko crust. It didn't seem to her that the cinnamon raisin toast or shrimp added anything to the dish; rather, such ingredients seemed more arbitrarily \"daring\" than substantially flavorful.\n\nAlthough nothing about the food particularly offended me, I was not charmed either. (The service was wonderful, prompt and polite.)

I feel that that's the result of the ego of the chef and disrespectful to the diner. I'm all for experimenting but some of their dishes are absolutely inedible because of this. \n\nAnd stick with wine or a simple cocktail. Their cocktail \"specials\" are dreadful. Again, overdoing the \"daring\" combo schtick and ending up with something that tastes more like Robitussin than a solid drink.", "author": "Jane D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-05", "description": "I have eaten here twice. The first time the meal was excellent, I was not yelping at the time so I did not submit a review. \n\nI had one of the best meals ever at No. 7 over the weekend. It was absolutely incredible from start to finish. \n\nWe ordered the fried broccoli and cold octopus, but after chatting with the owner changed the cold octopus to the special appetizer. Panko Breaded Soft Boiled Egg, with Pork Belly and Arugula!  It was one of the most tasty and interesting dishes I have ever had. The fried broccoli was excellent as well. \n\nFor Dinner we ordered the Grilled Wagyu Bavette Steak yuzu-chili gnocchi, escarole, edamame, blueberries (copy pulled from the menu) which was excellent and tender with unique flavors! We also had the special, grass feed Australian lamb chops encrusted with herbs and quinoa. This was the best lamb I have ever tasted! EVER!\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and the owner suggested a different bottle that would go better with the lamb and steak. He was right it was a excellent choice. We finished with grappa.

The place is adorable, with an open air kitchen, swanky bar, and chill lounge area in the front. The back dining area is a bit of a surprise: it's this sparse, white, U-shaped area with a few skylights that contrasts sharply with the rest of this dark, moody restaurant. Still, I imagine it must be really pleasant during the day and would love to return for brunch!\n\nThe restaurant is kind of hidden but, if you take the C train to Lafayette, you need only turn directly to your left to enter. The warm bread, served with butter bean puree, was addictive. I honestly could have eaten two or three more servings but settled for the delightful half-pickled cucumbers that also came gratis. The boyfriend and I also split an appetizer of fried broccoli, similar to tempura, but with a much more chewy, breaded outside. No. 7 is big on purees and served with the broccoli is a tasty black bean puree that I would not hesitate to order again. \n\nThe menu is very sparse, and if my memory serves correctly, there were only four appetizers and four entrees. My boyfriend loved his scallops while I was extremely impressed with my grilled sirloin. Very tender, I was very surprised that my generous cut of meat could taste that amazing! It was literally perfection. The only pitfall of our meal were my kimchi pierogies that I had heard so much about. They tasted a bit overcooked. \n\nLow markup on drinks mean that I would not hesitate to come back for drinks. My cocktail was phenomenal and served in a very cute pitcher/glass.

I ate so much that I'm still full the next morning. Uncomfortable, but unavoidable.\n\nStarted off with the fried broccoli. Delish! I was worried it might be too salty, but no such thing. Very rich. The greens with dill and grapefruit were a super counterpoint...refreshing. Honestly could have just eaten the fried broccoli for dinner, as it was a pretty large plate.\n\nBy this time I was already full on broc and the tasty cucumbers and bread (with white bean butter sauce stuff for dipping), but here comes the main dish. Roasted chicken...that is, pork loin-style 'medallions' of chicken wrapped in crusty skin. Wha?! Tasty. The brussel sprouts were really awesome. And pour truffle oil on anything and you've got me. The portions were huge, and I'm a big eater.\n\nMy girlfriend had the scallops, which were giant and delish.\n\nThe waiter, Charles, was awesome.

Bar in the front with a woodsy warm feeling.  And seating in the back with some small windows that let some light through.\n\nWe sat in the back area and immediately ordered the hot Brandy Apple Cider.  Deeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious.  I wanted to order another one but decided it might be best to take it easy.\n\nI ordered the Catfish \u0026 Braised Pork Cheeks w/ two fried eggs, collard greens, soggy fritos ($14).  It was a relatively big portion of stew with the fried eggs on top.  It tasted pretty good, but I could only eat half of it because it was way too salty.  I'm a HUGE salt lover, too, so, trust me, if \"I\" think it's too salty, it's definitely way too salty.  Not only should they put less salt into this dish, they should really also serve it with some bread or rice.  It would balance out the meal nicely.\n\nMy friend ordered the Butternut Grits w/ broccoli, maitake mushrooms, swiss, fried hominy, poached egg ($11).  FYI that the swiss cheese was layered over the top of the grits much like french onion soup.  The broccoli and maitake mushrooms were in a small side dish, and they arrived cold.  We're still not exactly sure if they were supposed to be cold.  The poached egg came in another side dish, and my friend just dumped it into the grits.  Again, she complained of the saltiness, and she's also a huge salt lover.\n\nSo I think the overall takeaway from my 1st visit at No. 7 is that the dishes themselves are super salty but the drinks are awesome.  I'll probably give it another chance to see if I have a better food experience next time.  \n\nIn the meantime, it's great to end the meal with a huge slice of the best red velvet cake in NY from Cake Man Raven across the street!", "author": "JaShin T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-07", "description": "Yay I'm a fan! lol  I had the General Tso's Filet O Fish Sandwich, and I was sold.

After all, we do live only a block away:) This CUTE Brooklyn restaurant in the heart of Fort Greene definitly deserves 5 stars.\n\nFrom the food to the service - we had such a good experience. We shared the fried broccoli which is definitly something just to try if you've never had it. Ricky got the steak and while eating says (and I quote) \"this is one of the best steaks I've had in a long long time...\" - and he loooooves steak! I got the pecan crusted tofu and I was a bit hesitant to order it because I find that tofu can taste very bland if not seasoned well, but this was unlike anything I've ever had.

For the latter reason it is a great place to get drinks, if you can find a place to sit or stand. It tends to be pretty crowded around the bar, but well worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood.  If it weren't for these qualities I would probably give it two stars instead of three.\n\nI haven't been for brunch, but have visited for dinner three times (and ordered from both the bar and the regular menu) and each time I was pleased in some ways and disappointed in others.  First off, their bean dip with bread and marinated cucumbers is excellent, and a perfect substitute for the usual bread and butter offering as the beans are quite buttery.  Their fried broccoli appetizer--an entire head of broccoli fried whole--is displeasing in that it is difficult to eat and bland.  My dining partner ordered the fried egg appetizer and found the tomato sauce to be lacking in flavor and felt that it did not compliment the rest of the dish very well.  I had the frisee salad and there just isn't very much to say about it--not bad, not great.\n\nThe catfish sandwich was incredibly messy as it was completely smothered in a sauce which tasted like Soy Vay and lots and lots of Sriracha--the broccoli mayo did not work well with the other sauce.  However, the entree I ordered on my first visit, the arctic char with brussel sprouts, celery root, and lychee (which is no longer on the menu, probably due to the season) was absolutely delicious.

It is not \"hipster\", but it is representative of Brooklyn's \"New Guard\" (as I call it) - the mid-twenties-to-thirties professionals who have been gentrifying the Fort Greene/Clinton Hill/Bed-Stuy area of the borough for the past ten years or so.  The conversations are lively and the clothes fit well and the bar is very nearly packed if not absolutely crowded on any given night.  In fact, the last time that I had a chance at finding a seat at the bar (or the coveted window seat) was during the first few weeks of the restaurant's opening.\n\nThat being said, the restaurant seems very promising from the outside; that is quite often a very good sign, however, in this case, it may prove to be quite the opposite.\n\nBefore I first dined at No.7, I was not aware of Chef Tyler Kord (formerly of Perry St), whose name has been surfacing in many food blogs for quite some time now as his influence has spurned No7 Sub and other projects that seem to be popping up all over Manhattan.  During my initial visit, I noticed the worn-looking curly haired mess that is Kord frantically commanding the other chefs in the exposed kitchen and it brought back memories of my childhood, as he reminded me of hip-but-gritty looking future art school kids that were often my friends' older cousins in a small working class town in northeastern Pennsylvania.  Adding to this comparison was the fact that just a few weeks prior to writing this review, I stood behind Kord in line at the nearby market and noticed that he was either working very hard or hadn't taken a shower in a few days as his curls of hair were very greasy as he purchased a pack of cigarettes and proceeded to pack them by rapidly tapping the top of the box with his hand (again a reminder of rough-and-tumble types of northeastern Pennsylvania) prior to paying.  Kord can also often be seen smoking cigarettes in front of the restaurant quite often; I'm not sure if this image is repulsive or enticing.\n\nThe comparison's to my Pennsylvania upbringing didn't end there.  The beer menu's selections follow the pattern of a small well-chosen variety seemingly balanced by one inexpensive \"American\" selection.  Genesee Cream Ale was the first of the inexpensive offerings that No.7 offered and it is a fine beer and one that was a perennial favorite among my Pennsylvania friends' fishing and hunting enthusiast fathers and uncles.  A few months later the restaurant switched in Wilkes-Barre's very own Lionshead Pilsner which was both touching and disturbing for me as I probably consumed \"enough for everyone\" in college, as a 24-bottle case of it cost $10.60 in the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area circa 2005, though at No.7 circa 2010 it commanded the shocking-but-not-shocking-for-NYC price of $5 per draught.\n\nThe restaurant also offers a small cocktail list and this is really hit or miss as I have had a few cocktails that were very original and refreshing and others that were mediocre at best.  Unfortunately I can't remember the details of the ones I consumed but I do remember a gin and cucumber combination that was particularly pleasing and a grape-infused variety that was quite a hit with anyone that I brought to the restaurant.  Over the course of a few visits, I have also found that the quality varies with the bartenders.  I don't know if he still works there, but I can recall short and stocky tattooed gentleman who manned the bar during the daytime hours who proceeded to state his case for classic cocktails when responding to our request for an opinion of the cocktail menu by stating, \"Well, I like things like the sidecar, Manhattan, old-fashioned, etc.\"  I tried one of his sidecars and it was not a sidecar as I knew it in the classic sense but some sort of cherry-infused potion that was admittedly not bad but also made me wonder if he had any idea what he was talking about.  \n\nThe food at No.7 is where things get truly interesting.  Chef Tyler Kord seems to be eager to offer \"alternative\" ingredients but present them in a manner which seems to make an attempt at innovation while nodding at the traditional (I suppose that this is the essence of \"New American\" after all).  \n\nMy first dinner experience at No.7 was very positive. as I had the fried broccoli appetizer which, it should be noted, at this point I believe to be the highlight of Kord's work, as it features a large bunch of broccoli florets covered in a delicious crunchy fried coating that maintains a creaminess underneath it.  It also includes a swath of black bean sauce with a dill and a grapefruit arrangement that goes even further to expertly compliment it.

Rancid, strong, disgusting cleaning products with just a dash of wet sponge aroma thrown in for good measure.  Maybe the staff is there all the time that they don't notice how bad it is.  I'm not saying it has to smell like fresh baked bread or mulled apple cider, but I would also prefer not to gag when I'm contemplating what I want to eat for brunch.\n\nThe last time we went there I ordered this chicken broccoli enchilada.  I guess it's my own fault for ordering something that didn't sound so great, but when I got it, I was so confused that someone could have thought of this concoction and thought it sounded good - it was like, a Chinese/Mexican abomination on a plate.  The flavors were just so incongruous and weird that I was wondering who even in their most experimental would think this is a good idea.  I got a few bites in and just could not go on - it was that bad.  They were nice enough to serve me something else, but still - ick. \n\nThis morning, my husband's pancakes were extremely undercooked.  There were only a few other diners there, and we hadn't been waiting long - it would have been no big deal at ALL to wait an extra three minutes for the dish to actually be cooked properly - what is the rush people?  How about a little QC?  We told the waitress about this because I was concerned about my husband eating undercooked eggs, but the waitress just shrugged it off and was generally pretty dismissive about the whole thing.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible smell, awful food and abysmal service, the music  made me feel like I was standing in a frat house basement in 2003.

Customer service was AMAZING. Hands down. Everyone, from the hostesses, to the manager, to the servers and bartenders were so friendly and accommodating and well, Fort Green-y. We ended up having to wait quite awhile for a table (some group that decided to camp out looooong after their bill was paid), so they provided our (fairly sizable) group with complementary champagne. Really not necessary as we were enjoying our complex, tasty mixed drinks at the bar (concord grape, bourbon, and limoncello; rye, cucumber, and thyme), but definitely appreciated. They also threw in some pork tacos (WOW. So tender, tangy) and the fried broccoli (buttery, glorious) on the house as well.  \n\n2. Food is always so complex and fun. A smattering of flavor profiles and cuisines that are delicious without being overwrought. The brunch menu is unlike any I've had... particularly the Korean-style cinnamon-raisin shrimp toast (sounds bizarre, but so worth trying), and braised pork cheeks with water chestnuts in a stew with a soft boiled egg.
