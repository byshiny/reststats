I believe it's the only one of the three where pastries are actually baked on site, and if you get lucky with timing you can get some warm and fresh from the oven :)\n\nRecommended:\n-Walnut croissant ($4.25) - the walnut filling is not overly sweet and has good texture with some solid walnut pieces inside. It's not twice-baked yet the interior of the croissant is somehow still nice and light. You can still taste the yeasty flavor of the dough even with the sweet filling, which I really enjoyed.\n-Croissant ($3.50) - one of the top 3 croissants in NYC in my opinion (after L'imprimerie and the now-closed KarV\u00e9r/Payard). It looks gorgeous and is super flaky outside. The inside is a bit on the chewy/greasy side, but it's still reasonably light. I didn't eat the ends, which were extremely hard, dry, and crunchy, but overall it was still enjoyable.\n-Baklava croissant ($4.50) - I got one of these fresh from the oven so that may have skewed my impression, but I really liked this. It wasn't the most texturally light or croissant-like, but it was still crispy and flaky and delicious. It has both lemon and pistachio inside, and it's not overly sweet or too syrupy.\n\nOK:\n-Kouign amann ($3.25) - it's ok but not my favorite KA in the city. The texture is more bready and chewy, and the caramelized bottom was too sticky and stick-in-your-teeth for me personally.\n\nPastries I've tried from some of Pain D'Avignon's other locations:\n-Hazelnut croissant ($4) - has a chocolate hazelnut filling. The one I tried (from the location in the Plaza) was not fresh, so the ones here might be better, but I liked the walnut croissant more.\n-Pistachio chocolate escargot ($3.75) - the pistachio filling was good but the pastry I tried was pretty hard (not in a crisp way).\n-Almond croissant ($3.75) - not bad but not as good as the walnut croissant. The filling is smooth and not overly sweet, but overall it was on the dry side to me.\n-Coconut chocolate croissant (black and white croissant) ($4.75) - this is a chocolate croissant with coconut cream. The filling is good and not too sweet, but the white chocolate on top was very sweet. The chocolate dough looks visually impressive but I found it bitter and salty rather than chocolatey.", "author": "Lena J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-29", "description": "I've only ever been here for two things and that is their coffee, and their walnut croissant. \nI'm a simple guy, when I see Stumptown roasters, I do not hesitate to buy a cup of coffee or latte. I mean can you blame me? The roast is just amazing and I've never been disappointed with any place that serves this roast and this place was no different so I recommend anyone who appreciates good coffee to come here.\n\nThe walnut croissant here blew me away. Perfectly buttery and flaky with a great essence of the walnut flavor. Almond croissants are usually my go-to but I think I found a new one! Give this place a shot when you stop by Dekalb", "author": "Phil L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-23", "description": "I was minding my own business, having just placed my order at Katz's which is directly across from this bakery, but their naughty little display of breads and pastries will lure the purest of souls, and I got sucked into their vortex of carbohydrate sex!  Never mind the sandwiches, quiches, and scones, I immediately gravitated towards the slices of loaf breads.  On this particular morning last weekend, they had Chocolate Olive Oil ($5), Lemon Olive Oil ($5), and a hybrid croissant bread pudding loaf ($6), though I felt the prices were a bit steep, it is seldom that I come to Albee Square and obviously Dekalb Market Hall, so I decided to get the choc and lemon to share with my hubs.  These loaf slices are not for the faint of heart!  They are dense and heavy, like a brick, but so damn delicious, it will make you a believer.  I have to say the chocolate olive oil loaf was out of this world.  It was so moist but not at all greasy, and the chocolate was not sweet or bitter, and just right.  The dusting of cocoa powder and that sprinkling dash of sea salt were perfection and I fell head over heels for it.  This loaf is similar to the Brooklyn Blackout cake from Ovenly bakery (another favorite of mine).  The lemon loaf was also great, but I think it could have upped the lemon flavor, and for some reason, this slice did seem a little greasier than the chocolate one.  \n\nIn the end, I'm convinced this one slice of chocolate olive oil loaf cake was truly one of the best baked goods I've ever eaten.  And, I can't emphasize enough just how masterful that dusting of cocoa powder atop the whole thing was for me, because it just knocked it out of the park!", "author": "Jennifer C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-17", "description": "I occasionally find myself wandering around Dekalb Market Hall in the mornings, and Cafe D'Avignon:\n\n1. Is one of the only stands open at that time.\n2. Is the source of that delicious, buttery aroma that wafts around the entire floor. \n\nYou're not going to be sad about the croissants, the quiches, the cookies, the croques...but if there's one thing that I keep coming back to, it's the kouign-amann. If you've never had one, it is a magnificent mix of butter, pastry, and sugar, and it will singlehandedly make you fat. \n\nBut it's worth it, and the lady who hands it to me in the mornings is comfortingly just as bad at pronouncing it as I am.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-06-01", "description": "Ever since this place opened, it has been my favorite go to spot. Starting from the croissants to the cappuccinos. I love the coffee drinks from select baristas, especially from one of the female employees that has been there for a long time, maybe that is why. However, with plenty of new employees it seems that not everyone is meeting the proper standards of hygiene. I have noticed that a particular employee has been lacking proper hygiene which is not attractive to the business. He does not have a pleasant smell. Keeping hair properly put together, being clean and neat in the workspace, as well as smelling properly is essential to attracting customers to a business. I have been there with other friends and they have noticed the same issue. On any other day, I would have rated this spot 5 stars.", "author": "Raquel H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-12-05", "description": "Kudos for being open at 9am on a Monday but if you are charging $8 for a breakfast sandwich you better make it good!

The offer a pretty wide variety of classic French pastries, sandwiches, and coffees.  In my one visit, I tried the Croque Monsieur.  It checked all of the boxes in terms of ingredient list, but seemed awfully reliant on butter and the bechemel sauce, which made for a greasy, heavy affair (a bit too much so when you have to go back to work).

A short line of early birds waiting to get their breakfast savories, pastries, and coffee - and delicious they all are! My smoked salmon bun was heated up in the back, melting the whipped dill cream cheese and toasting the brioche bun to just the right degree of flakiness.

I've been to Essex St location, this location seems more substantial. \n\nThe folks here are the baking up some fine French pastries inside the Dekalb Market Hall.

I was thrilled to learn they have the difficult to master kougie amann on the menu, (for only $3.50!) and got the original and a fig and goat cheese version. I started in on the original and found that it was quite unlike the other versions of this pastry I've had around the city. There was no custard-y inside, but just flaky pastry dough kind of baked to death on top of some sugar that had caramelized, then candied, and pooled at the bottom for a pull-your-fillings-out kind of experience. I took a few bites and decided it just wasn't worth continuing. Mom picked it up and I honestly warned her about the caramel stuff- she wasn't really too much of a fan either. Then I ate the fig and goat cheese one- this one was much closer to what I expected from the first. The killer for me with this was it was savory- dusted not with decorators sugar but kosher salt. There were also disappointingly few digs inside. But if they could get their original to this shape/consistency/inner goodness, I'd be a fan. Or if they added sugar to the fig and goat cheese. Overall not a place I'm in a rush to visit again.", "author": "April H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-22", "description": "I'm a big foodie and eat almost all my meals out so def know when I've found a hidden gem.
