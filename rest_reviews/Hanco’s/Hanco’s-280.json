Moral of the story---you can't get banh mi past mi.\n\nReally its 4.5 stars because it is expensive for banh mi standards. I guess its okay if its for the best banh mi in all of Brooklyn and prob Manhattan and Queens. The boba/bubble tea are a grade above the stuff you find in Chinatown. \n\nThe place is a little hole in the wall off Bergen and is run by a friendly/rowdy bunch of Chinese people. The pork chop and classic are the ones you have to try, they also have veggie options. \n\nBetter than the one on 7th from what I hear.

No matter where I am, I start to subconsciously wander in the direction of Hanco's.  Before I realize what has happened, I am inside eating a delicious Vietnamese sandwich, listening to their surprisingly pleasant emo-pop playlist, sipping a sweet and creamy Vietnamese coffee.  I look around and see all walks of human life are inside enjoying the food - from after school brats who just order rice, to stuffy, older yoga women with their purple mats sticking out of their tote bags.  There I sit (the basically unemployed freelance slacker) who slurps his Shredded Chicken Pho soup while watching the snow fall quietly onto Smith Street (on such a winter's day).", "author": "TJ N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-06", "description": "I gotta admit Hanco's is pretty cool. For instance, take their grilled chicken banh mi, the baguettes are lightly buttered, overstuffed with authentic pickled pickles/carrots/ cilantro and mayo...you got yourself a perfect meal!  The baguette just hits the spot, the bread is soft and warm unlike other Viet baguettes that are pretty dry and flaky. And the green tea is not too sweet or bland. Hub always goes for their traditional classic while I stick with my adventurous route. You'll def taste the difference in quality from the marinated stuffing, meat, and baguette itself.", "author": "Linda W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-07", "description": "Grilled pork sandwich 10/10.

No mayonnaise. The \"pork\" is chewy and delicious. The veggies are sweet and crisp.

They have great bubble tea (the passion fruit, mango and milk green tea are my favs). Their sandwiches are so good as well as their protein bowl (grilled chicken and pork are my favorite-I get that all the time). Very wonderful place. Decent seating too + their seamless delivery is always on time with no problems in the food. My tip eating here would be - Get the extra meat for $3. It's worth it. So very much all the worth it.

I asked for a grilled tofu this time, wanting to avoid pork and meat for one day.  I know, what was I thinking??\nThe soft, chewy bread with a buttery crunchy exterior, filled with (extra) spicy tofu and fresh pickled vegetables.  This sandwich hits the spot every time, and I always say I want bubble tea but everyone who knows me knows I have issues with drinking (nonalcoholic) calories.  If someone would go have lunch with me there...then we could split both.

So, for my wife and I, it is strictly a grab-and-dash affair... but we have sat there for lunch/dinner once or twice. The space is decent and clean and the atmosphere is good, if you do manage to snare that open table. Now, let's get to the important part - the grub. I like Hanco's a lot but I don't love it. Bear in mind that coming from the west coast, my bar is set pretty high for what constitutes amazing Pacific Rim food. It's in our dining DNA, like knowing great Italian fare is a birthright for a native New Yorker. So I might be a harder critic than is entirely fair.\n\nWhat does Hanco's do well? They make good banh mi (called Vietnamese Sandwiches on the menu). We've had the Classic, Grilled Chicken, Sardine, and Grilled Pork several times. Of the four, I think the Grilled Pork is the weakest. It is just OK. The other three are quite good - particularly the Classic and the Grilled Chicken. On the menu, you'll see the Classic has p\u00e2t\u00e9, ham, and ground pork. It sounds scary but - trust me - it tastes way better than it sounds and it isn't the gut-busting bomb you might imagine it to be. The flavors play off each other well (especially against the pickled veggies). The combination of flavors leaves you thinking \"what is this?\" because it really doesn't taste like ham or p\u00e2t\u00e9 at all... in fact you may even forget it is mostly pork. The french bread foundation of the sandwiches is generally good but there have been a couple of times when it was a bit too hard and left us feeling it was day-old not fresh.\n\nThe other really solid choices on the menu are the Rice Vermicelli Salad (the grilled shrimp is my fave), and the staggering array of teas and flavored or milk bubble teas. You can't go wrong on that side of the menu, truly.\n\nWhere Hanco's is a letdown is in their Pho Noodle Soup. I don't know exactly what it is - maybe they use a canned broth or add a bland nuoc mam (fish sauce) to it - but the result is the same. Their soup lacks the 'personality' or lick-the-bowl addictiveness of a really good pho. They have the ingredients but the 'oomph' just isn't there. It tastes like any beef or chicken soup with a few 'exotic' veggies thrown in. \n\nSo, if you go to Hanco's - try the sandwiches and hit the bubble tea but skip the pho.", "author": "Justin L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-11", "description": "The sandwiches at hancos are a great healthy alternative to fast food.

The neighborhood is really cool and there is a really classy ice cream shop next door that I wanted to try, after leaving Hanco's I just had no room.\nWe had the classic and the shredded chicken, extra spicy, sooo good.
