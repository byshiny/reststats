It was super speedy (arrived earlier than predicted on the app) and was super tasty. We did pepperoni with pineapple and the lasagna pizza. Only downside is that no red pepper or Parmesan was included. It was a bit of a downer since we all like those! I would've been willing to pay extra for those if that was the case, if that had been an option on the ordering app.", "author": "Casandra S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-16", "description": "They have an excellent slice.   It's always done just right and the taste is delicious.   As New York pizzerias go this one is excellent.  There are No-frills just delicious New York style Pie.

Missed just once and was mad the whole way home.  I told the guys that thier pizza is the standard by which we measure quality of pizza against. Only 2 have come close, one in DC and one in Queens. That is it, Not Rays Pizza is the cream of the crop, after this review getting ready to eat a couple slices we brought back to VA .  We always get a large pie with extra cheese , one 1/2 Pepperoni- and we have never been let down.  The crust is superb, not too thick, not too thin, just right and done to perfection. The cheese is the best, cannot get the taste anywhere else, mixed with the sauce is a Homerun. Just cannot say enough about that first bite, always burn the roof of my mouth because I cannot wait for it to cool. The Garlic Knots are the best, loaded with Garlic and explode in your mouth with not to be found elsewhere flavor. The crew are always friendly, really make u feel like a regular even if not. The place has plenty of seating for a NY Pizzeria and very clean \u0026 updated restroom. The best place to get an authentic slice of NY.", "author": "James M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-18", "description": "For a classic pizza joint their crust is delicious!

The staff has always been nice, courteous, fast, and efficient. \n\nNice variety of slices, you want something light \nget a regular slice, sicilian they even have a veggie slice which i swear by, and if your trying to leave out of there wobbling go for the stuffed meat slice  \n\nThe place is very clean, always has been as long as ive been going there and they have about 5 tables seating 3 people. \n\nIf you're in the neighborhood or passing by and hungry definitely check this place out.", "author": "Desire W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-19", "description": "Nice local pizza joint in brooklyn, pizza was fresh and tasty.

The venue layout is similar to any pizza spot , only difference is the clean and catering to customers. It's not suitable for big groups but they have seating for small groups.

The pizza is pretty average but I kicked it up to 4 stars for the variety and the staff was friendly. The toppings were great and flavor was there. Where they lost me was the crust. I like a more \"chewy\" crust. Theirs was of average thickness and came out crispy. It's middle of the road crust. Not choosing any sides crust. Some people I'm sure are into this.

Well before anyone artisanal'd pizza at ridiculous prices, Not Ray's has been busting out pies and slices for the people for years. \n\nOne Sunday a month I host a workmates dinner at my place. And because almost everyone is has some sort of allergy, I hedge my bets as best as I can with the menu. I am neither a nutritionist, nor a scientist, nor Gwynneth Paltrow, so I do my best and throw together a few vegan salads/veg sides, a respectable cheese board and some sort of charcuterie plate with vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free options and have some fancy pints of dairy-based and vegan ice cream for dessert. \n\nY'all. I try to be the thoughtful co-worker. And I think I'm doing ok as no one has yet to roll out of my place on a stretcher into an ambulance. \n\nMy go-to delivery main is the Not Ray's gluten-free cheese pizza. I order a few smalls, with cheese and without. Read more for the explanation why, re size and re cheese.\n\nThings to know: \n\n1) Not Ray's gluten-free pizza crust is pre-made. I've ordered all the sizes but the \"small\" works best as it crisps up like a cracker--this is a science-math moment that has to do with volume/mass/heat but I failed physics in high school. So. What I will say is this: think \"bar pizza\" for a reference point. Also, mitigate expectations: it's suuuuuuuuper important not to expect a Lucali-moment. Rather, ask for a well-done pie and you will will be happy. Who doesn't love a crunchy, tomato-y main, that can be held in one's hand as one freaks out re: work deliverables? (Folks allergic to nightshades. That's who. But one cannot win them all. As Game of Thrones so aptly demonstrates.)\n\n2) For the vegan guests, ask for no-cheese and fresh/dried herbs. The in-take order person will, I guarantee, be rolling her/his eyes BUT you be you! and do it. What you'll get is a crispy, tomato-y, herby loveliness, with dried oregano, marjoram or maybe even fresh basil, which you can then gussy up with your own good olive oil and fancy olives, arugula, nooch http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/05/nutritional-yeast-dont-be-afraid_n_5628501.html, etc.\n\n3) For everyone else, ask for your pies with light/little cheese. If you don't you will get A LOT OF CHEESE. It's true. Some folks like their cheese. As such, maybe just order one of the pies \"regular\" for those who like A LOT OF CHEESE. \n\nThe Not Ray's small gluten-free cheese pizza has six slices. For a party of two, I recommend one pizza, because you have a bunch of other stuff on the table, unless your dinner guest is a tri-athlete or you don't have a bunch of other stuff on the table. Then get two pizzas. \n\nFor a party of eight, get five pizzas. You know you have a co-worker or two or five that never cook and will be making sad-puppy-eyes at the end of the meeting and you'll send slices home. This will ensure your position in workplace dynamics. Srsly. Free pizza, even gluten-free pizza, is money. Bank it. And pull them favors in.", "author": "Pritha R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-27", "description": "Crisp crust and super hot cheese, what else is there to nitpick about?
