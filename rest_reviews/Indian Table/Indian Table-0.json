The lamb was super tender and not game-y, but was a bit too salty (didn't stop us from polishing it off).\n- Saag paneer (5/5): This was a surprisingly vibrant shade of green which made me think they pureed fresh spinach and mixed it in with the finished dish. I'm used to seeing saag paneer that's more of a watery green/brown color, but this tasted really fresh, healthy, and almost fluffy. \n- Side of spicy okra (3/5): I was never a huge okra fan so I can't judge this fairly. My boyfriend loves okra and was pleased with this dish.\n- Rosemary naan (4/5): Naan is delicious, but the rosemary flavor in this wasn't as pronounced as I had hoped. I feel like kneading in pieces of rosemary into the dough would add more flavor.\n- Garlic naan (5/5): Garlic is king. Would be delicious to combine rosemary and naan together.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed having dinner here! Having two entrees, one side, and two naans (each order comes with four pieces) was perfect for two people and I would definitely come back for the saag paneer and garlic naan.", "author": "Sylvia L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-14", "description": "Homey neighborhood Indian place, on par with Curry Hill in Manhattan but miles from the best I've ever had.  Decor is cute (the muzak is ridiculously bad but kind of fun and soothing) and the staff are friendly. It almost feels like going to your friends' house and getting a home-cooked meal from their parents.\n\nThat said, the food is good but not great. The menu is unfocused with a lot of options, but most are standard Indian fare and not any different from any other decent Indian place in the city. The server recommended Rogan Josh, which featured a nicely braised goat shank in a cardamom-spiced tomato curry, which would have been lovely except that it was oversalted. Palak paneer was a pleasingly bright green with flavorful cheese chunks and was probably my favorite dish, and seemed to be pretty healthy as it was not overpowered with cream.  The okra side was also in a tomato-based curry and also nice, if you enjoy okra.  \n\nGarlic naan came out hot and soft with plenty of garlic; I also ordered the rosemary roti which was much less flavorful.  \n\nIt's the best choice for Indian food in this neck of the woods by a long shot and it's reasonably priced, so I'll likely be back for more.", "author": "Michael S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-31", "description": "I never write reviews but after eating here I felt compelled ! I had heard great things about Indian Table so we decided to give it a try .\nI am happy to report that it was an A-plus experience. I wanted an ice tea and although it was on the menu the owner made it for me specially and added fine fabulous Indian spices.\nWe ordered the Tandoori chicken and I have to say it was the juiciest most flavorful I had ever had.\nThe mushroom rice and rosemary naan were just so yummy. I have family coming in June and I can't wait to come here again.

It's situated in the very trendy area of Cobble Hill and can be a nightmare for parking if you're not lucky, but is worth the struggle. We had been wanting to try this place for a while and we were not disappointed!\n\nThe inside is cozy, not tiny, but not very large. The decor is nice, the space is clean, and the service is friendly. The whole inside smells of amazing spices, it's great. We ordered a bottle of wine, two starters, and four entrees. Everything was tasty! Very flavorful and filling. We left very satisfied and will definitely be back at some point. \n\nHead's up: the only alcohol they serve is wine...and it ain't cheap, folks.

Luckily enough we were right next to Indian Table so we wandered in - boy was that a good decision.\nAs other reviewers noted, the restaurant d\u00e9cor is not exactly a standout - I would say it's pretty spartan. The wait staff was good though, attentive and polite. The outstanding element was the food. We did some plate sharing so we had the Cauliflower Pea Subzi, Tandoori Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, a variety of Naan and one other plate that escapes my memory doh!) and all were really good - excellent flavors, not too spicy and enough food to keep us very satisfied. On top of that, the meal cost wasn't too bad, even with a couple of drinks.\n\nAll in all, it was a really nice meal - definitely on the list to head back to on a future return to Brooklyn!", "author": "Chris C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-28", "description": "Great neighborhood find.

Food was also on point. We had the garlic naan bread, a side of yellow daal, and a vegeterian dish of mixed vegetables that came with Jasmine rice- I can't remember the exact name of it. It turned out to be plenty of food for two girls (we even got a lunch out of the leftovers). They had a nice selection of wines- didn't see a cocktail menu. Service was a mixed bag; one server was very polite, but then forgot to bring the check when asked, others were all business (no pleasantries) but got the job done.", "author": "Aly M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-07", "description": "I had dinner here Saturday night, my first time eating at an Indian restaurant.

This is not your typical neighborhood Indian/Pakistani restaurant. The food is creative and well crafted and really works hard to make sure you have a good meal.\nI love this restaurant.

The interior is not very large, but is welcoming and cozy. \n\nFood: Large selection of entrees, decently priced drinks and friendly staff that's happy to make suggestions. Spicy calamari appetizer (waiter's suggestion), lamb curry, saffron rice and garlic naan with a bottle of red wine were all great and more than enough food for two people to share. \n\nService: Our waiter was very attentive and even told us about a way of getting a discount with our next order.

I think the place is very good but it's a neighborhood joint at best and by no means worth a trip, as the 4.5 might indicate.\n\nSpecifically, the food is only slightly above average (and the menu can be a chore to navigate as it is not always entirely up to date in terms of availability). It is competently made, fresh, tasty without being too heavy. In these respects, true, it is a notch above the many dime-a-dozen Indian takeout options in Brooklyn, and in this respect is worth the dine-in journey. Space could use some work to be more efficiently set up, service is ok, wine is very very reasonably priced which is a nice touch. \n\nOverall, a very solid Indian sit-down meal.", "author": "Joe S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-26", "description": "This place completely caught me off guard! At first my family and I thought that it would be average food because no one was sitting down for lunch except for us. I was impressed with the interior and how clean everything was. All of the tables looked squeaky clean which was a plus for me. Our server had personality, and explained what we didn't know on the menu which was helpful!

Perfect spot for date night. Soft/elegant jazz was playing the whole time with candles on the table and it seems that they have a good selection of wine. It was my first time - I did not come for a date but just randomly walked in with a group of friends. All the dishes we ordered were very good, with great service and welcomes from both the manager and the waitress. The lamb meat was especially fresh and tasty! Prices were very reasonable compared to the quality of food and service we were receiving. One of our friends did not order anything and the restaurant manager later came out to offer her a samosa appertizer dish on the house - he was super sweet. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely visit again, not only because it deserves 5 stars in every attribute but also because the manager obviously care about his business and the customers!
