I can say with some certainty that of them all, Moo Burger is... one of them.\n\nI had the Hangover burger - bison patty with bacon, cheddar and a fried egg. If there's one thing to know about me, it's that I can never resist egg on a burger.\n\nIt was a very solid burger, though not literally. Between the egg and the tomatoes, it barely held together. But no matter, burgers are meant to be eaten with the hands!\n\nFor sides, we went with fried mac and cheese balls, fried pickles, and zucchini fries. The fried pickles were actually spears instead of chips, which was an interesting change. I'm typically not a fan of frickles though. The mac and cheese balls were standard stuff. The zucchini fries were probably the best side. Everything came with different dipping sauces that I can't recall right now, but we also mixed and matched so I'm not sure what came with what.\n\nThey also have a good beer selection, which is always a plus.\n\nI had a good time.", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-15", "description": "Moo Burger\nNY Brooklyn Cobble Hill\n1pm Thursday 15th January 2015\nFour Stars\n\nWooden floors and walls with industrial steel celing and lighting. There's an open kitchen. They serve beer and wine. They serve water in a wine bottle. I had The Hangover Burger. It was well composed. The burger and all of the toppings fit exactly on the circumstance of the bun. The Bison was cooked medium which was close to the requested medium rare. The patty could have used a bit more salt. The Bacon was salty, crispy, and broken up to fit into the melty Swiss cheese. Shredded lettuce and thinly sliced tomato are signs of gourmet burger. The lettuce was a bit tired and the tomato was a bit mealy. The fried egg was nice and runny. \n\nThe zucchini fries were thickly battered, well seasoned, and fairly good. \n\nThe service was spot on. The price was reasonable.

One of the best I had in a long time. Great experience for lunch with Wonderful friendly service. For a place that has been here for 5 years it's nice to see the personal touch they still have! \n\nCan't wait to come back for dinner and try another one of these awesome burgers!", "author": "Brian F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-29", "description": "Incredible burgers!! If you are looking for a juicy, perfectly cooked burger, and you're in Brooklyn, this is the place to go. The 6 oz patties are all-natural, organic, and delicious. I had the All-American burger, which is the most \"basic\" choice, but is not basic at all! Piled high with the works (LTO) and served on a buttery, toasted bun, there is no way to go wrong with this choice. Add cheese to top it off the right way!\n\nThe onion rings are lightly breaded, making them crispier than your average o-ring! They are served with a southwestern spicy aioli and adds the perfect spice to it! The zucchini fries are also great, just a little salty. They are served with a yogurt sauce that helps tone down the saltiness l - a great pairing!\n\nI went with my father for lunch, and the place was packed with families and kids. Great spot to take the whole family for a causal bite. They also offer a kids menu. \n\nSo glad we tried this and hoping I make it back to BK to go again!", "author": "Stephanie P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-26", "description": "This place is great!

I went to Mooburger awhile ago and already am planning my next visit there. I went on a weeknight for dinner and the place was filled with people (that's a good sign). Even with the abundance of people, we were seated very quickly. I chose to have the greek burger with a side of zucchini fries while my friends all chose their own burger with a side of moo fries and fried mac and cheese.\n\nThe burgers were so good! It was cooked to perfection. The zucchini fries were also really good (kind of tasted like a fried pickle which I love!). The moo fries are regular french fries doused in meat, chili, and cheese which was very good as well. The fried mac and cheese was good but not great (I probably won't order it again).\n\nWould I come here again? Definitely. The service was attentive, the burgers came swiftly and was so delicious. I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Vivian Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-20", "description": "Delicious!!!! Great dinner with a great friend.

I decided to try this on a whim with a friend. She had the chicken sandwich while I decided to go straight for the burger. After a long wait to even place the order , we had an even longer wait for the service. I'll admit the restaurant was somewhat busy but it wasn't packed or unmanageable. When the food came it was just ok. The moo fries came with chili . That was pretty tasty . Another long wait to get the bill and we were out. There's a problem when the beer is the best part of the burger joint.
