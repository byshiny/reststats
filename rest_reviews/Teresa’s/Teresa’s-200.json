Basically you get a lot of good, home-cooked Americanized Eastern European food here. I think they're the only ones to serve food of its kind in this part of Brooklyn. (In Greenpoint, it'd be much cheaper, but more authentic and way grumpier service) but at least it's available if you are dying for pierogies or kielbasa in the Brooklyn Hts area. Their vegetable soup is fantastic - it has that homemade taste with fresh dill. The apple turnovers are great. I always order the kasha with gravy when I come for dinner.\n\nThe only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is b.c. I have experienced the crappy service from time to time (it's 2 scrawny boy waiters who are generally the guilty ones - just avoid them) I don't take that too seriously though; my perspective is one of Teresa's basically being a diner, and I've never been to a diner that didn't have it's share of staff with odd personalities (not to say all the staff is) so take it with a grain of salt. Try to focus on the decent food and un-diner-like ambiance of soft lightening, nice wood paneling, and many senior citizen regulars....If you take 1/2 your meal home, it's a bargain, and I guarantee you'll still be full.", "author": "Lauren S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-11", "description": "Thanks to the recommendation of a helpful mail carrier we wound up at Teresa's for lunch after a brisk walk across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan. We had a very tasty and comforting meal of stuffed cabbage, potato pancakes, pierogi's, cream of mushroom soup and shaved beets. We loved everything but if we had it to do over again we would skip the potato pancakes and save room for the blintzes that looked amazing. I have never liked stuffed cabbage but this one was a game changer for me. Mild yet so flavorful.

But when you sit down at the table and see the wine list on an a-frame menu with $5 Mondavi as the top of the line...it's a bad omen.\n\nWe ordered chicken \u0026 the vealmeatballs.  The veal balls were bland \u0026 the sauce was dill to the extreme - just not good.   Chicken was burnt.  The veggies that came with it also were just bad.  \n\nThe worst part of the experience was the BAD SERVICE.  \"Know what you want?\" was the greeting.  Waiter never checked to see if things were okay once we got our bad food.  We went 20+ minutes after we were done eating before we flagged someone else down to get the friggin check.  The waiter spent all his time chatting at the bar \u0026 was always grumpy when he spoke to us.  Miserable experience.  A waste of $40.  \nWhy is this getting 4 \u0026 5 stars from other yelpers?  \nMaybe I just went on a bad night?

Dinner specials from Monday to Thursday is a good value.  Home cooked style food.  My only complaint is the service.  It is consistently lousy.  The waiters and waitress usually hangs around the cash register chatting with each other.  You have to wave your hand for refills of water or coffee.  If you expect proactive service, you will not find it here.  There is a high turnover rate of help.  Seems like most are new immigrants and this is their first job.

We sat outside and the environment was great.  Tables were not that comfortable, bu the staff never rushed us, even as the outside seating seemed premium.\n\nThe menu as very eclectic, with a mix of traditional American selections such as turkey sandwiches and hamburgers combined with eastern European selections such as borscht and goulash.  Important to note that most of the dishes use heavy cream in the sauces, if you are trying to keep kosher.  We had a couple plates of the chicken marsala, which were HUGE and very tasty, if a bit oily.  For sides, we had salads (which were nothing but ordinary dinner side salads), and a mix of potatoes and pastas.  The sides were all unmemorable, with the exception of the beets.  They were amazing!  I could have eaten a gallon of them.  The cold borscht was so-so, and they steak was mediocre.  The waitress mistakenly told us that there was no cream in the stroganoff, only to later correct herself, and that the steak was pork when it was really beef.  Seemed to be a language thing more than anything, and her thick accent only added to the Polish atmosphere, so we didn't mind too much.\n\nBut, the real draw at Teresa's are the blintzes!\n\nWe ordered three blintzes, two with fresh blueberries, and they were incredible.  About 6-7 inches long and stuffed with cheese and berries.  Would have given Teresa's 3 stars, if not for the blintzes.\n\nIn all, we would probably go back and try more of their specialty dishes such as the stroganoff, goulash, and pirogi.  But, be sure to get the blintzes for dessert.", "author": "Jason H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-30", "description": "Delicious omellete!

The cabbage rolls are excellent, and nothing disastrous happened ... till I went for brunch ...\n\nThere should definitely have been more berries on the waffle, and we shouldn't have gotten a dirty look for asking for whipped cream.  Don't waffles always come with whipped cream?!?  And should they be bringing me my \"mayo on the side\" in that squeeze bottle from the kitchen?  wtf.
