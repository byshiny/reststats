I've heard such great things about this place that it was at the top of my list of places to eat. They use really good ingredients: fresh mozz cheese, really salty and brimey black olives, basil, good pepperoni - it all adds up to a great pie. Beware, cash only! And I would advise not using the ATM in the restaurant since it charges you a $4.50 service charge, WTF!! No line or wait on a Tuesday afternoon was a bonus too.

Life-changingly good.\n\nWe ate at Grimaldi's in the dead of winter (February) of this year and unlike all the reviews, we got right in and sat down. It's cash only, and we were ready. It was 3 pm and we weren't hungry but had heard so many good things we thought we'd at least have a slice. Pizza is available whole but not as a slice. We decided upon the classic margherita. It came out so piping hot my glasses steamed up. And then, we each took a bite.\n\n((((AMAZING.))))\n\nThere is no pizza like this to be found in Florida, or Jacksonville. Yum! Grimaldi's does New York pizza right. And for two people who weren't hungry, we ate every single slice (3 huge slices -- EACH!) and waddled out, fat and happy.", "author": "Caron S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "PIZZAAA! I love the olives they use for their pizza! It's salty as hell, but delicious! I honestly don't like leaving the city just because it's such a pain, but grimaldi's really isn't that far AND I would definitely make my way there again! Though I jst found out they have a location in manhattan as well, so I guess I won't need to? \n\nMy friend and I ordered a small regular pizza w/ sausage, olives and fresh garlic. OH boy, the fresh garlic made the pizza just THAT much better. Next time though, I'll have to add extra basil!\n\nI have to say this is one of my favorite pizza joints.

At all.\nNot only did we wait for an hour between 5 and 6pm to be seated, but we thought \"we'll call in a pie to go and get it in half the time\".\nBut guess what? They don't answer their damn phone.\nIt only becomes apparent once you've been allowed to enter that the restaurant is at about half capacity. \nLiterally, there are tons of tables unoccupied.  It's incredible.\nThey have this spiel about \"we refresh the ovens from 5-7pm\" which supposedly slows down the pizza output, but what kind of sense does it make to not seat people, thus making money on alcohol and other beverages while your parties are waiting for their food?\nThe owner wants passers-by to see \"the line\".  He wants to inflate the desirability of this place by leaving about 50 people out in the line at all times.\nWe were seated upstairs where we were under cold blue fluorescent lights and had freezing air conditioning on us the entire time.\nLooking below, the thick layer of dust on the photographs on the wall and above the bar was disturbing to see.\nThe loud James Brown blaring from the speakers was damn annoying.\nWhen we finally got our plain large pie after yet another hour of waiting, we actually enjoyed the first slice...\nThen things started to go downhill.  It became apparent that a good portion of the mozzarella was compromised - as in, it had that essence of mildew that mozzarella has when it's going bad.  I've experienced this at too many pizza joints in my lifetime, but to get it here was seriously pissing me off.\nHalf of the slices weren't cooked evenly so that the middle of the slice was almost raw dough.\nThe burnt basil browned \u0026 crisped in the middle of the pie sucked.\nThe best part of this whole experience? The Olde Brooklyn bottled root beer.\nMan was that delicious.  Seriously - it was the only enjoyable part of the meal.\nOur waiter didn't check on us once the entire time.\nAlso - the bathrooms are disgusting.  Toilet paper not even on the spool, but resting on the back of the toilet or in water on the floor, doors that don't lock, and paper towel rolls that are saturated with water from the sink because they can't bother to put them in the dispenser which undoubtedly doesn't work.  Pathetic.\nDo not - I repeat - do not waste your time or money here.", "author": "Beatrix K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-30", "description": "There's always a crazy long line whenever I come here. I'm pretty torn between Grimaldi's and Lombardi's.   Grimaldi's does some things better than Lombardi's, but the same goes the other way around.   I like that they use fresh ingredients and that they use ground sausage instead of sliced, but I like that Lombardi's chop their basil (it really makes a difference to me, rather than eating whole leaves) and the service better.  It also seems that there are more toppings offered at Grimaldi's which is nice because I think the sausage and mushroom tastes even better with garlic on in.\n\nI also love that it is located in DUMBO.  While in that area you can stroll over to Jacques Torres for dessert after and also enjoy the view.", "author": "Sandy J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-29", "description": "Oh Grimaldi's.... Where do I begin.... Well it was our first time in NYC, and we decided to do the clich\u00e9 touristy thing and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge to head to Grimaldi's for what everyone touted as the best pizza in NYC. Well coming from Chicago where pizza is king, Grimaldi's had a lot of standards to live up to, and sadly it just didn't.\n\nI didn't mind waiting in the line. In fact, we only waited 20 minutes. But what appalled me was the complete disregard for customer service. I suppose if you're so busy all the time, customer service doesn't matter but this was just ridiculous. After waiting our 20 minutes and being seated, we waited another 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge our existence. Then another 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order. After finishing our pizza, it took our server over 30 minutes to bring us the check--even after we asked. Apparently flirting with another table and watching the Yankees game was more important. \n\nFor a place this busy, I don't expect memorable service, but come on--30 minutes for a check? You would think they would be more efficient. And what's up with the crazy Jersey Shore club music blasting?\n\nOh the pizza...yah it's okay but definitely not worth the hassle.", "author": "Herminia I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-30", "description": "you can really taste the fresh cheese and ingredients on the pizza with every bite.

The line was still very long at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. When we finished and left, the group originally behind us was still in line waiting.\n\nso if you wanna try this place w/o waiting for hours, bring only 1 friend on a non-meal time :) I'll come again if I don't have to wait for hours.

We went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was 30 minute wait at around 3pm. We even heard people leave the restaurant and say \"over-rated\". Once we finally got in, the staff seemed pretty miserable.

I had very little time and a million things that I wanted to do.  Time was of the essence.  I decided Tri-State thin crust was a must to refresh my taco'd out Californian taste buds (New York, we can out-taco/burrito you with child-like ease *yawn*).  Since I made an explicit point to visit a friend in Brooklyn, I will kindly bow out of the Lombardi/Di Fara war.  Thus, I hopped on the train from West 4th and hopped off at High Street (subway genius, I have no clue if that monstrosity in L.A. works since I live in my car) to be greeted by friend.  Smooth-as-silk lovely.\n\nNow, I have contributed many ridiculous hours of my life to the Grimaldi line when I lived here for work and internships.  Thus, I was shocked--gobsmacked, to be precise.  When we approached the joint, instead of finding a line about 50 people deep, there were only FOUR people.  WTH, I turned and gave my friend a concerned, asking look, \"Has the place gone to bloody hell?\"  She was just as confused as I.\n\nThrilled as I was, I could not help but be, well, a little curious.  Okay, worried.  Bottom line: I was not about to waste my precious red-eye time on a snore-a-licious pizza, thus I conducted some quick reconnaisance on my way to wash my hands.  The enormous brick coal-fired oven was still there.  I could see the angry hot coals on the sidelines.  That oven's intense heat is the key to Grimaldi's consistency and I was relieved to see it piping hot and still popping.\n\nShame on me for doubting.  Our pizza was outstanding!  Just as great as I remember it to be, the pie is standard-bearer thin with a crust that boasts that perfect balance of charred chewy and satisfyingly crunchy.  Toppings are so flavorful--from the buffalo mozzarella to that sausage!  The sausage they use at Grimaldi's is superb--quality Italian sausage of moist, firm consistency, robust of flavor from aromatic fennel.  They drizzle the whole pie with a tomato sauce so tangy good you will be pondering it as you devour like a wolf.\n\nInterior is what I would call confident and sure:  \"We don't care, we have a good thing going here.\"  Nonetheless, as a fan of Ol' Blue Eyes, I can't say it bothers me one bit.  That said, I wanted to eat outside like I used to.  It's the way to go.  With a view of the stunning Brooklyn Bridge and peerless Manhatten skyline, gorging on excellent pizza with a childhood friend, I cannot think of a better way to become a blissfully peaceful balloon.", "author": "Dee C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-15", "description": "Grimaldi's pizza is okay but given the reputation and the fact that people stand on line to go there I was expecting it to be a lot better.", "author": "Rich M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-30", "description": "My favorite pizza place in the country.

Got there about 5:45pm and it wasn't too bad.\n\nPizza is amazing. People who say it's top 10 or whatnot in New York aren't kidding. Crust is cooked perfectly in their coal fired oven, the sauce is a delicious compliment, and the cheese... is clearly more than a cut above average. We had a large pepperoni and two beers, and the pepperoni had just the right amount of spice and chewiness.\n\nBiggest issues are the lines and that our antipasti never arrived. They noticed this and took it off the bill (and even asked if we wanted it when the pizza came-- we had pizza already, we don't want the appetizer dammit!).\n\nBeing from a state that doesn't have any good pizza at all means my taste buds spent ample time at other NY pizza places on every trip I make to NYC, and Grimaldi's is by far the best I've had.
