Pizza slices are not small and not too big and have the perfect crispy baked crust. Always taste fresh and and home made. Workers/ staff and incredibly nice and the pizzeria itself is a very cozy, New York City like pizzeria! It's located across Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, and The Brooklyn Hospital Center!", "author": "Agnes G."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": null, "name": "Pipitone\u2019s Pizza", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "100 Dekalb Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": null, "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17138584376"}
