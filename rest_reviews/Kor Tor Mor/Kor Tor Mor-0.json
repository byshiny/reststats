There are plenty of them around but this one tops with its combination of delicious food, great service and lovely ambience. Been here 2 times now, once for the lunch special and once for dinner. Left extremely satisfied both times. Its been themed as a Bangkok style eatery and the walls are adorned with lovely black and white prints of the Thai capital. I love that they've taken the effort to create a different ambience from the general cookie cutter variety you see in most Thai places. \n\nMy go to at any Thai place is the Massaman curry and Kor Tor Mor delivered a winner on that front when I had it for the lunch special. Came with thai salad and spring rolls and was a steal at under $10. Returned for dinner based on the positive lunch experience and was not disappointed. Had the Rad Prik Tofu which was spicy and flavorful, not just blinded doused with hot sauce. The corn fritter appetizer was fantastic as was the roti canai. Service was friendly and quick. Will definitely be back to try more things from the menu.", "author": "Varun D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-02", "description": "It's Saturday night, and I needed a meal to pair with all the wine I'm about to drink. My first instinct was to order from my usual Thai place, but then I remembered how unsatisfied I'd been from previous orders. \n\nI then hangrily scrolled through yelp and it led me here. I ended up placing a delivery order for: pad see yuu, coconut sticky rice, steamed broccoli and spring rolls. The only upset is the fact that I had been ordering Thai from elsewhere this entire time! I mean everything was so delicious and reasonable priced. They payed attention to my note about the pad see yuu and made it spicy, and they even give you several spring rolls for $6 (not just 2 like I had expected) so it was a pleasant surprise. My food came quick, and the delivery man was very nice. \n\nI'll for sure order from here again. \n\nNow to get to this wine that I poured but didn't touch because I was too busy in awe of the food.", "author": "Shakira W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-04", "description": "Update for 2019. Based on some recent reviews, it seems like things have been going downhill - and based on my own experiences with takeout, I'm taking a star off.\n\nUpdates:\nHave been ordering lots of takeout from them over the past year, and I would estimate that around 50% of the time something was wrong with the order. Whether it was little things like dumplings or spring rolls missing their sauce, or bigger issues like an entire dish being something else. Haven't called to complain yet and stupidly just accepted whatever was delivered due to hunger, frustration, or feeling bad for the delivery guys having to make the rainy ride back to correct it when it wasn't their fault... but it should be brought up. This has been an ongoing issue with their takeout, so be prepared: It's not me - it's you.\n\nOriginal review:\nI can't remember what was here before, but I wasn't expecting this to be another memorable restaurant as everything on this portion of Smith Street seems to come and go on a monthly basis. Hopefully Kor Tor Mor remains.\n\nWhat struck me as strange, is that there are roughly 4 other Thai places within a few blocks distance, so much like a Starbucks across from another Starbucks, I'm not at the edge of the Universe as Louis Black would have me believe, but I'm in fact inside one of the best Thai places in the neighborhood.\n\nEverything I've tried has been great, good portions, decent prices, and friendly/fast service. Though there was one summer day where the AC wasn't working and that kept me from staying.\n\nIf you're looking for good Thai food, check this place out, you'll enjoy it. I know I will, for as long as they're around.", "author": "Ian J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-10", "description": "You know when you go to put on your jacket and you stick your hand in your pocket and pull out a $20 that you forgot about?  That's how I felt when I realized that Kor Tor Mor was on my bookmarked list forever and I finally got to try it out for dinner!  Yay me!\n\nSince it was a Thursday night, I was seated right away at a table closed to the door for a table for one.  Eating alone means more for me, so I'm cool with that.  The atmosphere was actually pretty nice for a date for a girls night out, so I would totally recommend it, especially that they decorated for the holidays - another plus.  \n\nOrdering, I got my staples for better judgement - a Thai iced tea, a Tom Kha soup, and a Drunken Noodles, medium spice with beef.  Normally my drunken noodles come with shrimp, but the craving for beef took over me.  \n\nMy Tom Kha soup for $6 for a cup, I wasn't expecting as much chicken as I got in that portion!  This was so creamy, so packed with veggies and thick strips of chicken, that I would've been just as equally happy if I opted for the bowl!  The sliced of lemongrass inside with a galanga leaf proved to me that this wasn't your unwhelming cup of this basic soup.  This alone set the expectation bar fairly high for my main course; it was perfect on that cold night!\n\nMy Drunken Noodles with beef had me drunk in LOVE!  The medium spice was absolutely perfect for me, and gave me the heat I wanted without me suffering with the spice.  The slices of beef were just as impressive as the slices of chicken in my soup - generous and plentiful.  My noodles were springy and evenly covered in its savory sauce.  I was sad when my plate was cleaned, but I will need to do this again soon!", "author": "Jaclyn C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-12-08", "description": "Came in on Saturday night, only Thai place without a long wait. However you find out shortly why...they prioritize Take Out over Dine In.\n\nService:\nWe were seated at 7:40 and it took 1 hour from the moment we ordered to get only the appetizers. Also the main courses for our table of 6 came out 2 at a time and the last 2 dishes didn't come until everyone was almost done eating. All while the take out orders were flying out the door. On top of all that, our waiter never stopped by to say how's the food or perhaps tell us why the food was taking longer then usual. \n\nFood:\n\nFlavor of the lamb salad, papaya salad, fried calamari, pad Thai, drunken noodle, green curry and fried fish were all pretty good. Nice portion size and strong flavors.\n\n\nI wouldn't recommend dining in, better to order out.

I went with the lunch special since its affordable and had options of appetizers. The spring rolls were perfectly fried and the sauce was good. I then had the shrimps in ginger sauce! Sooo good. And even though is a lunch special there was many shrimps on this dish. Not like some places I know th will only add 3 shrimps or so.

They told me there was no wait and when my party of 6 got there, they had a table reserved for us. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty empty when we went with maybe two other parties dining. We were seated, and the menu was already out waiting for us. We ordered our appetizers and the entrees. It did not come out for at least an hour. Meanwhile, the staff were busy doing take out orders rather than serving those who are at the restaurant. \n\nI ordered a tofu pad Thai but I did not get to try it. The entrees came out late and even when it did come out, it came out one by one. My pad Thai took over an hour to get and make, that I didn't want it anymore. The rest of the table had already gotten their dish and were close to finishing it. I told them to cancel my pad Thai. When the server brought the pad Thai over (after I asked where it was, and how long it'll take for me to get it and when he told me it's not ready yet I told him to cancel it), I told him I didn't want it anymore. He said \"ok sure\" and took the dish back. No form of apology whatsoever. \n\nOur water was not filled but luckily, we ordered a Thai iced tea so good thing, we had something to drink. \n\nThe food here is flavorful, but I wouldn't go back again. Maybe if you live around the area and can do take out, sure. But I did see delivery services (I.e. doordash) waiting for the meals for at least 20-30mins... so who knows?

Most of the ones I've tried in Manhattan have been underwhelming, and the only curry they can offer vegan is Massaman (not my favorite). Give me red, green or panang curry over that any day.\n\nNot only does Kor Tor Mor have a whole vegan menu they can also adjust most, if not all, of their curries to be vegan. And what's more...they're fantastic.\n\nI've been here twice now and I'll definitely be back. I live in Washington Heights but it is worth the subway ride if I have a craving. My favorite so far is the red curry. I get veggies but add tofu (it doesn't come with it automatically). The veggie spring rolls and dumplings are also good. I would like to try the green curry next time.\n\nThe restaurant is on the smaller side but has plenty of tables and a nice ambiance. The staff are friendly, the food comes out efficiently and the restrooms are clean. Thank you Kor Tor Mor - I wish I had discovered you sooner.

They have a pretty extensive menu with man vegan options. Prices for both their food and drinks are very reasonable. \n\nWe started off with their fried chive dumplings, chicken wings, and spring rolls. It was all pretty good. Wasn't sure what to expect from their chive dumplings, it was super crispy and all chives and what seemed to be starch holding it together, my friends and I really enjoyed this, it came with a soy vinaigrette on the side which was good. Chicken wings were super crispy, think buffalo wings without the sauce. \n\nI ordered their kor tor clay pot rice, this is a Chinese dish that even had Chinese sausage but I guess their take on it... it came out not in a clay pot which the waiter explained why they took it out or something and apologized for it.. couldn't hear him well but I didn't really care for it anyways. The rice was super flavorful! All my friends loved my dish, everyone else enjoyed their fried rice and pad Thai as well. \n\nI will definitely keep this place in mind whenever someone mentions they want Thai food.", "author": "Lolin L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-05", "description": "If you're in the mood for some spicy Thai food this is the place to be! The appetizers are great. The drinks are refreshing and the basils are HOT! I had a chicken basil that was out of this world. The sauce was delicious with just enough heat to leave you wanting more. Add some spring rolls and corn fritters and you've found the perfect meal. I even tried the Thai coconut pudding, it was a delicious way to end the perfect meal. Also, I insist you try a Thai ice tea float! You won't regret it. The service is attentive and quick, the ambience is perfect for a date night, a girls night out, or even family dinner. They can totally accommodate a small dinner party.

The food was pretty good.\nToday, I substituted the veggie duck for tofu, as I have many times, and was upcharged not the usual $1 (as has happened many times), but $5. I called and flagged what appeared to be an error. I was told it was not an error, and that what has cost (and costs at any other Thai restaurant) $1, always cost $5. It isn't true - I have many receipts to prove it. Wha tthis means is that they can and will charge you whatever they want, whenever they want, and tell you it has always been that way. This demonstrates a very basic lack of respect for customers. Is it better to charge $5 for something that shouldn't cost $1 so that people never go to your restaurant again?

The coconut broth was meh. I've never tried vegan shrimp. I took a bite of one and thought I was transported to one of the cantos in Dante's Purgatory. Truly hell-ish. I pulled them out (I think there were five) and just spooned up the sad room temperature broth. \n\nThe fried corn appetizer was interesting \u0026  served very warm (yay, warm!)\n\nOur bill came with two additional items on it that we never ordered \u0026 never got. When I asked what these items were I was informed they were two items for another table, and the waitress pointed to the table that had ordered those two items.

Order take out and your food will arrive much faster... \n\nHad a very unpleasant experience here at Kor Tor Mor. The service was very slow and customer service just appalling. We waited over an hour for our food and even worst when the food finally started coming out it was lukewarm...\n\nThe restaurant seems to prioritize their takeout service and really cares little for the patrons whom dine in. And it's a shame, they have a nice decor and large tables/benches that line the whole place yet they care too little to take care of those who are dining in. And it was not jsut our table. I can see other tables were suffering from slow service as well. As the take out dishes continue to be pushed out the kitchen all those who were dining in were still waiting for food. On top of that our waiter was not empathetic to the situation and honestly could careless that our food was very late and very cold. \n\nThis was by far one of the worst dining experiences I've had and I would not return here.

I walk past it all the time and finally decided to check it out in the middle of a snowstorm. Solid life decisions.\n\nI tried the papaya salad, tom yum soup and basil fried rice. There wasn't anything extraordinary about the basil fried rice per say but it definitely hit the sweet spot. This is what I consider to be comfort food, (opposed to mac n cheese, etc).\n\nThe papaya salad was very fresh, sour, with definite notes of fish sauce. Adorned generously with peanuts, so allergies beware!\n\nThe tom yum soup broth was hearty and flavorful. Maybe not as suitable for those with a light palate.
