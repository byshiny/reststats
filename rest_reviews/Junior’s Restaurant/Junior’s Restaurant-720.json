Family Saturday breakfast for five. Basic diner fare. Had not been here in years. High point -- our waitress was wonderful.\n\nI love pastries but these were not good. I didn't try the rolls though.\n\nTwo had the corned beef hash; it's the waitress's husband's favorite and is made fresh. They both loved it but couldn't finish - large portions.\n\nMy omelet was overcooked; that's why I'm giving a 2. The hash browns were fine.\n\nShared some pancakes, which again were OK but not great.

Gotta say it was better than what I expected. Took a special someone here for their birthday last week cause that's where they wanted to go and was taken kind of by shocked, cause I really don't know of anyone who wants to go to Junior's for their birthday but whatever. I really had no memory of what the food tasted like and just know that Junior's' was known for its cheesecake.  To my surprise the food was better than what I expected...\n\nI had the jumbo stuffed shrimp with crab meat, yellow rice and veggies. Wasn't the greatest meal in the world but wasn't disappointed by it either, especially being that I didn't even know that Juniors served seafood like that. The person I took had Southern Fried Chicken along with a potato if I remember correctly and some cornbread. I tried her chicken and it was good as well...For dessert, she of course had the cheesecake while I ordered a chocolate mousse cake. I didn't try her cheesecake cause she took it home but I am pretty sure it was good but the chocolate mousse cake was on point! Also had their version of a Blue Hawaiin which was just ehh...definitely not the taste of other well known Blue Hawaiin's but nobody's perfect. The service was excellent though, I must say and it was a nice ambiance.\n\nNot in a rush to come back here but I still would...", "author": "Jay L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-01", "description": "Approaching cheesecake corner. You know what that means. You're entering a red and yellow diner that isn't known for their food. People shouldn't come here for dinner. Perhaps drunk food but its not really worth a sober visit for sustenance.\n\nThis is a place for diabetes forming habits. For people to feel like munchkins eating giant sized baked goods because damn they don't have their portions under control.\n\njust don't think about how many calories you're scarfing down there in one slice. That 6-8 dollar slice is like taking a huge tub of cream and sugar and making it taste like something real (red velvet for instance) and cramming it into a thick juicy moist slice of cheesy cakey goodness.\n\nred velvet layer cake by itself is the bomb. the bright red juniors color combined with cream cheesy frosting makes it almost seem like you don't need to try the red velvet cheesecake. oh but you do.\n\nthe fruit topped cheesecakes are key. the devils food isn't as awesome (not really a fan) but it is a chocolately explosion of thick chocolate frosting with thick not too sweet cheesecake.\n\nseriously. dessert, people. that's why juniors has it's own street corner renamed. forget that jewish guys name above the sign for \"cheesecake corner\".\n\ni'd recommend sharing your slices or you'll be having some sugar diabetes soon!", "author": "Mary P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "I haven't been here for years, \u0026 it's absolutely as fabulous as I remembered it.

Do you know what the most awesome experience was? Seeing the picture of Spike Lee staring at me when I turned around to flush the toilet in the restroom. \n\nI'm one of the trite members of the City that say the cheesecake has slipped. But honestly, it has. That said, I did try something different than the regular cheese cake offerings this time. I mixed it up by ordering the Black Forest Cheesecake.  I actually liked it quite a bit. Very rummy with cherries on the inside as opposed to how I imaged it would be, on top. That and the pickles in the relish tray that comes out, are the only things I can recommend. \n\nWhy only two stars, though? Service. Couldn't understand my server and then he disappeared. Good work, dude. My friend's chicken fingers weren't appetizing and ended up being returned. But that wasn't a complete shock. The woman who skipped the line in the restroom to throw-up, didn't recommend anyone eat the chicken anyway. Yipes. And listening to the tourists complain about the upstairs location of the restroom and the size of it, made me want to shoot myself in the head. Each one complained as they got on line.\n\nAs you can see, the restroom was the most memorable part of this dining experience. \nI now know what Tourist Hell is.", "author": "Karen S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-25", "description": "I have to give Junior's credit for improving the overall quality of their food. When I went a year ago (and took my in-laws), the desserts were phenomenal (strawberry shortcake the size of your head? yes, please!) but the rest of the menu was sub-par. I went again more recently and was pleasantly surprised. \n\nIt's worth noting that I tend to venture there on the early-side on the weekends, since I generally skip lunch. \n\nGet the matzoh ball soup, you will not regret it.
