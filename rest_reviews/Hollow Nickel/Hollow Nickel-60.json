It was late Thursday night and it was perfectly quiet! The entrance was narrow with white twinkle lights and candles placed throughout the bar.  The dim lighting allowed for a romantic ambiance which I loved!  \n\nWe were greeted almost immediately upon finding a nice table in the back.  I continued to marvel at how cozy this place was with their book shelves filled with books (shocking I know, but in a bar??) and a fireplace lit up with candles of different heights.  The wall above it seemed to be chalkboard but the walls in the bathroom were definitely chalkboard! Fun!\n\nMy girlfriends and I just wanted a nightcap and ordered a couple drinks.  I ordered a Shirley Temple, because I'm responsible and had important work to do the next morning, while my girlfriends had beer, because they didn't have urgent work due in the morning. We all decided to share seasoned fries with melted cheese and I'm pretty sure we were disappointed with how it turned out.  I thought it hit the spot but my friend brought up a good point that the cheese should have been flavored and that in lieu of gravy, we should not have been charged for chipotle mayo sauce...Oh and the seasoning on the fries was just dill. Plain ol' dill.\n\nOur server was very attentive if not overly attentive.  He was very patient with us and tried his best to accommodate our requests.  Pretty solid service and experience overall despite the gravy/chipotle mayo and tasteless fries incident.  The location is great since it's very close to the Atlantic Ave station by the way.  Despite that, willing to try other food they may offer and will definitely visit this place again.", "author": "Anna F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "description": "I came here more than a week ago to celebrate my best friend's birthday and this place gave me the most unexpected experience ever. Coming here, I thought it was going to be like a typical restaurant, with a waiter/waitress taking you to your seat and coming to your table every 20 minutes refilling water and asking if your food was good. Instead, this place ended up being the most relaxing and freeing place to dine and drink.\n\nWhen we went into the restaurant, the bartender simply told us to sit anywhere and handed us the menu. We had to go up to the bar, just to order our food and drinks, which was I found surprising.\n\nWe ordered nachos, burgers and french toast which all fell in the range of $11-20. The portion of the burger was pretty big with a side of fries. The nachos were one of the best nachos I have ever had, as it came with a container of guacamole, and salsa, which all had a hint of spice to it which gave it a kick of flavor. I particularly loved the french toast I ordered, as it was topped with berries and a side of maple syrup. The french toast was very rich in flavor and had the perfect texture, not too mushy in the middle and not burnt on the outside.\n\nIf you are someone who is particularly into fruity drinks, I'd recommend getting the white peach sangria; it has a small kick of alcohol that kind of hit me a bit, but with an overall fruity taste. \n\nFood: delicious, portion is worth the money\nAtmosphere: very relaxed, color scheme of black and red (which I love)\nService: majority of the time self-service, I had to repeat a few times my order of french toast since he did not hear me.\n\nIf you are in the area of Barclay Center after watching a game or concert, I would recommend this place as it is spacious and not as crowded as other places in Brooklyn. One more perk, is that there is a beautiful outdoor setting to hang out or go for on a casual date.", "author": "Ladiny P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-23", "description": "A good local bar with a solid burger and beer combo.

I threw a party here for about 50-60 people on a Saturday night. We set up an open bar and used both the inside and outside parts of the restaurant. The management and staff could not have been more helpful throughout the whole party, including helping me set up. The atmosphere at the bar was perfect and I got rave reviews from my guests the next day. \nMy only \"problem\" was dealing with effects of the free bottle of rum they gave me the morning after. \nThanks again to everyone at the Hollow NIckel.

I've been able to have work meetings here, dates, and heart-to-heart talks with good friends - the nice neighborhood atmosphere accommodates it all. \nThe food is fresh, and made of good ingredients, which can't be said for a lot of NY restaurants these days - focused as restauranteers are these days on volume of customers rather than quality of food. These guys prepare your food as if they prepared it for you, well beyond the usual bar food standard. A warning to vegetarians like myself - there's some meat in things where you wouldn't expect it- like the jalapeno poppers. Ask clarifying questions.\nLast time I was there they suffered a few minor kinks and gave me a free margarita to compensate, which made me feel that they really cared about keeping customers happy and well respected.", "author": "r m."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-01", "description": "Nice little spot on atlantic avenue to get together with friends.

Decent drink prices and awesome bar food. The fried pickles are killer and the chicken tenders are everything you want a chicken tender to be. Space is limited so get there well before 10 if you want somewhere to sit.\n\nThe staff is really friendly and helpful. We had a great chat with one of the bartenders when we were there and he even made us some delicious custom drinks that he made up on the spot. Small beer and wine list, but always a varied offering. For liquor, they definitely focus on whiskey though, so maybe pass this one if that's not your spirit of choice.\n\nSince I don't live in Brooklyn, the location is a bit out of the way for me.
