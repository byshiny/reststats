Breaded chicken cutlet was burnt, while the sandwich was suppose to have honey mustard and asiago cheese- I did not get any. Just lettuce and a tomato with chicken between a brioche bun.

(though their cookies have recently gone down hill)\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes the manager is a real d*ck to the people who work there and there's a pretty obvious high turnover of waitstaff (most likely because of it).  I've seen him belittle delivery guys, I witnessed him actually purposefully spilling a guy's water all over the floor (maybe it was a joke, but the waiter didn't find it funny at all), I even witnessed him telling a delivery guy specifically to include chocolate milk with the order and then when the guy came back, he was told the customer wanted regular milk instead and that it was HIS fault (meaning the delivery guy's).  \n\nThe manager is always nice to me, so there's no problem there, but it just seems like he takes a lot of his frustrations out on the people that work there by being really mean to them.

The mac and cheese is vile. I'm not sure what is in it but its not cheese, the breadcrumb crust was also gross. The quesadilla was very good and a large portion size. The omelet was okay but nothing the write home about- same with the fries. The fries tasted like fries that you buy in the frozen section of the grocery store and put in the oven at home.

And I just want to shout out to the bar staff for still being very friendly and keeping it together because we were definitely a rowdy crowd. I spilled my drink all over myself and not only did they clean it up quickly, but they also replaced my drink for free. I didn't get to try the food and it didn't look super appetizing, but my friends all seemed to enjoy it (esp. the 50\u00a2 wings!). My only complaint was the douchey karaoke guy who was \"curating\" a \"flow\" for the music. He pretty much kept skipping people in our group so him and his friends could sing lame ass songs, even though we were the only reason the bar was so packed. The sun was still up when I put in my song request and it wasn't until 11:30pm until I got to sing (when all his friends left). In the same time period, three different women had been allowed to go up two or three times. I won the raffle for a free drink though and it was overall a really fun night!

But it's not that good in the sense that they overcook the chicken tenders, the beans have been sitting around, and it doesn't feel really fresh.  This is the type of place where you kind of know what you should and should not order, and what is and what is not fresh.  Don't expect that your food is going to taste different or better than you expect, but it'll taste like you imagine it will taste.  So why do I rate it 5 stars then you ask, right?!?  Well, let me tell you.\n\n1) the people that go here are regulars.  So most order the same thing because they figured out what they like and what is good there.  And once you figure that out, then you're golden.  It might take some trial and error for you newbies though, but it's worth it.\n2) the place has character.  Don't let that recent renovation (don't laugh, yes the place was fairly recently renovated) fool you!  This place has been around and been in the neighborhood.  The owners are around, you see them, you know them, and they remember you.  \n3) the offer free (usually up to 1) refill on sodas.  Worth mentioning and giving them a shout-out for, since this is way too rare in NYC.  \n4) and this is a big one - you can take your kids here.  Or your grandparents.  And both can complain and make noise and it's ok.  Just try and get a booth and reign your kids in every once in a while so people know that you're trying.  Or let the kids stare at the cookies behind the glass window.  The place is definitely kid-friendly and people won't look down on you here.  It's the kind of place where people who are eating around you might even comment on how cute your kids are, or at least smile at them and pick up some of their toys when they throw them on the ground.  But then again it IS Brooklyn so you also might get someone who give you dirty looks.  But since it IS Brooklyn you can give them the stink eye right back, knowing that you're in a kid-friendly place and if they want to eat at a fancy restaurant without people, kids, noise, mess, etc. they can walk outside to just about every other sit down restaurant in NYC and feel right at home.  This is your one restaurant damn it, own it and don't apologize! \n5) late night hours.  In my younger days (or at least my days before having kids) I was known for coming here late late night and eating those disco fries.  Ah, the days.  \n6) breakfast is particularly good/can't go wrong.\n7) The prices are fairly reasonable, given the portion size, and the fact that you can kind of hang out a little.  The place is pretty big which means that they generally aren't chasing you out to give your table to someone else.  This is a luxury in NYC, which is sometimes forgotten.  But I got you Park diner, I notice it.\n8) to sum it up since I'm being so succinct here (ha), I give it 5 stars because I worry about the day that their landlord raises the rent and they pack it up.  It's one of those restaurants that there aren't enough of in NYC and that keep shutting down. I would be seriously sad if that happens because you KNOW that whatever restaurant took its place (although it's just as likely to be replaced by high-rise apartments) it wouldn't be half as good as Park diner.  And it certainly wouldn't be a place that you could easily come to and bring your family and extended family to, knowing that whether you're a party of 1 who sits at the counter, or a drop-in party of 10 without reservations, you'll be welcomed with a smile.  Or semi-smile, which really is just as good.  \n\nListen, the truth is that the wait staff are some good, some not so good.  And some of the good ones aren't good on every visit, and some of the bad ones are good on some visits.  So it's hit or miss.  If you're in a rush, then do things to help the meal along like being ready to order, telling the waitstaff you're in a rush, asking for your check, etc.  If you also want to make sure that you get what you're ordering from the menu, you should double confirm what is in the meal or what comes with the meal.  Some things on the menu are a little different when served (e.g. the fish tacos come with things that the menu doesn't mention, and didn't come with other things that they said it did, certain salads add things that aren't in the description). They added a sports bar area in case you want to watch games.  Also, good event space if you ever want something like that too.", "author": "Jessica H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-24", "description": "I like this place, so I'll start with the reasons why it didn't get a 5th star. Service is sometimes slow, prices are a little high, and none of the food is actually phenomenal. This is a basic diner with a big menu and drip coffee. \n\nPark Plaza is still a great staple in the area because of its late hours and classic diner food. Expect a typical breakfast combo (juice, coffee, eggs, bacon/sausage, toast, French toast/pancake) to run you 25-30% higher than at the typical cash diner you'd find upstate or in NJ or PA. That's probably because of the location. Last year's renovation made the place much cleaner and modern, but took away some of the old Brooklyn/outdated diner feel.\n\nIf you need a reliable place for corned beef and hash or a Monte Cristo but can't get into Bensonhurst or out onto the Isand, look no further. \n\nTip: you'll normally get refills on the iced coffee just like the regular coffee, so it's great for those who drink it black and forego the syrups at Starbucks anyway.", "author": "Courtney F."}], "servesCuisine": "American (New)", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Park Plaza Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "220 Cadman Plz W", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0zjK4v3ipM49Qj9I1DlfNw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185965900"}
