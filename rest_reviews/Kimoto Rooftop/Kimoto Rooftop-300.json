Kimoto is a clean, and chic place to be at if you're looking for a well prepared meal, or a fine cock-tail. I was surprised at the level of service the staff had, and well experienced bartenders (I was surprised that the bartenders knew how to make a good Sazerac.

My bf and I just moved to the area and are looking for a place with killer cocktails that is within a 5 minute walk from home (WINTER IS COMING). Great ambience, views, Friday night jams, and food. \n\nCocktails: I had their No Sleep Til, Enlightenment, and Tranquility (ascending order) all of which were high quality and delicious. What are the odds that the 3 first drinks I tried at this bar were all excellent from the get-go? My boyfriend ordered a few whiskey cocktails. I'm not a whiskey person at all, but even I enjoyed a sip of those crafts. A+ drinks for sure. Their beer list is extensive, although I would suggest they start carrying Kirin and Asahi, the two key beers I drank all over Japan a couple years back. \n\nFood: we had the wings, disco fries, and takoyaki (ascending order) which were all surprisingly good. \n\nAmbience: on a Friday night, they played old school hip hop and r\u0026b jams which had me groovin all night. Everyone was really welcoming and nice. The place was not crowded, probably 30 customers max at one point. This is probably because they just opened a month ago. \n\nAll in all, we found our new go-to spot for close-to-home cocktails. Yes, this place is slightly on the expensive side, but you're in NY where everything has a mark-up and if you can't accept that you probably shouldn't live here. :) Enjoy!", "author": "R J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-09", "description": "I was excited about this place opening since my boyfriend just got a job in Brooklyn and we've been looking for some bars close to his work to hit up after a long day.\n\nKimoto is through a hotel lobby and I suggest you call for reservations if you want a table and not to sit at the bar. It was completely empty, but they wouldn't seat anyone with a res. in the outdoor/patio area. Seemed a little self-important and silly, but whatever because we called.\n\nThe dress code didn't seem very strict, but it might have been because it was a Thursday night.\n\nWe had two drinks, the No Sleep Till and the Humidor (which is a $19 drink) and they were really nice, albeit expensive.  Well balanced and strong enough to taste the actual alcohol in them which is something I really miss in a lot of bars in NYC. \n\nWe also had the spam hot dogs, disco fries, and takoyaki. All of the food blew me away.  It was so good and I didn't want it to be because it was so expensive.  For two drinks and three snacks it was well over $100 after tip.  \n\nSo maybe I'll go back sometime when there's cash burning a hole in my pocket, or I have some friends in town and want to go to a only mildly pretentious rooftop bar, but there's so many new places to explore and I feel fairly certain that I can re-create the spam dogs and cocktails at home.", "author": "Kristyn K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-26", "description": "Service was excellent but their food was either too salty or too bland. This is a place I would go if I was staying in the hotel below them to grab a quick drink.

The interior was decent-but it was way too dark that we couldn't even read the menu. Foods were nothing special, especially the chicken wings that we ordered. It was under flavored and not to mention, there was a long black hair in it. It was unacceptable. We were disappointed as we were expecting more from the 5 star executive chef, Brian but the food at Kimoto were below average. Although they sell this place as a \"beer garden\", this place only have Asian beers. It's not a place that you can get a glass of nice craft beer or a bottle of Heineken.\n\nThe bartender and servers took forever to take our orders and they were chatting up with other people while they were getting our drinks and food. Drinks weren't anything special. Disappointed and will not be returning.", "author": "Mizuka M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-09-27", "description": "I was looking forward to checking out this place and I went there with my Japanese friend.\nThe elevator guy basically told me that I can't wear flip flops, and asked if I lived far from there,  hoping I would go change? Wth? I was wearing super nice Birkenstocks by the way. He eventually said I was OK to go in. \nFood was fine,  no healthy options at all. I was excited about the beer selection but it was pretty weak.  Even one of the sushi places in Ft.  Greene has a better Japanese craft beer selection. And yeah,  some beers are like $16 unless you want to drink shity beer.", "author": "Karolina T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-20", "description": "Went on a Saturday night around 8. Atmosphere is definitely club-y--music a notch too loud for a dinner conversation and lighting a notch too low to see the menu. \n\nFood is decent--we had the salmon crudo, disco fries and the potato croquttes (which were overpowered by the overly sweet ketchup to be honest). It's pub fare for sure--if you're interested in really great Japanese small plates at a similar price point, I recommend Ganso Yaki nearby. \n\nService is excellent. The view is good, though not of Manhattan.\n\nWe will be be back to see how it evolves. Definitely a place to party!", "author": "Christina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-03", "description": "On merits of being a bar alone, this place is worth a visit - the drinks are stellar across the board, one smoky whisky drink with dried ginger in particular is without a doubt my favorite mixed drink I've tried in a while.\n\n The food is where this place really shines however. Chef Brian Tsao is some kind of insane genius in the kitchen, because what he's churning out in that place is all at once the total opposite of normal bar food, and exactly what it should have been all along. A spam sushi dog? I can almost imagine him standing in the back rubbing his hands together like Dr. Evil for that one. The brisket sliders and bulgogi tacos are the standouts, but that's almost not saying much when everything on the menu is a standout as well. You could pretty much throw darts at the menu and be blown away by whatever you wound up getting. \n\nIt's a funny spot as it's the roof of a hotel and there's a door guy manning the elevator, so it's hard to know what to expect (I'm a dive bar guy by nature, by far) but let this place win you over for sure.", "author": "Nick D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-11-23", "description": "I know it's thanksgiving but act like the guests at the hotel still deserve great service.  Sat for 15 minutes before going to the bar and being told they were closing soon and not even offering a drink.   We ordered a drink and sat for 30 minutes.  Upon leaving we saw 4 tables of guests who had ordered food AFTER we got there.  Will try another hotel on my next stay.  The girl at the downstairs bar is awesome.   Very accommodating and friendly.   Will not visit the rooftop again.  Went to Jr.s around the corner for drinks.   Very friendly and accommodating staff.

I came here on a Friday night around 9pm for small plates and drinks with some friends. \n\nWe were seated at a table immediately, and the restaurant was moderately full. We had the nachos (amazing), tuna tartare (also good), truffle parmesan fries (good), edamame, shrimp cocktail (good), and all had a few rounds of drinks. The food was great and the prices were high, but you're also paying for the view so we had no complaints about that. The rooftop has views of Brooklyn to the south and also views of the harbor and Statue of Liberty to the west. If I were writing a review based on ambiance/food/drinks alone I'd probably give it 4 stars, but we had a major issue that will ensure I'll never be back and I'll never be recommending Kimoto to anyone. \n\nAround 11pm we were told that we'd have to move closer to the bar at 11:20 as the outdoor portion would be closing. No big deal, that's totally fine. You'd think a rooftop bar would stay open later than 11 on a Friday night in Brooklyn, but that's beside the point. They were very persistent with a couple of workers telling us at least 4 more times that we'd have to move at 11:20. Ok we get the picture, so we moved to a table closer to the bar. Then a server came up to us with major attitude and said \"You must have misunderstood me, they are coming out here with the bleach! You have to move closer to the bar!\" We thought we had moved to a table close enough to the bar, but I guess it wasn't close enough. Honest mistake. His tone was extremely rude and we apologized profusely and moved even closer to the bar. \n\nWe ordered another round of drinks during last call shortly after and closed out our check. We spent over $200 between the 4 of us and tipped generously. All the lights were turned on bright and the music turned down a little before midnight. We knew the servers were trying to close the bar down and get out of there as soon as possible (because we overheard their very intentionally loud conversations amongst themselves). The bar stools were all stacked and almost the entire staff was staring at us and making us feel uncomfortable while we waited for a friend to come out of the bathroom so we could leave. One of the servers said very loudly \"do we need to turn the lights up any brighter?!\" Our drinks and glasses were scooped up and we were on the elevator to get out of there at 12:00 on the dot. I understand that closing time is closing time but it's extremely unprofessional to make customers feel like that. There are nicer ways to make sure the guests leave the bar when it closes. Also, it's a FRIDAY before midnight in NYC and you are a bar. Don't be so shocked that you have customers. \n\nI honestly don't know who the servers/bussers think they are treating people that way. Is the majority of their clientele out-of-towners from the nearby hotels who will likely never be back again, so they feel ok treating them like that? The 4 of us were shocked and appalled at the way we were treated and will never be back. Reading the other reviews, it's clear that this place has major issues and no hospitality. I would stay far away from this place. There are thousands of friendlier bars and restaurants in the city that deserve your business, not Kimoto.", "author": "Halle D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "The location and the staff of this establishment are great and the do was also really great. The actual food was terrible some of our dishes were just disgusting. It is a real shame that the wait for food or even a drink is anywhere from one hour to two three hours all the while you are being given unreasonable excuses. But like I said to its credit it's a nice spot to hangout. The drinks were also not made correctly even when you give the bartender the ingredients they would come back with a drink that was completely off. I thought that was funny!
