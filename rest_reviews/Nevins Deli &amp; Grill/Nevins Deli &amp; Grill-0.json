The people have always been kind and prices are more than fair.  They have a good selection of food, drinks and snacks.  I've had breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches and omelettes - all made very well.   They have been the best when I need an ingredient last minute, they have gone out of their way to get me something they don't normally sell (like an onion or cucumber).  There smoothies are pretty awesome too.", "author": "HanNa W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-11", "description": "The guys behind the register are sexist morons. No matter how hot it is outside, don't ever go in this store and be a female wearing climate appropriate clothing. I walked out of this place thoroughly disgusted and furious. Dehumanizing comments and vile suggestions were made. They were unaware or most likely didn't care that I understand Arabic. Steer clear of this floor rotted roach trap. Spend your money elsewhere.", "author": "Valerie R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "Great  to come to for healthy wraps and good selection if coffee.
