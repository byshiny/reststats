I had half of a whole chicken which wasn't that great and my side options(only side options were broccoli and a dry baked potato) I didn't even bother eating my food as it was cold and tasteless. My kids had mac and cheese and chicken fingers. The chicken fingers were standard however the mac and cheese was really delicious! Why wasn't this an option for pre-fix dinner? The servers were attentive and the cheesecake really was phenomenal! I had the strawberry cheesecake and it was one of the best. Overall nice night due to being w family and cheesecake.

This all changed this past Sunday, where after a movie, friends and I decided to make the trek for a bite [NB: 15-20 min. walk from 106 Court st - so not exactly next door from the cinema]. One of our party had been to Junior's before so explained that it was diner-ish so that set our expectations. It was so very diner-ish.\n\nThe space itself is huge. Huge, huge. \n\nThe front end of the restaurant may have had twenty something tables by itself; the back end past the bar (weirdly situated in the middle of the place) may have had twenty something more plus booth seating. Our waiter, for some reason, decided that we would walk by many of the empty tables upfront and take us to the back. While making our way there we had a good look at many of the other patrons on that Sunday night dinner service. It was a very mixed crowd; from your families to your college kids to your having a drinks with friends. All different shapes, sizes, colors. Nice to see that lived diversity and a shared space across the spectrum [cause, quite frankly most places don't].\n\nNow as far as the food, well, the menu is quite eclectic and having watched way too many reality tv shows based on restaurant rescues; this would be the point where the celebrity chef would complain about how the menu is too broad in scope and they need to have a tighter focus. \n\nI, however, am no celebrity chef. \n\nI simply took note that under \"Sides\" you could get  bagel/cream cheese as well as linguine marinara. You can also find a red snapper, and broiled lobster on top of regular diner fare (your burgers, fried chicken, chicken tenders,  breakfast any hour, etc). So - yes - quite extensive.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken dinner. I was warned that it could take some time but it came out piping hot and in no time at all. It came with two sides which you got to pick some kind of vegetable side (collards, coleslaw) and your choice of potato (french fries, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes). Portion size was jumbo! Three pieces of meaty fried chicken basically half a chicken. Taste was not bad but at 21 bucks for the dinner; a bit price-y.\n\nMy friends were very satisfied with the mac and cheese; the chicken tenders were actual chicken - not frozen bits thrown in a deep fryer; the bacon cheese burger was big enough for two hands and a question on how to eat it.\n\nOverall, Junior's will scratch that diner-itch. Food is quite decent. Service is quick and snappy. And of course, the legendary cheesecake.", "author": "Mike Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-26", "description": "The cheesecakes where delicious. \nI got the wrong cheesecake. But, it was delicious. \n\nThis was my 1st time here. \nAnd, the order I got. Was enough to feed 3 people.

My family and I went and or experience was horrible. Crystal the waitress and waiter we later had were both so rude. The waiter couldn't understand us and we couldn't understand him. He was very slow and not attentive. On to the food... it was tasteless! The burger w/fries tasted the same as my moms seafood platter, a no seasoning taste. My mom sent her food back and I covered mine in ketchup and gave the rest to a homeless lady. Later we found out from people we met in Brooklyn, that you only go to Junior's for the cheesecake. In my opinion, if the food ain't good I don't want the dessert! -From Texas home of seasoning", "author": "Krystal T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "First time every at Juniors, and boy was I pleasantly surprised! Freaking ginormous portions and free appetizers (Cole slaw, bread, beets, cornbread) offset the seemingly high cost of the eggplant Parmesan dish ($14.95 with free soda during lunch). Holy. BTW--this is the only non-breakfast vegetarian entree available. Service is good, and decor is historic. Love the old-school flavor here... It's diner food at huge portions at a reasonable price. What's not to love. \n\nAll of this is completely separate from the Juniors cheesecake--a NYC institution unto itself.

You won't find the cheapest meal here but it will be hearty and good! I ordered the potato pancake, it was the thickest I've ever had!! Great taste!

I most especially like their lunch special which is from 10:45am to 4:30pm on Monday's to Saturday's.  I always end up ordering the Southern fried chicken breast, there's something in the gravy that just hits the spot for me.  \n\nWhat comes next after a tasty meal? Dessert! Don't even get me started on the different kinds of cheesecake they have because I probably won't stop, but I will anyway.  The chocolate cheesecake is so good! So is the devil's food cheesecake, and the chocolate swirl cheesecake.  And of course, I have to give kudos to their milkshake too.  \n\nAs far as the service, never had a problem with the staff.
