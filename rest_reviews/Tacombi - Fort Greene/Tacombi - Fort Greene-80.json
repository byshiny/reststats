My taco was served on my friends plate, and the waiter assumed it was because I ordered it with hers. And then when I told him it was made on a separate order he apologized. Horchata is made out of almond milk. Salsa's aren't what you expect them to be. Chicken tacos weren't too great, shrimp was actually not bad. Tacos are very small. Overall not an extremely bad experience.

The humble aluminum table vibe, reminiscent of a sleepy town, was contradicted by screaming music: the Taco-overpriced at 8$-was swimming in grease: I am sure there are many who will love this place-not me though", "author": "Virginia R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-12-31", "description": "This place looked cute and authentic, and we were expecting a fair and wholesome experience.

The staff was really good.  The food was good but $4.50 for one small taco...it can add up pretty fast.

This place was really bad. The ambiance was ok, but the food so disappointing. May have been the worst quesadilla I have had in my life. Tacos were below average.

El toro, la paquena, Jalapa jar, Cesar's, Havana outpost.

It represents the most predictable form of gentrification you'll find: use the cheapest foldout chairs imaginable to allure gringos with a little sugar in their wallets into the putative \"authenticity\" of the cuisine and then charge them sky-high prices. This is what's known as an extortionist establishment: the kind of place that fools white people into paying anywhere from four to seven dollars for a \"taco\" -- and, by taco, we're talking not a hard shell, but a microscopic tortilla, a size so ridiculously peque\u00f1o that you won't even FIND this in bona-fide enclaves like Sunset Park or true-blue areas of the Bronx. I do have to give these \"We are the 1%\" types some credit on the spices they affixed to the free-range chicken. And the whole culinary three-card monte racket these cads are pulling off takes moxie. But let's not kid ourselves. This is a place that serves as an authenticity surrogate for affluent types too timorous to venture beyond their despicable glass-walled buildings on the East River. I also have a natural aversion to anyone who insists on explaining what types of sauce I need to use on a fucking taco. Folks, this is not rocket science. And if I have any issues understanding the fine distinctions between rojo and verde, I'll ask. Tacombi reminds me of a Chinese reeducation camp -- I mean, I don't have any personal experience, but it wishes to indoctrinate its clients with the established text rather than permitting any method of discovery. And because your pal Johnny is more of an adventurer rather than some brain-dead tourist, he didn't exactly enjoy himself. Still, if you lack an adventurous streak, then Tacombi was made for you. So I suppose it serves some people. But I didn't need to spend so much fucking money on tacos -- I'll tell you that much. They weren't THAT good.", "author": "Johnny H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-12", "description": "This is my new go to spot in fort Greene. Such a great place to eat inside or outside! Love their outside patio especially. They have amazing margaritas and other cocktails.

It was a bit packed so I was told it would be 20 minutes for a seat outside.  Cool I'll wait for it.    So sat at bar and ordered a regular margarita and guacamole.  30 dollars later I get a text that table is ready. Closed out and ready for my outside table but pointed to an inside.  Here comes the bs about \"oh we thought you wanted inside\". Yeah right!  You are saving tables for 2 or more.  Not worth the fight.  Margarita was definitely not worth 13.00 and guacamole was just ok.  This place is a Cardi B restaurant.
