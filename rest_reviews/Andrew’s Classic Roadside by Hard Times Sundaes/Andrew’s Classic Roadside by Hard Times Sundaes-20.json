Half the time they don't have the turkey burger, which is a shame since it's hard to find a good turkey burger in the neighborhood. Quite disappointing walking over the and then losing the crap shoot. \n\nUPDATE: still having way too much trouble keeping those turkey burgers in stock. Honestly, the number of times I've been told they have no turkey makes me wonder why they even put it on the menu. The food is still great when available.", "author": "Daniel S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-05", "description": "Do not understand what is going on with these reviews - I was a big fan of Hard Times Sundaes when it was a food truck in Mill Basin (as in, a big enough fan to actually go to Mill Basin to get it). It was always clear to me that Andrew was making my burger and I always felt he was very respectful of the food, even reverent. I am so happy Hard Times Sundaes has become even more accessible at Dekalb Market.\n\nIf you're paying $17 for a burger, you're doing it wrong. If you have high maintenance requests, you're doing it wrong. If you want to question the motives behind the madness, you're doing it wrong. If you want an unctuous, cheesy burger that would stain your paper bag with grease stains and smell amazing the whole way home, look no further. This burger is truly delicious. If you're interested in trying famous burgers of NYC, you must be sure to include Hard Times Sundaes on your list.", "author": "Rose B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-08-13", "description": "The owner wants you to pay top dollar for a burger.

So we saw some signs for the food court and went on to find it.  We went down the escalator and I went crazy.  It smelled so good.  They had so many different choices. I wanted to try everything, but after the long day a burger and fries was what I really wanted. We got the signature burger and fries.  It was simply awesome.  The fries were thin and crispy, almost like a potato chip.  \n\nEverything was great.  I would come me here and get a burger and fries again.  Also the price we paid seemed like a good value for what we got!", "author": "Ben S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-01-05", "description": "The owner of HTS, Andrew, was extremely rude and abrasive to my friend and I.  I have read articles where he brags about \"running with the bad kids\" and that was very obvious in person.  After ordering some burgers from his, I asked Andrew for a little more information in his burgers.  At this point be became very aggressive for virtually no reason and starting yelling at me.  \n\nIf you look at the other reviews on this thread, it's clear that he has a serious anger problem.  Probably overcompensation for something...but I'll keep it G-rated.\n\nI highly recommend against going here.  It appears that Andrew has no concept of how to give good customer service and, sad to say, the burgers really weren't very good at all.  Shake Shack is much better.", "author": "David K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-29", "description": "This is the perfect burger. \n\nThe chuck has the perfect fat content and is cooked to the perfect temperature resulting in a juicy patty full of flavor held in by the perfect sear. It's perfect.  \n\nThe patty is served on the wonderful Martin's potato roll, arguably the best vessel of all time. Consider any review insulting the potato roll irrelevant.

I ordered the chili and was given a half filled cup of chili.

Slow-yes. Bacon, Egg \u0026 Cheese- the best ive ever had. Hands down.

However, if you took about a 4 block walk west of the market, you'd find yourself at Shake Shake and a better burger. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not touting Shake Shake as the greatest burger, just using it as a comparison. And it's a fair comparison. The burger from Andrew's, or Hard Times Sundaes, I'm not sure which to call it, is a thin, smaller patty (maybe 4 oz) cooked on a flattop, served with American cheese (and bacon in my case) on a Martin's potato bun ... sound familiar? It's a pretty good burger, but nothing special. It comes very close to the beloved by many, Shake Shake, but the burger is just slightly less juicy. I will say this, their bacon is better than Shake Shake, though that isn't much of an accomplishment, considering Shake Shack is rather notorious for undercooking their bacon.\n\nIf you want a truly good burger stop by Brindle Room, Minetta Tavern, or The Spotted Pig ... none of which will be served on the preposterous, Martin's potato bun.", "author": "Mike F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-19", "description": "Rude, dismissive and not at all tasty. My sister and I hit up the Dekalb Market Food Hall last night with high expectations, so imagine our disappointment when she bit into her burger only to be greeted by cheese (not what she ordered) oh, and.....a PIECE OF PLASTIC in her food. \n\nTo add insult to injury,  when she went back to the stand to ask for a replacement,  the cook proceeded to use his gloved hands (the gloves he was using to handle other people's food) to man handle the burger and fries and then accused her of lying. We didn't get a replacement meal, or a refund. Just left the food and walked away.

I asked for a well done burger, and the cashier goes , we don't do well done burgers here. So I asked not even upon request , he says no it's the owner policy. How do even expect to keep customers if you don't even try to accommodate their needs? The burgers are very small \u0026 mediocre if anything with pink blood coming out.
