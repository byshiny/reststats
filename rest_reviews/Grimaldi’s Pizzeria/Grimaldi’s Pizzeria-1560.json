And the service definitely needs improving.\n\nWe originally set out with alternate lunch plans, but came down to Grimaldi's when they didn't pan out as intended.  The line wasn't too bad - just to the end of the building - which by the way, has relocated to the corner storefront.\n\nAfter about a 25 minute wait, we were seated in the far corner of the upstairs dining room.  It took forever to be acknowledged by a server (after several parties seated after us had already placed their orders and received their drinks), but we were ready with our order when he finally came over.  \n\nWe opted for a large \"regular\" pie with pepperoni and fresh garlic.  The \"regular\" only means that your pie is made with tomato sauce, rather than a white pizza (sans sauce).  Our drinks were essentially slammed on the table in front of us, which I didn't really understand, and it was definitely a challenge to order a second round.\n\nThe pie didn't take too long to make it to our table.  The crust was perfect - not too crispy, but not too chewy.  The toppings were relatively well-placed, and the flavor was great.  The large pie was the exact right amount of pizza for our hungry group of 3 (including one bird-like eater).  For larger groups and/or heartier eaters, a second pie is a necessity.\n\nThe pizza itself is the only reason Grimaldi's gets 4 stars from me.  The service makes me want to give 2.5-stars, max.  I understand the place is busy, but Grimaldi's is making money hand-over-fist (and all cash, at that!), so hire a couple more servers (or give them some customer-service training) so your patrons can have a pleasant dining experience, and be eager to return!  Our server's slamming the drinks on our table without any regard to who ordered what really bothered me, as did the fact that quite a few other tables in our general vicinity were treated with a helluva lot more courtesy.", "author": "Eve C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-28", "description": "Was very disappointed with the pizza.

This place has a lot of hype and the lines that come with it but we were seated within 10 minutes on Sunday around 2pm.  \n\nIt's clearly a pizza production and I felt our pie was inconsistent in dough thickness and charred vs uncharred areas but that's probably to be expected with turning pizzas at such a high pace. Like I said, I like this style pizza so no harm by me. \n\nI would definitely put it above DiFara's.. maybe tied with Frank Pepe.\n\nPS - why can't i have a beer with my pizza here though?!", "author": "Cailin M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-31", "description": "I think I've figured out their business model: make everyone wait outside in line for two hours, have them starve to death, then serve them pizza and they will automatically say it's good.\n\nThe pizza really is THAT good, but I really can't tell if that's the hunger or taste buds talking. \n\nNonetheless, you have been warned.

Great location near the piers.  Reasonably priced around $14 depending on toppings for a large.  Crust is thin, but thick enough to keep its shape and prevent flopping. \n\nThe Long:\nI came here with a couple friends after first going to Lombardi's to compare the two of the best acclaimed pizzas in New York.  I have to say that Grimaldi's won the competition.  We got there around 6 on a saturday and there actually was no line.  We were told to go upstairs and see Frank.  Sure enough Frank was waiting and got us seated.  We ordered a large sausage pizza and it took a little while for it to come out so know that you might have to wait a little bit.  The crust was delicious.  It was a good thin crust, but it didn't fall apart (like Lombardi's did).  The sausage, cheese, and sauce were really good quality and quite tasty and there was a good balance of topping to cheese and sauce.  Overall a great experience and a must try if you're in Brooklyn.  It's easy on the budget too. The only thing Lombardi's has over Grimaldi's is that their sauce is a little more flavorful and sweeter.  Other than that my vote goes to Grimaldi's!", "author": "Greg M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "Had friends visit from out of town, and there is not better NY experience than NY pizza so we decided to do our one touristy thing for the weekend and do Brooklyn bridge and Grimaldis.\nWe arrived at 11:35 (opens at noon) and we were at the front of the line, probably within the first 15 people so when it opened at noon we were seated right away. Ordered all white pie, and regular with mushroom and onion. We all liked the all white the best, so maybe worth giving it a whirl! \nCash only, so prepare yourself for that.\nOverall it was good for a touristy thing to do, we all liked it and had a great time.

Umm the only thing that they never bring up is that it's CASH ONLY! My friends and I made the trek here from Manhattan to try this glorious pizza place out.\n\nWe got here around 5, and there was a short but not terrible line. We got SUPER lucky though because they were looking for a 3 party group to seat, so we only waited in line for about 5-8 minutes! Sat down and we already knew what we wanted, large pizza w/ mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, italian sausage and pepperoni. It took about half an hour to come out, and it seemed even longer becuase we were all hungry.\n\nFinally the pizza came out and it looked gooooooooooood. I had to warn my friends not to not to dig in until I managed to snap a picture! The pizza was good, but to be honest I wasn't blown away...  the crust wasn't crispy or crunchy, I'm not sure if it's a NY thing, but I had expected more texture and less.. mushy. BUT, besides that the pizza was good. It came out piping hot, there was a bunch of delicious fresh mozzerella, the tomatoes were good and overall very enjoyable! It just wasn't life changing, I guess I hyped it up for myself. Something good to keep in mind when trying out this place.\n\nOverall not a bad experience, but I'm not sure it would be worth the long wait (that I didn't have to endure). The price was good, it came out to about $10 per person and that's with tip! I recommend going over at off hours so the line isn't as long.

I went there in the afternoon and was faced with the typical long line (quoted 40 min. wait).  Since I was by myself they took me in right away and sat me at the counter, which I thought was great.  However, I sat there for 10-15 minutes without anyone acknowledging me even though a number of different servers walked behind the counter in front of me.  I finally said something and someone came over to take my order.  The service was subpar to say the least.  My interaction with my server totaled about one minute for my entire meal. It seems like they are so used to being extremely busy, and dealing with a lot of tourists, that they just don't care. Maybe I caught them at a bad time.  I hope it's not that bad all of the time.\n\nAs far as the pizza goes, I thought it was just average. I ordered a Regular (tomato sauce, cheese and basil). I know the coal oven is supposed to be special but I really didn't think it was worth all the hype or for a long wait.  I've had a lot of wood fire pizzas and various artisinal pizzas that I thought were much, much better.\n\nIf you're in the area and have time to kill, go for it.
