The fries come with this addicting spicy mayo. \n\nI highly recommend getting the special sauce burger if it's your first time at a vegan place. The burger tasted pretty meaty even tho I'm guessing it's made with soy. And the cheddar cheese tasted really nice. It is not a 100% imitation to an actual cheese burger, but it's one of the closest I've tasted.\n\nThe signature burger was also tasty but it's more of the typical vegetarian burger. It look like it is made with quinoa and beans.\n\nOverall a solid vegan burger place!", "author": "Siyun Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-21", "description": "Craving a burger'n fries we stumbled upon Next Level Burger a fast food vegan friendly burger joint. We were quite surprised at the quality of the vegan food. I ordered the Classic Savory Meaty Patty topped with Dill Pickles, Ketchup, Yellow Mustard and Egg-Free Mayo. As a new vegan I still crave meat and I'll tell you I could not tell the difference!\n\nStaff: very friendly and helpful when asking questions about menu items. \n\nEnvironment: located in the Whole Foods food court there is plenty of seating and a great view of Downtown Barclays area. WiFi available \n\nPricing: I would say for the quality of food you get the prices are respectable. \n\nIf you are craving fast food that is healthy this is the place to go even for non-vegans", "author": "Brian C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-14", "description": "I've been quite a few times. My initial review draft was a--5-star, completely lost my s* because there's a vegan restaurant off the 4 train. \n\nBut after several visits, I've calmed down quite a bit. Still above average solely on the premise that they're filling an otherwise downtown BK vegan restaurant void. This chain is also not new to the game and has other locations out West, so I'm giving my warmest NY welcome. \n\nA few things or just one thing: lots of options, not enough flavor. It's as if in their effort to offer an interesting menu, they skimped on the flavor. I've tried 3 burgers and two loaded fries and all were good enough, but on the blander not quite memorable side. I most recently tried the Signature burger, which was the best yet. I believe it's served with ranch which is far better than the \"special\" sauce which leaves a lot to be desired. \n\nShake wise, the brownie explosion is my fave and they're rather generous with the portions. While I haven't tried the beer as yet, I do appreciate the offerings. I'll be here again in spite of the shortcomings, mainly for the Signature burger. I can do without the fries.", "author": "Racquel B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-12-04", "description": "On a scale of 1-10 I was a solid 10 on the excitement scale when I saw next level burger in Whole Foods. Based on their social media the burgers looked extremely similar to veggie grill in the west coast, so needless to say I was pumped. \n\nSad to say that I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the burger. The buns were dry, the burger tasted like it was out of the microwave and the blue cheese was ehhh. \n\nFor being in a Whole Foods, they lacked quality and freshness. I'm not sure if it was the location or what but there was so much potential here and they came up short.", "author": "Christina H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-04", "description": "Late on evening....maybe it was a Saturday, I walked into this spot and began to peruse the menu. Oddly enough I did not notice the that this spot specialized in vegan options, I just thought there had healthy options which made me smile.\n\nAs I stood there confused, the gentleman at the register notice and offered his advice. He mentioned that he isn't vegan but he still enjoys the food here because YOU CANT TASTE THE DIFFERENCE!!!! Let that sink in for a second. Let's say you love bacon cheese burgers like Quincy (I'm Quincy btw) but you're also lactose intolerant like Quincy, chances are you get annoyed when you want a burger and \"can't\" have one.... this place fixes that problem. The burger I ordered, you couldn't tell me that there wasn't beef, bacon, and cheese in there nor could you tell me that there wasn't pieces of chocolate in my cookies and cream milkshake.\n\nI sat there happily enjoying a bacon cheese burger and cookies and cream milkshake.... this place is amazing.\n\nThe staff is helpful and cool a shell.\nThe food taste like the non-vegan alternative.\nThe prices aren't bad.\nLastly, no bathroom issues later lol.

Ive been procrastinating about trying it but after my family raved about it, I thought I better try it. Also, I shop in the Whole Foods in the same building and it smells AMAZING. \n\nWe had a Signature and and Original. I love the wholesome fresh taste and I really love the fact that no animals got hurt just so we could have a meal. I like the sauce, which is unusual for me. \n\nWe had fries and tator tots. Get the tator tots. They are warm and crunchy (my favorite) with the perfect salty seasoning.\n\nThe people are very friendly and gracious.

Loved the menu options. I had the chili hot dog but asked that all the extras be held back just the chili please. It wasn't bad at all but the chili definitely could have used more flavor. Kendal, my daughter had the chicken sandwich, think Chik fil a. She enjoyed it and we both loved the fries, mine sweet potato and hers crinkle.

Does the populace really want vegan burgers?  I guess so!\n\nI've only been once, but found my burger - one of the special menu ones - to be quite good. Was it good for the price?  Not really, I think these are quite expensive for what you get, but I cannot say that I wasn't satisfied with the taste and meal. We got tater tots along with our meal, and those were mighty tasty.  That this was all vegan is a treat though, well making the wait, and even the price, pretty acceptable.  \n\nThe staff were cool and handled the bevy of customers well.

The place is located inside the Whole Foods near the Barclay's Center, so it took my friend and I a while to find it but the hunt was totally worth it. As a vegetarian, I love a good vegan/vegetarian burger that's not just a bunch of lettuce and tomatoes in between a bun, and Next Level Burger did not disappoint. I ordered the Spicy Bean with a side of tater tots. The burger was HUGE and the whole meal really filled me up for what I paid. The wait time was not long either...it took about 10-15 minutes from the time we placed our order to receive the food.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with the meal and the overall place.

Now I'm not a vegan, I'm a baby pescatarian, but I been here twice already and I must say it is still abslutely amazing. The first time I tried the Beyond Burger which was really good. The 2nd time I tried the classic chzburger and that was amazing as well. Only thing is they didn't put the special sauce on the chzburger but no big deal. Now the item that I can not resist is the Vanilla Shake with coconut instead of soy. It is aaaaamazing. Better than any shake from McDonald's, Burger King even Starbucks (I'm not exaggerating). This shake was so thick and so delicious it was worth every penny. I wish they had larger cups. \n\nAltogether the food is very filling. Very worth it. Taste exactly like meat, but is way healthier.
