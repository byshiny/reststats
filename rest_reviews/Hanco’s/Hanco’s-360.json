It is just perfect: fresh baguette with a nice crunch and a bunch of delicious meat and veggies (getting hungry as I'm writing this) and nicely priced for a great lunch. My team orders from Hanco's all the time, and every time it takes a bit longer than I'd like. Understandably so, Hanco's is located at least 15-20 min (walk) from my office.

The pho was just okay - a little too salty for my taste. Also, I was disappointed that the combo rolls were pre-made and placed in a styrofoam plate with plastic wrap.

I was going to a medical assistant school nearby and would come here for lunch. MY usual order was always the pork sandwich, extra spicy and coconut bubble tea.

At first sight, the perfect marriage of love and happiness is very apparent.  However, as the marriage deepened, the arguing started.  The meat (very juicy, I might add) and the veggies(very crunchy, I add again) decided they want to stand alone.  So I had to play the role of marriage counselor and bring some damage control into the situation.  I'd rather spend my time on more pressing issues, but my stomach was yelling at me, my eyes saw cilantro and I'm not gonna take a star away for that....no sirree bob!\n\n*eyes wide, happy voice*.....Marry me, Banh Mi!!!", "author": "Ava H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-16", "description": "This place is a huge disappointment. The vegetarian pho came with 3 pieces of broccoli, and the broccoli was tasteless and old. The classic sandwich was terrible - the bread was stale and the meat not fresh. The staff was nice but when the food is horrible it's just not worth it.

I would ask for extra hot cause the emphasis on the Vietnamese mayonnaise makes for a pretty tame sandwich. \n\nMy main gripe, and the only reason for 3 stars is that the place closes so damn early, even on weekends. With its location on Smith st, Hancos should be ideal for drunken late night visits, but just like everything else on Smith except diners, its closed.\n\nalso I would say that Hancos is basically identical to Nicky's on Atlantic, and since both close so early its a wash.", "author": "Geoff C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-09", "description": "Fantastic sandwich shop and the iced coffee is perfect.

My boyfriend and I are both vegetarian and they have tons of options for us - vegetarian pork, vegetarian chicken, tofu or just vegetables.

It wasn't terrible but it was nothing like the amazing BBQ chicken sandwich Baoguette does in the East Village. My husband was also disappointed with his sandwich, nothing special.\n\nWe also ordered drinks- Vietnamese iced coffee and a coffee bubble tea. Both were WAY too strong and I usually love strong coffee. I drank it anyway and was super jittery and felt sick afterwards. \n\nMaybe we just had an off day but from now on I'm sticking to Baoguette.\n\nSofie", "author": "Sofie W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-17", "description": "It was time to order dinner and my vegan boss and I (vegetarian here) were on the prowl for some yummy veggie eats in Boerum Hill.

The pickled daikon and carrots were deliciously tart, sweet, and crisp. The cucumber and cilantro were refreshing to the palette and the mayo mixed in with the spicy goodness was soooo yum! The vegetarian chicken was cooked well and there was plenty of it.\n\nAll in all, this sandwich was amazing. I also tried the veggie pork one the next day for lunch (yup, we're addicts now!) and it was also very good though I preferred the veggie chicken. The faux pork had an interesting sweet after taste that kind of threw me off but that was the only downside to that sandwich.\n\nNow I'm just counting down the minutes until lunch today so I can have me some more banh mi!", "author": "Tatiana E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-07", "description": "The tapioca in the bubble tea was not sufficiently cooked and they got the order wrong.", "author": "Alex H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-10", "description": "I got the Vietnamese pork sandwich and rice vermicelli salad via delivery from Seamless and was SO impressed.

As a vegan, I am grateful that they are willing to leave off the mayo and butter on the vegetarian chicken, or tofu sandwhiches (which are my standards). I also always always get the garden rolls. Its like salad I get to dip in peanut butter, nothing better. However, I am only giving them 3 stars because even if you eat in, they serve the rolls on styrofoam. Not cool.

They prepare the tapioca bubbles in front of you at the counter, so it's as \"fresh\" as it can get. The taro tea in itself was delicious and reasonable priced ($4.25 for a medium size), but I thought the boba was a little too sweet and there was too much of it.
