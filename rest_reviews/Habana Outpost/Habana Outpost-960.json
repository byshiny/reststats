Fun place for groups.  Excellent corn on the cob.", "author": "Tim R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-19", "description": "Who knew this spot was located just 5 minutes behind my old high school? wish I knew it was there back then (or was it? I don't know..that's beside the point..) Anyway, tried their \"specialty\" roasted corn..good but nothing amazing..just your average roasted corn with a heap of grated dry parm with what looks like paprika. For $2, it's worth getting as a side. Now onto the Cuban sandwhich..now it's my first time having one oft these so I have nothing to compare it to, but this leaves a great impression for a first timer..it wasn't out of this world amazing but it was damn good. The pickles really brought out the flavor of the pork and the bread. The guac and chips were mediocre, I'll order mine @ Chipotle instead..we waited about 10 minutes for a seat outdoors (because it is unbearably humid and hot indoors) when we got there at 7. It's first come first serve..they are very quick with the food! I really like the eco-friendy set-up and casual outdoors dining area..great place to just chit chat and munch on food with a few good friends.", "author": "Ben C."}], "servesCuisine": "Cuban", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Habana Outpost", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "757 Fulton St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/rxwbl8jMokqJA9gp4m7H5Q/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188589500"}
