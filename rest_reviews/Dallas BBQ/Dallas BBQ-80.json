A bunch of premade crap. With these prices at the very least make my food fresh. The shrimp taste like the oil needs to be changed, ribs overcooked and rice dry.

The local wildlife seem to have no manners or etiquette what so ever I understand people get excited over affordable large drinks but it sounds like an animal house. You cant even take a date there because you'll be screaming to each other just to talk for no reason because of the ratchet types that frequent this location. The food is good and wings and drinks always on point just wish there was a bit more control on the crowd and it would be perfect", "author": "Billye D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-04", "description": "The wait for this restaurant was around 25-30 minutes. It was packed and very noisy. This is the type of place you could show up in sweatpants and a sweatshirt and no one would care, that's just how casual it is. The music playing differed from R\u0026B or country, to pop or rap. \n\nWe got the sweet and sour shrimp, vegetable Tempura, and crab cakes. The shrimp was actually pretty good, the crab ok, but the Tempura was a disappointment. It was flavorless and I regret wasting money on it. \n\nFor our entrees we ordered a veggie burger, the steak chicken shrimp combo, and the shrimp with salmon. Entrees come with either rice, a baked potato, fries, or a side of salad. I got the veggie burger which was made with beans and it was pretty average. It was topped with salsa, cheese, and a good amount of lettuce. My side was a baked potato which came still still wrapped in the aluminum foil and completely un-seasoned. Though it was very filling I won't remember it a couple of days from today. \n\nI heard the salmon was pretty good and the people who ordered it got a huge serving of fries with it. \n\nThe only non-vegetarian at the table got the meat combo which came on a huge plate and was unable to be finished. According to them the chicken was completely flavorless. They took one bite and couldn't continue. They said the same of the steak and corn bread. Their meal also came with a ridiculously large serving of French fries that they barely made a dent in. \n\nThere are no deserts on the menu but as a way to composite for it, tiny cupcakes come at the end of the meal. The drinks came in huge \"Texas\" sized cups and there was a very limited food/drink selection for kids. \n\nTo conclude, the food was average to below average. If your starving and want a quick bite then coming here is ok but don't come if you want a good mind blowing meal. \n\nPs: Dieters beware. This place is NOT diet friendly and there are barely any vegetarian options.", "author": "Jade K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-09", "description": "**Early Bird Lunch Special Overview** Although I am giving BBQ's(as we call it) a 3 star rating, I really enjoyed myself here. It dawned on me the other week BBQ's had an Early Bird lunch special. I was in the Boerum Hill/Park Slope area and was reminded of this. I had had it once before here and left pleasantly surprised and FULL. Part 2. I read a menu somewhere that said that the lunch special is $8.99. Nice. But when I got there, the menu stated that it was...*drumroll*....$7.99. Joy! It consists of a cup of a hearty chicken vegetable soup, 1/2 chicken, cornbread and your choice of baked or french fried potatoes or yellow rice. You can have your chicken honey dipped, barbecue basted, and even be entirely white meat, for an additional $1-$2. No add-ons for me as the table provided a barbecue sauce and this time around I wanted to taste the meat. Still salivating over the price, I couldn't get over the fact that I was eating for so cheap. And then I ordered the Pi\u00f1a Colada....*drumroll*....for $8.99. Ughhhh. And it was virgen and Texas-sized. It was great and refreshing and served quickly but I left a good amount of it. I kind of wished I just settled for a Coke. The chicken was dry, Folks. As I forked through the flesh, I did get some bites that were juicy. The outside layer of the chicken was sort of rough. I attribute this to the meat being under a heater for however long just waiting to be chosen. I began to kick myself for not exploring any of the add-ons. My sweet server did mention that the barbecue sauce on the table was different then the add-on one. The table one was liquidy and resembled a no-frills industrial kind. Still kicking myself. My baked potato was standard. The sour cream provided was da BOMB though. And it may be packaged, but it elevated my baked potato with it's subtle tartness and cooling note. I wished my cornbread was warm. Hell, I'd take room temperature. My fantasy of warm cornbread melting a smear of butter was euthanized. This special is only offered from M-Th and from 11am-1230pm and again from 2pm-5pm. And they were playing the jamz on their TV sets. I caught myself dancing and eating and not caring. After asking for the check, I was greeted with a cute little cupcake. So you see, this rating is a strong 3 borderline 4. I would have to explore the menu more. And I saw that they just added a Chicken and Waffles to the menu. Which guarantees that I will be back very soon.", "author": "Jason T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-31", "description": "In town with some colleagues for work and were looking for a quintessential Brooklyn place to have dinner at.  Not sure this is it but the restaurant was really busy especially for a Thursday so we agreed to check it out even though we had a short wait to be seated.\n\nThere are a bunch of TVs around the restaurant that made watching March Madness easy and comfortable. \n\nDrinks were awesome.  Good selection of beer and a number of us had specialty frozen drinks which are huge and tons of fun.  Great idea for the restaurant to promote these drinks.  They really add to the atmosphere and as I watched other tables receive their drinks it always resulted in additional excitement.  I recommend the Pina Colada!\n\nFood was good.  Not amazing BBQ but certainly very good.  We had ribs, chicken and a pulled pork Burger (which is a beef Burger with pulled pork on it).  Huge helpings of fries accompanies everything and the cornbread that comes on every plate adds an extra southern kick!\n\nServing sizes at the restaurant are very large. No need for an appetizer.  Nobody left hungry.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the wait staff always seemed to have other things to do.  They were always very nice and made a point of apologizing whenever they came to see us but we waited for every part of our meal: drink order, drinks to arrive, food order, food to arrive, and bill to come.  It definitely put a bit of a damper on the experience.  \n\nNote that this restaurant automatically adds 15% to your bill as a service charge.  Upside is that you don't need to think too much about how much to tip.  Downside is that the waitstaff have little incentive to make sure you're taken care of during your visit.  Was apparent to us.\n\nWill be back next time were in town but because of the atmosphere and the drinks.  This was a truly fun place to have dinner.  Food was good but it is lots of other places too.  Helpings were big.  Service was lacking but maybe that was just the night we were there.", "author": "Jim P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-19", "description": "Food was great and drinks we're liqoured up unlike the Manhattan 8th ave location.

The drinks are amazing and the good is good. They have a bar menu with wings, burgers and sandwiches but they also have ribs. I had a henny burger and it was outstanding. The sauce was like bbq sauce with a pleasant twist. I had the moscato mama frozen drink and loved it. The service was amazing and we got there at a good time so there was no wait. I'm looking forward to going back and trying the henny wings. All the food going to other tables looked delicious so I want to try more menu items. I always get burgers or just drinks. The drinks are in a class by themselves. It's their best feature in my opinion. Lots of variety and delicious. They're not afraid to put alcohol in a slushy drink so they're alright with me. I wish they were in more states. I am a loyal fan and will always stop in while visiting NYC.", "author": "Celeta S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-05", "description": "Food was very tasty and affordable!

And this particular location usually takes a while to get a table? Why? Because they are good! Food is delicious, drinks are phenomenal, especially when you Texas-size your drink. I'm a sucker for their Long Island ice tea with some bubbly and extra shot added to my drink . While waiting for a table can be a pain, it is worth it. Get a lot of grub for your buck. Never leave hungry. And if you order ribs and chicken, make sure to ask for extra napkins and wipes. Your fingers will get sticky, you're tempted to wipe on your clothes lol.

There's been times where I've ordered \u0026 was given something different. Their response times are also ridiculous.

I called to inquire on whether or not the food would be delivered \u0026 I was placed on hold for four minutes.
