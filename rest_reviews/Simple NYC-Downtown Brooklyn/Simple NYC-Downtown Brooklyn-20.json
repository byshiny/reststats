The place was neat and cozy and we felt great after eating as it's relatively healthy and have that home cooking feel. The service was also surprisingly noteworthy esp for a Cantonese establishment (disclaimer: I'm Cantonese). This place has ascended to one of my favorite spots in my neighborhood as the value it delivers exceeded the price so I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Kobe L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-08", "description": "Really happy that I stopped here for a casual dinner! The service is fantastic and answered all of the questions I had about the food. I ended up getting a raw salmon bowl \u0026 all the individual ingredients were delicious in their own way whether it's the fish (v fresh) or seaweed (so savoury). The decor itself is incredibly fancy and they have a great rewards program (buy 8 get 1 free). Really happy with the price too. Definitely stop by if you're craving some poke!!!", "author": "Rose L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-21", "description": "I recently tasted Poke at work, and decided I wanted to eat it tonight for dinner.

I live in the area and used to get wikiwiki but it's a bit overpriced and it's small. Simple is so good!! Got the ahi tuna and salmon poke.

The owners are super friendly, courteous, and helpful. The poke bowls are probably the best I've had in the city. The portions are massive, you have a choice of rice/quinoa/salad bases, and each bowl is a treasure trove of ingredients. Hubby and I have tried the octopus, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and ahi tuna and none have disappointed. They are also the most affordable poke bowls I've come across.

Well the wait is over because Simple NYC is exactly what we've been waiting for. It's good fresh ingredients in a well portioned bowl. They even have cooked salmon bowls for those not ready to plunge into the raw fish food world.
