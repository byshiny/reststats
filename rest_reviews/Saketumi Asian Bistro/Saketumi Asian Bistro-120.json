Some of the biggest sushi rolls I've seen, very fast delivery, and super cheap. Will definitely be ordering again!", "author": "Jake F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-18", "description": "I went here with my boyfriend for lunch and we loved it! It was a warm day and we were put outside in the garden, and it was very lovely. The waitress was great and kind, I believe her name is Jenny. She came every few minutes to make sure we were doing well, as well as refill our waters. We really enjoyed our experience here. We ordered edamame and shumai to start, and both were delicious! Our entrees were the chicken teriyaki which came with vegetables, soup or salad, and rice. I ordered shrimp with vegetables and brown rice. Both entrees were delicious and satisfying. The best part is that its next to the promenade which we went to afterwards. Overall, great business, food and service. Will definitely be coming back!", "author": "Daniella L."}], "servesCuisine": "Sushi Bars", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Saketumi Asian Bistro", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "118 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CoHUWHgBTlas-BrfkcKkDw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188558688"}
