While it wasn't in the patio, but at the shared table, we didn't mind at all, no one else was seated next to us! \n\nThe ambiance was perfect for us, quiet enough to chat, but not dead silent where we could hear each other's chewing. The wine and beer list were perfect since we had just walked over 13 miles and really needed that drink. The food came out so quickly, but we were grateful. We never felt rushed or anything else. All in all, the food was superb and not at a wallet-breaking price. I recommend this place", "author": "Eric L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-05", "description": "I'd rate this spot 4.5 stars.\n\nThis spot serves top-notch brick-oven pizza with a yummy char. The pizza is a great mix between soft and crispy., and they offer a wide variety of specialty pizzas. My fave is the Laura, which comes with tomatoes, mozzarella, mascarpone, speck, and rosemary. They don't take reservations, but if you're only a party of two you should be able to snag a bar spot while you're waiting.", "author": "Kerry G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-12", "description": "Look. Eating pizza when you're gluten free is sad. Most of the offerings you find are thin crust, overly crispy, and weirdly sticky. Sottocasa is the only place I've found that makes a *chewy* and flavorful GF crust.\n\nTiny science lesson: the thing that makes bread based products chewy is the gluten. That protein does magic stuff and that's how you get bagels and perfect brownies and naan. Making chewy items without gluten is hard. (There are no gf bagels I've ever tasted that come close to the real thing.) So when I mention that this pizza crust is chewy, I want you to understand the unicorn status it upholds. I have no idea how they do it, but I can enjoy real quality pizza, and I will never stop throwing money at them for that. I adore this place.", "author": "Em A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-30", "description": "Very light, tasty pizza. I think it really emodies the thin-crust, New York style pizza. I got the margherita pizza and ate the whole thing by myself. The service was very personal, with the server calling me \"se\u00f1orita\" and checking on me periodically. The ambience of the restaurant would be nice for a date, a little dimly lit with candles on the tables. My only complaint is that my crust was slightly burnt in places, so I had to peel off some black parts. Overall, this was a great place for dinner in Brooklyn!", "author": "April H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-17", "description": "Nice little neapolitan pizzeria. Not much to add to the positive reviews but to the ignorant Americans who keep complaining about it being soggy, or it being a pizza bianca (without tomato sauce) or a pizza rossa (without cheese) please get a clue. It's such a spectacularly insular and beef-witted thing to say. Contrary to the world view of many Americans - America hasn't really invented much in the culinary realm, they just repackage/rebrand food from \"old world\" cultures. There is actually an entire world out there; a world much older than America where they have been doing these foods for centuries before America was even a thing. So trying to act like a pizza connoisseur because you're a new yorker is idiotic and cringeworthy. You don't like pizza being soggy in the middle - fine, everyone has their own tastes and preferences but to assert that a pizza is bad because of that characteristic is the height of insularity. Go to a NY pizza place instead. Don't go to an actual authentic pizza place. Naples did it first, they invented pizza, the way they do it is the definitive form, it's that simple. \n\nNY pizza is amazing (personally i love it, sometimes just as much as Neapolitan pizza) but it will always be just an imitation of that original, get over it.", "author": "Tommaso S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-20", "description": "Absolutely without a doubt the best pizzeria in NY. This cozy place excells in hospitality, service, and food quality. The pizza is amazing,  perfect dough, cooked just right and with a lot of flavour. Friendly but corteus and pofessional service. Many restaurant should take example from this one.

I would rate it four and a half stars.\n\nThe crust of the pizza stands out the most to me. The edge is one of the best if not the best that I've tried. It is soft and airy, yet it is crispy with a delicate char. The inner crust was a little too soft. The pizza we ordered had mozzarella , mascarpone, and speck. The oils from these three ingredients were released and pooled in the center of the pizza making it flimsy in the center. After the first bite, the rest of the pizza held together very well.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Nutella pizza. It had the same delicious crust except it was crispier throughout. I'd recommend both the Nutella pizza and the Laura pizza.\n\nSottocasa also has a handful bottles from Italian microbreweries. They were a bit pricey, yet it was interesting to try a craft beer from Italy. Moreover, it was a bit unfortunate that they were out of about half of the bottles on the menu.", "author": "Joseph T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-06", "description": "This is one of my favorite pizza places in NYC! I'm never in the mood for pizza (always pasta first), but this restaurant has changed that. I've been back already 3 times in this last month!!!\n\nEveryone there is super friendly, and the service is so quick. On a less busy night, I feel like we ordered, and got our pizzas in no time! \n\nMy favorite is the Prosciutto Crudo, I have ordered it every time. Portions wise, I like splitting 2 pizzas with one other person, but it's quite filling.", "author": "Amber C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-06", "description": "AMAZING!

Perfect portion for two. For the pizza we had one with spicy sausage \u0026 basil. Perfection. Ordered a latte that was beautiful but no way to drink it without it gushing over the sides and was way too milky. For desert, since we felt virtuous for splitting a pizza we tried the special: described as panne cotta with a raspberry sauce. It was too firm (hard flavorless jello) with a wonderfully delicious strawberry sauce. Stick to salad and pizza and you'll be thrilled.", "author": "Laura W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-13", "description": "We went at 10pm on a rainy Saturday evening and walked in and got a table straight away.

Overhyped. Just another one of those hipster Brooklyn Neopolitan pizza places that get rave reviews from people that don't know what good pizza is supposed to taste like. \n\nBeer selection is eh at best. Had a decent option or two. \n\nOrdered two pies. One white and the other with sausage mushroom and gorgonzola. For starters, there is wayyy to much crust on these things. Especially for that size. Toppings are also pretty skimpy on the white. Not consistently covered with cheese so you can have an entire slice with barely any cheese on it. \n\nSauce was tasteless and the pizza couldn't even withhold its own weight. They were both soggy and difficult to eat. Did not taste good. No one at the table enjoyed it. The sausage pizza actually had pool of liquid sitting under it. Fell apart quickly and clearly no bite or crunch to any of it outside of the crust which while had nice color, did not taste like anything. \n\nNot recommended for the food alone. Staff was fine though. Perfectly nice and no complaints there", "author": "Riy E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-05", "description": "Another tremendously fantastic experience at Sottocasa.

The pizza crusts were slightly charred, thin, and crunchy. Both pizzas were tasty, paired with red wine, it was a great meal. The salad was light, crisp, and fresh.
