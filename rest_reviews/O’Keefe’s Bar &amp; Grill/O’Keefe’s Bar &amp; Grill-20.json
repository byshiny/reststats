I'm originally from Minneapolis where bars often have, well, bar food. Not so much here but O'Keefe's most certainly does and it's good. It isn't fancy and it isn't gastro spotted anything, but the food is quite good and comes out quickly so you can have lunch and get back to work or jury duty or whatever. I like the chili (bean or beef) which is your bargain yet filling dish. There is a salad special everyday and those are good as well. The caesar is no joke. Plus the service is great. The bartenders will chat you up or leave you alone - whichever you prefer. Note that if the bar and tables are full there is seating upstairs, though you would never guess it.", "author": "Matt J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-16", "description": "I came to O'keefe's Bar and Grill many many years ago. I remembered how delicious the hot wings were. Just recently went back and the wings did not disappoint. The medium wings are so tasty. I would agree with the some of the writers, The wings are one of the best I had. Addicting taste. The wings are about the only thing I order along with my beverage of choice. Nice crowd. Never had a challenge with service but there could be a little more happiness coming from the staff but the wings make up for that. To this, is why I give the 5 stars. Parking in the neighborhood is very, very slim, I mean very. Great spot for lunch or hang out after work. Not too many real bars in the neighborhood quite like this one. Great spot to watch sports... TV's all around. Definitely get the Wings.....Cheers!!!!", "author": "Irene B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-20", "description": "Best place to go if you work nearby and need somewhere chill for lunch. Everyone in the courts come here to eat and relax. The bartenders are super nice. Their wraps are not necessarily your typical wrap. They are like a wide burrito that you kind of need to eat with a fork and knife! Their chicken fingers are great. Perfect spot to go for lunch/after work that has a relaxed ambiance but still fun.", "author": "Tee J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-11-14", "description": "I few times a been in these place. I guess it's the only bar in Court st. But I have to said their alcoholic drinks are mix with lot of juice and ice like water. I end up spending lot of money when I see the bill.

I decided to plop my butt down at O'Keefe's Bar \u0026 Grill to enjoy a burger and brew and read \"The Dark Side of Lyndon Baines Johnson\", a book everyone should read.\n\nA pleasant young female server greeted me in the dining area.After she patiently answered my questions about the respective merits of two Sierra Nevada brews, I chose the Pale Ale.\n\nIt came just as I like it: cold, refreshing and delicious. I ordered a Bacon \u0026 Cheddar Burger. The 8 ounce beauty arrived perfectly medium as requested. It was full of mineral flavor and luscious, making my taste buds do Karaoke.The generous portion of accompanying fries were of the crisp variety. They were tasty and not greasy.\n\nFor those of you under 40, the key to understanding the 1963 coup is googling \"Lyndon ducks\".

It had been recommended to me, so I was happy to check it out - however, I was VERY disappointed. \n\nAwful service - we weren't drinking, but our waitress never came to refill our waters. Perhaps we were ignored since we were just eating and not boozing? Not ok. \n\nThe food was fine, nothing special. They made me a buffalo chicken wrap despite it not technically behind on the menu - that was nice. It was good. Again, the service was the issue. \n\nFinally, the juke box was playing SO LOUDLY over the speakers that I couldn't think or pay attention to the basketball game.

It has always been a super chill spot to hang out, grab a beer or some grub.\n\nA very unassuming atmosphere with amazing bouncers and bartenders. The waitresses are another story, it's often a hit or miss with them.\n\nSometimes, they'll be spot on in terms of service and knowledge on what the specials actually are. Other times, a couple are in a dizzy, fluttering about to no where with a lack of attention to details on service and your order.\n\nOne particular waitress had the audacity in positioning her self to educated me on 'tipping' before I left. I was seriously offended  (as I work in the hospitality business), I'm known to be overly generous when I leave gratuities.  I did express to her \"... not to allow the brown skin to fool her\".\n\nAside from that incident, it's always a grand time. I also came here on St. Patrick's day to celebrate. I usually have the sampler, which is quite good (nothing five stars) but it's bar food and washes down easy with beers or Margaritas.\n\nI wished I lived in the area, I'd be here weekly.

Once inside, it was warm and didn't have the typical beer soaked bar top smell, which so many old bars have.

Lots of TVs, perfect for watching sports. I got a dirty martini and it was perfect. I know it's sounds like not a big deal, but I've got  my shares of bad dirty martinis. The burger was also really good, the bun stayed firm and the cheese was not extra $$. It was an tasty, high quality American burger with pickles, onion, a leaf of lettuce and cheese your  choice for $11, what's not to like? The sweet potatoes fries were fried just right.
