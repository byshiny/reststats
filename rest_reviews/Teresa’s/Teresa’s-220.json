The food was ok (not great, but mediocre) a bit lower than what we expected from its  3.5 star rating in Yelp . What resulted in the me giving 1 star rating was the way the waitress behaved when she brought the check. Our total check was about $46 which I paid by credit card. She came back already charged my card with an 20% tip. When I asked her why she added the tip on her own and not asking me first and the fact that we were only 3 people and it is customary to charge parties of 6 or more with %18 tip, she said \"lots of tourists come here and they don't know they \"must\" tip! So whenever the bill is over $50, we add the 20% on our own!\". This was the first time over the last 20 years I heard such a lame excuse. Our bill wasn't even $50 and wasn't the subject of her own made-up rule! She didn't even offer to take the tip off and leave it to me to tip whatever I want. She was rude and arrogant. I din't argue with her, but I won't definitely go there again!", "author": "Iraj S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-10", "description": "The food is bland on a good day.

That being said, don't come here looking for some culinary masterpieces, because that's not what you'll get.  What you'll eat is some great, simple, delicious brunch and polish fare.

We went for Chanukah after reading online reviews of latke recommendations. The latkes (potato pancakes) were different then any I'd had before. Smooth almost creamy on the inside and crispy crunchy golden brown on the outside. Also the apple sauce there is delicious! The perogies were very good, though go for the potato and mushroom and sauerkraut ones. The kielbasa was amazing and my husband said the sauerkraut was the best he'd ever had. Everything everyone had around us smelled delicious and the portions were large. It's a cute warm atmosphere near the lookout in Brooklyn Heights. We had a lovely evening for under $30 and were stuffed.", "author": "Amy B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-15", "description": "teresas is our faithful brunch and occasional dinner standby. \nmy children enjoy the pierogis, my mr. unlucky enjoys the blintzes \nand kasha. i love the white borscht. sadly i  tried to duplicate it much\nto my families chagrin. suffice it to say i will avoid that  type of pathetic\nblunder again. an added plus is that the coffee is ept and the service\nis ruthful.", "author": "bridget e."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-20", "description": "We walked the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn Heights, this is a must do while in NY.

When asking questions about the menu, we were met with eye rolls and huffs.  Finally, after being ignored the whole meal, we placed her tip on the table after paying for the check with exact change.  She misunderstood the scenario and confronted us with the lack of tip, only to be told it was on the table.

They serve reasonably priced, generous portions of food that tastes homemade but not too greasy -- a great substitute when you can't exactly get to your grandmother's house when you're craving her cooking.  Just think of it as adopting an Aunt Teresa that lives just down the street and always has something delicious cooking on the stove. :)  Everything the friendly staff has recommended has been great, but our all time two favorites are the Portobello mushroom salad (huge portions!) and beef goulash (try it with noodles and beets).", "author": "Alicia T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-07-11", "description": "I recently read an article about the actor Paul Giamatti that mentions that he eats here, so it must be cool, right? I always get the Polish food here, but they have an extensive menu with all the diner classics. Stuffed cabbages, pierogis, sauerkraut, and kielbasa are great. I also like the white borsht, a hearty soup with chopped kielbasa in it that bears no resemblance to red borsht.

The food is terrible! I mean really, really bad. Perhaps the Polish items are good but standard breakfast fare including eggs, potatoes and pancakes were truly awful. It might have been just bad if the service hadn't been, but was, equally awful. The waitstaff was rude and clustered in the corner gossiping.

AWESOME.  Not expensive (our grandparents do not overpay for food.)  Unfortunately the older clientele means the food can sometimes be bland, but the salads are delish (and seem to never end!) and so are the perogis.   Oh and they are open pretty late - 10pm?

We had the cheese... Beautiful thin pasta dumplings pocketing the perfect cheese surrounded by sweet onions. Potato pancakes too greasy but huge (3 in a half order).
