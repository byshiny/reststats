Always fresh and delicious. The agedashi tofu is crisp but not oily, Fashion Roll, Ki Roll, Foxy Lady Roll, are tasty, and the seaweed salad is yummy too. \n\nI would go there at least twice a week if I wasn't feeling so guilty about eating out/ordering delivery all the time.", "author": "Stacey P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-30", "description": "Food deserved 4* but service 2 - hence the 3 *.  We had reservations at 8 for a party of 8 on a Monday night.  We all arrived on time and when I went to the hostess she had that \"oh crap\" face on.  She said something like a large group came in and are waiting for them to finish.  She said 10 mins.  Okay- we waited the 10 mins and 15 mins later we were still not seated.  She said the table just got their bill and a few more mins..... so 20 mins later we are finally seated.\n\nThe food is good!  all the fish is fresh.  My group loved the ki roll and fried oyster.  Oh yes- the fried ice cream (green tea) was pretty darn tasty too.\n\nOk- back to the service.  Our waitress was all over the place.  We had to constantly ask for water and when they thought they brought all the food out- they didn't.  \n\nWould I go back? hmm... probably not with a big group.  maybe with 1-3 other ppl.", "author": "Hoi I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-20", "description": "The restaurant looks really nice, a nice classy and zen interior design help to set the mood. The staff was also caring.\n\nBut I have to say I was expecting more of the food after the reviews I have read on yelp. I have taken the lunch special with california and philadelphia rolls:\n- the miso soup was good\n- the ginger seasoned salad was really interesting, I think I would try to prepare the seasoning at home\n- but the rolls were just okay, I mean good, but definitly not the A-grade kind of rolls I was expecting. I think I probably prefer some rolls at the \"All you can eat' buffet at Ichi Umi.\n\nSo in my experience the restaurant was good, but I was disappointed to see the basic rolls were not better than the one you could find in buffet places.", "author": "Sammy B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-19", "description": "I was hoping for some real good Japanese food when I was reading all the good reviews right before I place the order.  This place was just about 10 - 12 mins walking distance away from my sister's apt, so I decided to pick the order.\n\nWhen I got back to the apt, all the food was well organized.  The salmon skin salad was on top and all the sushi and the sashimi was in a bigger box right below it.\n\nWhen I open the salad box, I could barely see any green.  There were too many Salmon skins on top.  The Uni/sea Urchin and the fatty blue fin tune was just ok.  The spicy tuna was kind of falling when I tried to pick it with the chopstick.  \n\nEveryone mention how good was the Ki roll.  The combination of all the fish was good, but I didn't really like it.  It was just a 3 starts for me.\n\nBtw, they gave me a lot of wasabi, but it wasn't spicy at all. I really prefer the good quality wasabi that you can buy in the Japanese supermarket.  For the money that I spent, I really think that I could find another better Japanese restaurant in Brooklyn.", "author": "Jay B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-02", "description": "Amazing sushi!!

They don't tell you the truth about the time it takes, and the time it takes gets you sushi that has been out of a cooler for more than 45 mins.   The sushi is good but not cheap.  So if you are concerned to eat sushi because it takes so long to get it after it is prepared, don't order from Ki.  I ordered this evening, it took over 1.25 hours and was told the delivery person had been out for over 45 mins.   And they don't have their delivery in cooler bags.

Yum!", "author": "Bella A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-27", "description": "Wow.  and again wow.  Perhaps one of the best sushi meals I have had in the US.  We had the supreme omakase.  The one disappointment was that the selection was not terribly exotic.  That said, the fish was very fresh and Ki was very generous in portions.  The slabs are probably 50% bigger than what you find in Manhattan.  \n\nThe must have is the TNT roll.  Tuna and truffle.  That is really all one needs to know.  It is a game changer.  The live scallop was also very fresh with 4 nice sized slices per order.  Both must haves.\n\nThe side dishes are what makes this place a stand out.  The garlic sauteed broccoli had incredible depth of flavor for such a simple dish.  Also, the spicy seafood soup is a nice warm addition to the meal.  The soup was a flavorful broth filled with plump prawms, mussels and fresh vegis.  It had lots of flavor without being heavy.  It leaves plenty of room to pack down more sushi.\n\nThe service was also top notch.  It is rare to have servers so attentive and pay so much attention to detail.  My napkin fell from my lap and before I even noticed, a waiter handed me a clean napkin and picked up my original one from the floor.  Also, I was wobbling the table a bit and before I could ask for any help, the hostess came by with two doorstops to stabilize the table.  I really didn't need to ask for much, they pretty much figured it out for me.  \n\nI can't wait to go back.", "author": "Scott C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-16", "description": "Ambiance is great.

It's not cheap, but considering the quality it's a good value.  I'm a huge fan of the Fashion Roll, the Fantastic Roll, the Volcano Roll, and even the humble Spicy Tuna Roll.  The ginger creme brulee is tasty too.  \n\nIn addition to the food, the folks here are super nice, especially Joe the sushi chef, who always says Hi to me, even when I'm just stopping in for take-out.\n\nOne quibble:  The music is really too loud, and also, pretty awful.

It comes in six pieces and actually came to our table pretty quickly. \n\nThe atmosphere is very nice, great for couples. We also ordered the ki roll, the volcano, and the foxy lady. The ki roll and the foxy lady was the best out of the three in my opinion. The volcano roll was decent. \n\nWe ended the meal by getting the ginger and lime creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was beautifully plated and was very good. I've posted up photos of the meal so you can get an idea of the food. \n\nOverall the food and the experience was great.
