If not, and you're in the Vinegar Hill/ DUMBO area for lunch, stop by here. It's got that kind of hole-in-the-wall vibe too. You're offered a selection of meats, rice and beans, as well as some sandwich options. I found their menu hard to grasp, and some things I heard ordered weren't even listed. \n\nI ordered a custom sandwich - pork and plantains. The plantains were good, but I wasn't given very many. The pork is cut from what appears to be a whole, cooked pig. So the parts were chopped for my sandwich. I was left wanting a cut of pork a bit more refined when I was chewing through impossibly tough and hard skin. It was all a bit underwhelming.", "author": "Ian M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-23", "description": "Food is delicious, comes in very generous portions, and is cheap (6 bucks total for beef stew with rice, beans, and veggies) which for me as an intern in the city is huge. But while the food may not look gourmet, it is absolutely delicious. Everything from the pork to the chicken, to even the rice tasted fantastic and was filling.\n\nGreat place to eat for lunch, and really nice people who work there. Clearly deserves a 5 star in my book.", "author": "Andrew G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-01", "description": "Great spot for pernil. Very tasty.

First time it ordered the pepper beef and that actually was delicious with the rice and beans they have. Unfortunately I'm not very impressed with the fish filet. It seems like just a small piece of fish with tons of breading and deep fried. It was hard to cut through even with a knife. This gives me the impression that the quality of this restaurant isn't fantastic, I can be wrong.", "author": "Alexander Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-01-03", "description": "I like the atmosphere of this place. It's a hole in the wall place that feels homey and staff is friendly. There is no similar joint with this type of food anywhere nearby so I really wanted to like it. However, in my opinion, the food was only ok. There are other neighborhoods in the city where there are lots of restaurants similar to this one and serving better food. However, I will also say that I came with a friend and she loved the place. I am planning to come back to try it again. One good thing is that the price is fair. For $9, you get a big plate of food containing plantain, rice, and meat. I wouldn't call that cheap, but definitely fair, especially for this expensive area. The most disappointing thing for me was the plantain. I  love well cooked plantain. Badly cooked once, however, are a big disappointment and that was the case here. I thought they had a slightly off flavor and were not well cooked. Once again, I note that my friend disagreed and thought there were great. The rice and meat (her pepper steak and my oxtails) were both good but nothing special. A nice touch was some fresh cilantro and some hot sauce that got put on your plate. If you are craving Latin food and you can't go far, you should definitely come here. But I would say that if you want this kind of food specifically, you should go to a different neighborhood and explore other food options when you're here.", "author": "Aliz C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-13", "description": "Lots of good food; $7 for a heaping plate. \n\nI ordered the yucca, black beans, and roast pork today, and am suffering from a delightful food coma 20 minutes later.", "author": "Mickey M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-20", "description": "This place is CRAZY delicious.

Thank God for that! Amid all the new ChiChi restaurants in the area here is a good Dominican Style Diner. I had Beef Stew with Peas and Rice and fried Plantains. Great great food ample portions (even on the plantains) and the price OMG. When I was being rung up he said \"$16 Papi\" I explained i was paying for both of us he said \"Yeah I know\".
