While walking there, we stumbled upon this restaurant.  We took a look at the menu and decided to go for it.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is very cute and cozy in that French way.  My friend had the eggs florentine and I had the eggs benedict.  Our poached eggs came out perfectly (they were runny inside).  Eggs florentine are usually made with spinach, but Cafe Paulette made theirs with kale.  Our dishes also came with a side of greens and french fries.  The french fries had skin on them and were crispy and yummy.  I wanted more.  \n\nI only have two gripes about this place:1) They only allow larger groups to sit at the booths.  Otherwise, you have to sit at the tables.  2) The other thing to note is that this restaurant crams all the tables together.  There's hardly any space to maneuver around.  It felt like we were on top of the couple next to us.  Having said that, the food is good and I'd come back if I lived in neighborhood.", "author": "N L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-27", "description": "Had the lunch special, small tomato and ginger soup with bread drops..

We were sorely mistaken.\n\nThe Place: It was 90 degrees out and with windows open, flies and knats were roaming \nfreely. We came not expecting Michelin star joint but that's not how we wanted to start our Sunday brunch.\n\nThe Food: The burger with roasted potatoes and pain perdu we ordered looked NOTHING like the photos. The pain perdu were 4 pieces of thinly sliced, soggy, underdone brioche French toast. Someone should explain to the chef that Pain Perdu is typically made with stale baguette, NOT brioche. The burger was average and does not warrant a $16 price tag... Btw we never got the roasted potatoes we specially requested. \n\nThe Verdict: We came to this place hoping to find a hidden gem but left feeling deceived by the photos seen on Yelp.

Used to be a casual hole in the wall on DeKalb and has moved next door into a beauty corner location.  Not fine dining but more of a French comfort food concept.

That's over 2 minutes an oyster. Unfortunate because we were planning on ordering more oysters (just starting slow to not overwhelm the kitchen) but by the time we got the first dozen I was ready to call it quits.\nOverall: the oysters were good but the owner needs to work on the staff, especially service.", "author": "G S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-27", "description": "I've been here a few times and always found the place to be a bit overpriced but the food to be good. However tonight, my friend and I were told from our server that we were being to loud: Mind you he didn't come up to us and ask if we could lower our volume (which would have been annoying but I ultimately would have understood) but yelled loudly himself from behind the bar - and across the restaurant- \"Guys! Be quiet\" \n\nWe felt like we were being chastised by a teacher or something.  We speedily relocated to another restaurant and kept making fun of each other saying \"guys! Be quiet\" so it'll get a lot of play in further outings I'm sure.

I would have given the place one star.\n\nHowever, I'm giving it four. I returned only because a friend whose tastes I trust highly told me to go back and give them another try. I'm glad I did.\n\nWhy it was awful the first time I don't exactly remember, but I do know the server was a bit rude and unattentive (I haven't seen her since so maybe she was fired) and the food seemed lackluster on that day.\n\nBut ever since I've been going back, I am reminded that it must have been an off-day. This place is otherwise fantastic-- super charming and cozy. The french owners / staff are really funny and warm and friendly. And the food is quite good, and they have a small but solid and affordable well-curated wine list.\n\nDefinitely a very authentic French vibe; it's obvious as I often hear French speakers hanging out there having a glass of wine, so it seems to be the hot spot for French people and Francophiles like myself. ;) The atmosphere is something special-- the kind of place you'll see friends greeting each other over a glass of wine and smiling and then a little ember will ignite in your heart reminding you that it's good to be alive. Ya know?\n\nOne last thing: the burger is amazing! I can't call it the best in NYC only because it's a different experience: it definitely has a French spin on it that makes it unique and different from all the rest. But it's really. damn. good. And trust me, I am a burger connoisseur. (And to my dearest vegetarians: they have some fantastic veggie dishes as well!)\n\nAnd come on, patio seating right across from Fort Greene park?

I live right up the street and it's adorable, but those reviewers who talk about the terrible service are right - it's bad.  \n\nMy friend and I went for brunch, and even though there were only 2 other tables occupied, we were sat in a corner where we could barely move.  We ordered drinks and food at the same time, but were served both after people who came in after us, which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  It didn't make matters better that I was probably 4 feet from the bar/waiter while he continued to ignore our attempts to get his attention... \n\nShit really hit the fan when he took my friend's food away **before she was done eating.**  He then offered to give it back after piling all of her silverware and napkins on top of the plate/food, at which point I went from being shocked to just truly amused.\n\nAlso, I looked over the reviews again after having been to Cafe Paulette, and I find the owner's (\"Lionel\") responses really funny.  Even when voluntarily responding to displeased customers on Yelp, Cafe Paulette implies a defensive, self-righteous for no reason, pretentious attitude that is a perfect reflection of what it's like to interact with their staff in person.  Like why is it necessary to cite to the standard size wine pour when responding to a YELP REVIEW?  Calm down and just say you're sorry (or maybe just not say anything).\n\nLionel - I would suggest checking yourself before wrecking yourself, and try admitting fault once in a while before too many potential customers catch on.
