The most recent name was \"Since 1963\" but thanks to some 1 star Yelp reviews, the new owners revamped the place.  \n\nFound this place late night looking for a quick Cappucino fix.  The sidewalk tables felt real cozy.  Their cappuccino machine was't running yet :-( however the molten lava cake wasched away my woes.  Their coffee mugs are definitely the most unique I can ever remember seeing.  Hope to go back when they're up and running to give em a better rating!!", "author": "Samuel C."}], "servesCuisine": "Food", "priceRange": null, "name": "Bueno Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "102 Smith St\nBoerum Hill", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": null, "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185968118"}
