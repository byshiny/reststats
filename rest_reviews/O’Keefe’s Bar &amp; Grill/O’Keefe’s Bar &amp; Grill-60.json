I've been here before and it's your pretty typical wannabe Irish bar. As it was Monday night they had a decent $4 pint special as well as $.50 wings. The wings were pretty good, especially for $.50 each. They were cooked well and a decent size, sometimes places with inexpensive wing specials give you these tiny baby wings. I'd probably go back for cheap wings again if I was in the area but otherwise there's nothing really special about this place.", "author": "Matthew R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-29", "description": "Great bar, friendly people -- fans can get into it when NFL season kicks in and the bar is showing all the Sunday games, but that's part of the fun!

We came in at 2 pm. It was empty, with about 5 patrons peppered across the bar and 3 people at tables. We received no acknowledgement upon entering the bar or sitting at the bar. We sat down for 10 minutes and no one said a word to us. There were TWO bartenders behind the bar and nothing was said to us at any point while we were sitting there. One girl looked at me and made a face and turned back to continue a conversation she was having with a man in a suit about school and the the other girl literally had her back to the bar chatting with one of her coworkers the ENTIRE time we were there. We didn't even receive a hello a greeting, a glass of water. I couldn't help but feel discriminated against as my mother and I are black women, and I am covered in tattoos. I think the way they treat people in there is disgusting. Downtown Brooklyn has ALL walks of life. I work as a bartender and have been one for 6 years so I know the bare minimum and these people  didn't even acknowledge our presence. Will never come back and I suggest you stay away too.", "author": "Hadassah A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-29", "description": "I loved the chicken wings over here.

The only thing this place has going for it is location - if you're a tourist or if you're welcoming your touristy friends to the neighborhood this place has a lot of thing within walking distance that are great.\n\nI supposed if you're a sports fan this place might not be so bad either but there are better places in and around this quaint part of the borough to get your sports on. And you'll never know if you're gonna see your game since the staff have no idea what's on their TVs.\n\nCustomer service was ok as far as courtesy goes but I felt as if the bartenders were way too stressed out for having a less than full bar at the time. Not to mention they aren't good a taking an assessment of the entire bar to see who's next on the list for a drink. I waited for ever while people jumped in the bar line after I was already waiting and got waited on.\n\nIf this bar wants to get on the radar and take advantage of all the good things they have going, location, size, TVs, get better bartenders, better menu and advertise your games (my friends wanted to watch off the wall Rugby which I know comes on cable if you have a major sports package) - maybe also sell the place to the tourists with all the cool things they can do around the neighborhood so us locals with visitors in town don't have to do all the work (kidding not kidding).", "author": "Madeline Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-27", "description": "It doesn't look like much from the outside, but O'Keefe's delivers as a neighborhood hangout/sports bar.

The food and drinks are fairly priced and I love the atmosphere.  One of my favorite things about this place is their jukebox.

My honey ordered the Calamari, which she says she could've done without (this is her usual hang out spot, mind you). \n\nI know it's an \"Irish Pub\" so I shouldn't expect to be catered to but.....I like to be wiggle in my chair a lil or get up and hit a 2 step with a drink in my hand ya know? B.B. King ( as much as I love him) \u0026 other Blues artists are HARDLY my idea of a good time when I'm trying to \"TURN UP\" on a Friday night.

The service and ambience weren't terrible, the misleading advertisement on pricing and the rude ass manager were though. We came in because of the advertised $4 shots, only to be hit with completely different pricing. When we told the waitress about the bill she got the manager who came over and didn't apologize nor show remorse but rather yelled at us and said we \"should have asked\" about the special, told us never to come back, and called us stupid for not understanding the advertisement. Well maybe if you would've specified it asshole, we wouldn't have been mislead.
