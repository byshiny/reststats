I had a brunch item and we also got the medium guac. The chips and guac were slammin' and as always it's cute when they make it in front of you. I was there on a gloomy Sunday afternoon and it was surprisingly empty. I also got the bottomless mimosas. They always came within 5 minutes of us finishing our drinks (usually less) and we had well over 10 (don't judge the glasses are tiny! haha), they were pretty weak but for the price and frequency I had no complaints. Would go back and would recommend.", "author": "Len N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-02", "description": "Rocco's is a good place for drinks and that's it. Oh and maybe some guac, which is prepared table side and delish. \nThe food is pretty terrible and I also kept having the most awkward interactions with our waiter (Richard) to the point that he stopped coming to our table and left us waiting for a long time. He was so adamant about me not getting enchiladas with just cheese and insisted that I get the veggie ones instead or a burrito - huh? \nNeedless to say the enchiladas stuffed with random veggies were not good and he was upset that I didn't want to take them home.

This one was less exciting/hopping. The food was okay, nothing spectacular. They only offered one GF dessert option and they were out of it so my friend had to miss out.

It was our first time here and the entire staff was sweet and attentive. As much as I wanted to love this place, the actual food was O-K. I'm really picky about Mexican food because my mom's food has forever spoiled me (thanks, mom). That being said...there's really nothing great about the food. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great. It's more tex-mex than it is a Mexican restaurant. I will say that the chips and guac is worth the price $$. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but I also would give it another shot. \n\nTIP- if you check in, you get a free tequila shot.", "author": "Jessica S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-25", "description": "The food was good 8/10. Our server was in training, but very sweet. The young lady that was training her was just as sweet. My friend and i were patient and very understanding bc we know that others may not be. Only issue was we were seated right next to the check in desk and the employees who are really just young \"kids\" were a tad bit unprofessional... especially while people are eating. Joke around on your own time. Patrons do pay attention.

We were a group people with varied dietary restrictions and this place easily accommodated all of us. They made us fresh guacamole and pico salsa with chips right next to the table and it was finished within minutes. The food tasted great and our waiter (who was on his second day of work, Joe) took great care of us. I had the California Fish Tacos and my wife had the corn on the cob with a shrimp taco. There were no leftovers from any of us 6. The best part that if you check in then you get a free tequila shot with the purchase of an entree, so of course we had to celebrate the end of our exams.", "author": "Jeremy T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-27", "description": "I visited on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't too busy. However this location is fairly new \u0026 its layout is very expansive.\n\nWe were greeted and seated right away. \n\nWe order the table side guacamole which as perfect. The only restaurant I've visited and they finally had ripe avocado's. I take this pretty serious lol because I LOVE avocado's. They added just the right amount of ingredients.\n\nWe ordered drinks which were also made very well. I had the house margarita I believe. It was strong too but not too strong where I couldn't enjoy it. \n\nWe ordered the wet burrito and the enchiladas. I was already beginning to get full from the guacamole. But the food was perfect. For a Mexican theme restaurant they have this under control. Hands down best Tex mex restaurant. I've visited Mexico and I've had pretty epic authentic Mexican food. They didn't over do it. \n\nThe ambiance also plays very well into the theme. It is 2 floors. The restrooms are equipped with screens, different. A lot of festive Mexican decorations.\n\n\nI would recommend this place for a night out, girls night, or a laid back birthday dinner, it's also good for a date for just 2!", "author": "Shardae W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-17", "description": "Had a fabulous lunch there! Loved that they make the guacamole to your liking. Service was friendly and courteous really nice vibe.

It has taken months upon months for me to review this place. First off, a fantastic check-in offer: free shot of tequila! Woo! Yes, let's get the party started. I was here with my in-laws on a dinner out after my sister-in-law's wedding. The rest of our party downloaded Yelp for the check-in offer! The place was next to our swanky hotel, so I had been seeing it for days on end, and it had been calling my name. Finally I arrived with the family. Partly because of the check-in offer and the rest because of the company, my experience was pretty great. A shot of tequila and a beer are a combo that doesn't miss often. I opted for several specialty tacos for my meal. Overall a good experience, but my three stars are due to what I discovered upon exiting our booth, in the corner space that butted up behind us. Someone had been sick, and I'll leave it at that. Maybe too many check-in offers redeemed?? A complete let down after an overall fun and special experience. Like I mentioned I'm confident my unfortunate experience was a one time thing. A bummer nonetheless!", "author": "Harlan M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "Amazing! I took my boyfriend there last week for his birthday.
