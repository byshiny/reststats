I must admit, I have been living nearby for almost 2 years and never felf like I should go.\nWell... I had a very good dinner for $14 each including appetizer + entr\u00e9e. More than enough food!\nI stayed classic and ordered a chicken masala. Very good!!

Besides serving sub par Indian food, they tried to charge me higher prices for takeaway than the menu published on their official website.  When I pointed out the lower prices they advertise on their website, one staff member first claimed that it isn't their website at all, and another then asked me not to order over the phone again.\n\nRest assured, I won't.", "author": "Raj J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-17", "description": "Best Indian food in Brooklyn Heights.

I receive the order and I give him money and ask him for change so I can give him a tip. He then proceeds to suggest how much I SHOULD give him because it was a big order (which I can assure its not) before giving me the change back. This is seriously disrespectful and unprofessional.\n\nI feel I will not be doing business with this place again.\n\nUPDATE: I am very sorry. I gave this place another chance as the manager seemed sincere in apology after my first bad encounter but this time I felt was even worse. I ordered lunch before 12:30 from here. I was notified that it was to reach me between 1:05- 1:15. I didn't receive the food until AFTER 1:30. I called the number only for it to not be ringing. I called customer care who also had an ordeal trying to reach the restaurant with the number provided.  This is bad. I try very hard to not be like customers that are rude and feel self entitled but this time I am sorry to say this was unacceptable. To make it even more awkward upon receiving the food the delivery person made 2 excuses under one breath of why he was late. A) it was really busy and B) It is really cold outside. However there are several places on both Remsen and Montague that deliver to my office on a daily basis for seven years and they have delivered despite cold. I will not tell anyone to eat here because when all said and done they need to see for themselves. However (though in my mind I honestly feel the establishment does not care) I feel that after 2 times of being burned I don't think I will go for a third time or any other time in the future.", "author": "Bowser F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-25", "description": "I'm visiting from Detroit and staying at the Marriot Brooklyn Bridge,  this is very close within walking distance.

My usual combo is the tandoori chicken with a non veg curry which is always consistently good.\n\n I usually go with chicken tikka masala for the curry which is boneless pieces of chicken in a heavenly tomato cream gravy. I don't like dark meat in chicken much and this seems to be one of the few Indian places which uses chicken breast pieces in curries. The tandoori chicken too is tender, juicy and incredibly tasty,with a choice of boneless or bone-in pieces served with sauteed onions and peppers.\n\nThe naan served with lunch is soft and fluffy and the perfect vehicle to sop up the curry.The curry is also served with rice which I almost always have to skip because its a lot of food!\n\nI really like this place for its consistency and also because it doesn't seem to skimp on portions at all!", "author": "Aparna K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-24", "description": "Listen. Listen. LISTEN. this place. This darned place. I've ordered from them throughout my three years at Brooklyn Law, and they never disappoint. I'm writing this review about five minutes after I just devoured the three entree lunch box, which I had with chicken tikka, chicken vindaloo and goat curry. I've had a lot of Indian food, and I always appreciate a fantastic lamb or goat dish whether it's curry or biryani, and Curry Heights has one of the best goat curries I have ever had. Perfectly tender, succulent and flavored, even if the idea of a gamey meat makes you uneasy, their goat curry will change your mind and palette quickly. \n\nThe chicken is always great, but their variety of curry is impressive. \n\nI also opted for an order of the lamb samosas, which was a mistake only because I had a food overload. But the lamb was delicious. A bit salty and oily, but it's a lamb samosa--that's to be expected. \n\nMy only critique, if you can call it that, is that they don't leave the bay leaves whole, so if you aren't careful, you'll get a piece of leaf in a bite of food, which as we all know, is not pleasant. \n\nOtherwise, I love this restaurant. Oh and also, the delivery guys really really are gentlemen.", "author": "Hooney H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-17", "description": "Very good value for the money.
