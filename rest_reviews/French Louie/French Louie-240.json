Started with the oysters and gougeres. They were superb! I highly recommend the trout- perfectly cooked!

Wrong decision to go to this place for dinner. The worst squash soup I have ever had, tasteless and too thick with raw prices of carrot! pan fried trout: two thin layers of tasteless fish, no sauce, some pieces of Apple! The dessert, chocolate mousse?? Horrible. Grainy texture no taste of chocolate. I bet the chef has never tried their own food. Oh, and the wine, cheap wine for $14 per glass. Is his a joke? Absolute rip off.", "author": "Maryam M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-24", "description": "There are so many great restaurants to choose from in Brooklyn that as a rule I try very hard not to go to the same place twice. I will 100% be breaking my rule for French Louie. So happy this little gem is only a few blocks from my apartment. \n\nThe restaurant is a bistro-type atmosphere: tea lights on table, bustling wait staff, closely packed tables and cute bar area in the front. While it can get pretty loud (there were times when it was difficult to hear my three table mates), I'd still call the place warm and inviting. \n\nMy meal started with the roasted carrot and citrus salad - light and  delicious. Next up  the pan-fried skate over dirty rice - another dish I would order again in a heartbeat. My tablemates were equally satisfied by their Bavette steaks and the handful of apps we ordered including the fried anchovies, pickles and radishes. \n\nThe wine list is relatively affordable (you can get a decent bottle for around $42 bucks). \n\nCan't wait for FL to start serving brunch (I imagine there will be Buttermilk Channel like waits), but will definitely be visiting for dinner again soon.", "author": "Mandy G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-15", "description": "Slow and impersonal service. Apparently medium well here equals burned.  Glad the wait was short because I would be angry if I had a long wait for such crappy food and bad service. Save your money and try someplace else. Two stars just because the wait was short otherwise it would be one.", "author": "Lisa F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-02", "description": "Not only is the food here amazing, but so is the service. Had my first experience here on a Friday night- it was packed. We were seated rather quickly for how busy it was and the hostess was so friendly and accommodating to my dinner date who is rather picky and not the best restaurant guest. We had the frenchie salad, the sardines, the pappardelle, the beef bourguignon, and my dinner date had the steak. All fo which were AMAZING. not to mention the plethora of cocktails that were executed perfectly. Don't be dumb. Eat here.", "author": "Kristen P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-19", "description": "This place is absolutely delightful. My husband and I came here for our anniversary and the food and service was impeccable from start to finish. The scallop ceviche was light and refreshing. The gnocchi was insanely good and my husband got the 28-day steak which was delicious. We finished it off with the pineapple tart which my husband didn't want to share after he tasted how delicious it was. By the end of the meal we were deciding all of our friends who we wanted to bring here.

The waitress kept apologizing about the wait but we only really waited 10min so it wasn't so bad (but I did make reservations). They were so nice and attentative the whole time. The fried anchovies were amazing so you must try this! We had their cocktails which were also very good. I had the bavette steak (delicious) and my husband had the pork and clams which was also a good and hearty dish. For dessert we had their homemade pistachio ice cream and pineapple tartin with coconut ice cream.

They are a great brunch spot, and a great dinner spot. The best of French food that we love, but also just things that can be hard to come by, like soft scrambled eggs.\n\nThe staff is knowledgeable and good. The food is excellent. They do so many things well it's hard to name them off. Oysters are solid, lobster (in the summer) is solid. Champagne excellent. \n\nGood place to do it up in Brooklyn.", "author": "Petra A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-24", "description": "Excellent scallop starter but the bluefish was not cooked enough.

Two stars for the food, with a bump-up for the friendly service.\n\nWe started with Anchovy Frites -- i.e., fried anchovies, not fries with anchovies.  Interesting, but I won't order again.  The gougeres were puffy but boring, with barely a cheese flavor.  Bavette steak was tasty, but pricey at $25 given the small portion.  Cocktails were nice.\n\nLast word is on the decor: ugly, ugly, ugly.  Really detracts from the dining experience.  Cheap flatware, too.  Oh well.\n\nNot worth a trip, but fine if you happen to be on Atlantic Ave.  But only meh.", "author": "John D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-12", "description": "Review for dinner on a Saturday night.
