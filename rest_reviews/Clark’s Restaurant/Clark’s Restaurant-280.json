Sure it's only a few blocks from my apartment, but it's affordably priced, nice decor, and the food actually tastes GOOD, a trait that some diners these days seems to be lacking... Especially in their breakfast options... What's up with that! I go to Clark's with the Boy almost every weekend now and the manager (owner?) always greets us with a warm smile and hello and immediately gets us a table. We're damn good customers. \n\nI've had a melange of breakfast things to eat at Clark's (pancakes, salads, sausages, waffles, etc) but for healthy reasons I often get their garden omelette with egg whites, little Swiss cheese and whole wheat toast. I don't know how they do it but with a Clark's omelette, the vegetables are never hard or mushy, the eggs are perfectly moist and the potatoes are delectably crunchy on top without being burnt. Perfection! \n\nSeriously Clark's, I don't know what I would do without you for my weekend brunches. None of the other diners in the area are good enough. You make me smile! :)", "author": "Leslie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "description": "A nice neighborhood cafe to grab a quick lunch. My husband and I shared one of their lunch specials, The Grecian, grilled chicken wrap,tomato, romaine, red onion, cucumber and a yummy Greek sauce. The specials come with choice of soup, the bean soup was tasty, good to the last drop. The specials include a choice of drinks, can of Coke and dessert, which we skipped we were so full from the wrap and soup. Bathrooms were small but clean, friendly service.", "author": "Joanch M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-22", "description": "This is a quintessential diner with a huge menu, fast and friendly service. Stick to the classics and you'll be happy. There's often a line out the door on weekends but it moves fast and the owner is super friendly and welcoming. It's been in Brooklyn Heights forever and I hope that never changes.

I've only had their breakfast (read: omelette, french toast, etc) items, but it seems like their lunch/dinner foods are also good, as I've seen many other patrons ordering those types of entrees.  The service is generally fast and polite, too, so no complaints.", "author": "Michelle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "Coldest breakfast I've ever had, from the service to the blasting AC to the rock hard bacon \u0026 cold eggs \u0026 toast.

I have breakfast here at least once a week. I highly recommend the eggs avocado (similar to eggs benedict but with avocado), the banana chocolate chip pancakes, and egg sandwiches. The staff is amazing and friendly. I get a warm welcome every time I stop in. The prompt delivery service is a major plus.\n\nThe only downside is that they close at 9pm on weeknights, which makes it difficult to get in for dinner. It can also get very crowded on the weekends, and there is not much space to wait for a table. However the staff is great about turning tables around quickly.", "author": "Emily A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-30", "description": "We stayed in Brooklyn for a couple days at a hotel and needed some decent food for us and the kids. We wanted fast service, good selection, and good prices. This place hit all three for us. It was 5PM so it wasnt too busy and we were seated right away.

This place has what I consider to be the best omelet in the area (the italian omelet- made with mozzarella, sausage, and onions). Every time I order it it's perfectly cooked and accompanied by some of the best home fries I've ever eaten. That said, whenever I venture away from that to oder something else, I leave sorely disappointed. Their pancakes are underdone, their sandwiches so-so, and their eggs (on their own) leave something to be desired. \nService is all right; staff is attentive if a bit overwhelmed. Atmosphere is pretty typical for an American/Greek diner.\nI'll probably keep going here but I think I'll stick to their omelet. It seems to be what they do best.", "author": "christopher b."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-05", "description": "The service at Clark's is fantastic. Our server was incredibly attentive, nice, and hilarious (he brought us small glasses of fresh orange juice and smiled at us and said, \"...not Tequila\"). I ordered typical brunch fare, a spinach omelet with toast, and I was not disappointed. The toast is much better quality than your typical diner toast, too. Clark's has a very nice, homey vibe that my friends and I absolutely loved. I will definitely be returning here!", "author": "Emily H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-17", "description": "Oh Clarks how I miss you!  We used to live nearby and this was our neighborhood brunch place.  My husband is an early riser; I am not.  He liked to sit at the counter and have breakfast and read his paper.  Later he would bring out baby daughter.  When we went together, the manager would remember us and our daughter.  I would order French Toast (as good as Sarabeths or EJs in Manhattan but way cheaper) and fresh squeezed OJ and a cup of Green Mountain coffee.  My husband would get one of their excellent omelets and toast.  It was simple food, nothing fancy, but prepared really well.  And when we wanted to really indulge we got their patty melt, which was heart attack-inducing awesomeness.  It is no longer on the official menu but you can ask for it off menu.  The prices are crazy reasonable for a really nice, neighborhood place where they remember you and the food is good.  Really a rarity.  We moved away over four years ago but recently went back, and the same manager remembered us.  Just lovely.", "author": "E M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-11", "description": "love this place\n\nreasonable prices, spectacular decor French bistro style\n\nget the meatloaf and baked potato, so good and filling!", "author": "Jomei L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-04-20", "description": "DON'T TRY ORDERING TAKE OUT DURING NORMAL DINING HOURS.\n\ni tried to order take out on a friday night - huge mistake.  simple order - two sandwiches - however person taking the order needed to put me on hold and cut me off to call me back before i can finish ordering and pay.  i never received a call back.\n\nyou're better off using a different diner in the area for take out like park plaza, who actually takes seamless web orders, unlike this place.", "author": "Charlie K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-22", "description": "this is a great place to have around. it's just good, consistent diner food. the staff is always great. the breakfast is on point. soup, sandwiches, burgers, salads, real food, they have everything and they make it all just good enough to come back.\n\nthe prices are probably slightly higher than your average diner, but I'm guessing rents in the heights probably have something to do with that, and it's still cheap compared to your typical brunch/dinner options.", "author": "Jake D."}], "servesCuisine": "Diners", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Clark\u2019s Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "80 Clark St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_1T55JW7JQ-s8XZ_tOtNfg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188555484"}
