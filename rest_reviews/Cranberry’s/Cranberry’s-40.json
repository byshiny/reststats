So we took the train and started walking around Brooklyn Heights, when we stumbled upon this little spot. I must say that the sandwhiches were very tasty and certainly something different. We also could not help but get some cookies for our ride back home. They were so crunchy and tasty! It is very small but they have a small counter where you can stand and eat your food. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was very cozy. Next time we visit, I will definitely be returning to this little gem.", "author": "Michelle P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "description": "Cranberry's falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars... I find myself going here more out of convenience than craving their food and coffee. \n\nThe prices are better than other neighborhood shops, the coffee is okay, and the servers are very nice. They also do coffee punch cards. Breakfast pastries are hit or miss, but you get what you pay for. \n\nBe aware that there's no indoor seating, just a bench outside.

The croissant was dry, the eggs plain, and the bacon was flat, precooked, and missing some smoke flavor. It was edible. \n\nSo next time I went, I asked them to add butter, salt and pepper to the sandwich. I could see flecks of pepper on the eggs but didn't taste any salt. Where's the salt? Is there a salt embargo? Even the cheese tasted like it had no salt. How can you make cheddar cheese without salt? I think they even used unsalted butter.\n\nIt really had potential, but no amount of doctoring can make one of these as good as a deli sandwich. If you have to eat here, BYO salt shaker.", "author": "Jarrett S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "Note this review is only for the coffee and occasional muffin or cheese Danish: Don't be scared by the \"B\" rating. Because If you are looking for a great cup of COFFEE that's consistently good. This is the place! I wouldn't get a sandwich they sit, longingly pressed against a plexiglass prison. Albeit,\nUn-refrigerated they look tasty enough (most likely the reason for the Big \"B\"). I just haven't had the guts ( pun intended) to risk the outcome of \"summertime mayonnaise blues. \nStick with the coffee and you won't care if they had a \"D\". Or it was served from a open cauldron of coffee goodness. \n\nIf you like Cheese Danishes I would high recommend theirs.

So soft and delicious--the icing isn't super hard either.\n\nSeriously worth trying--a great spin to the traditional cookie. So good, I just can't.

My friend and I did a little yelp search, found this place to be agreeable and headed on over. \n\nStaff was very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the Rooster and preferred there be no sprouts on my sandwich and they gladly subbed in lettuce. The sandwich was lightly grilled/warmed before being served.  I wish they had asked me if I wanted any dressing on it or anything. As a pre-made sandwich I thought they would have a suggested sauce, but instead I asked for mustard when I realized it would be plain.\n\nMy friend ordered a sandwich on a sub which was enormous and looked great!\nPrice range $7-$10\n\npitfalls: There's only one tiny table in the back, BUT you can cross the street and sit in the par if you so choose.", "author": "Ari A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-09", "description": "When I lived in the area, I would swing by here every weekend.

The bagel was mediocre, and the cream cheese did not taste great, and was just slathered on. I guess it was because of the morning rush, they were rushing orders and packing them so they can get on to the next order. If I came when it was less busy, they probably would've made it right.

Sometimes iced coffee can be harsh, bitter, astringent, but theirs is great (go here instead of Vineapple). The flavors are good too, I love the hazelnut iced coffee.\nThe bacon egg and cheese is ok....overpriced and not enough bacon.\nThe people who work here are friendly and I like that it's open early in the morning.

I come in here every week, sometimes a couple of times a week for my coffee, and when I want to have a big breakfast I'll get a bagel with egg and cheese. SO. EFFING. GOOD. It's cash only, but it's cheap. There's a cash machine in the back if you forget to bring cash, but everything is so inexpensive here you don't need much. The only things that suck sometimes are the cookies, but WTF are you going here for cookies?! BAGELS. COFFEE. GET OUT. Get with the program people!
