Loved coming here and getting her treatment.  She was great.  Boy, I remember coming here after clubbing and stuffing myself with waffles!  (Im not a big cheesecake eater, but I can eat the crust of a cheesecake like there was no tomorrow.)  I'm a vegan now so it would be hard to eat there--lest I was dropping my law for a day!  I miss Brooklyn and can't imagine what its like now with the new Barclay Center a few blocks away.  Junior's is the perfect place to be gluttonous and avoid counting calories.  A good place to forget about cholesterol and fat and just pig out.  So, beware when you go, and have a plan!!!!!  And workout the next day for shizzle!!!!", "author": "Ganious M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-18", "description": "Can't say their legendary strawberry cheesecake was any different from the Cheesecake Factorys", "author": "Girl B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-25", "description": "To me, Junior's is not just a mere Brooklyn eatery landmark... to me, Junior's is this special place that holds sentimental value to my entire family.  It is this very famous cheesecake mecca, where my mother and my father had their very first date... flash forward almost 45 years later, and Junior's was a must-do on my to-do list with my wife.\n\nYou may look at Junior's passing by on Flatbush, as you say to yourself, \"Why would anyone ever want to walk into that overly brightly lit diner in the middle of such a crappy area?\"... well, you would be foolish not to pique your curiosities and step inside for a quick bite.\n\nAs you peruse through the menu, the only echoing thought that will run through your mind is, \"I can get this diner slop anywhere,\" and for what it's worth, there really isn't anything on the menu that screams New York's Best... that is, right up until you decide to order yourself a slice of cheesecake... or should I really say a thick indulgent slice of heaven.\n\nSuddenly, as that creamy rich goodness meets your tongue, you will understand why this is Brooklyn's best.  That's when that slightly above average brisket becomes something to go out of your way for, just so you have an excuse to eat dessert.\n\nIt's hard to explain.  You look at the cheesecake, and it looks like every other cheesecake you've seen.  Then you ask someone to describe it, and usually the word \"heavy\" is the first thing that people say.  Neither which feels even remotely worthy of being the best.  Which is why, in this case, tasting is believing.\n\nI can still remember arguing with my wife, as I tried to force her to eat a slice of Junior's cheesecake, where her words of \"How good can this cheesecake really be?\" became trumped by the decadence that won her heart over even before the first bite was fully swallowed.  Yes my friends, the cheesecake here is just that good.  So good, that the moment my wife was done with the first slice, we were buying one whole cheesecake to take home for us to enjoy later, one for her sister to eat with her boyfriend, and one for her parents to enjoy... just the same way my parents did 45 years ago.\n\nNow that Junior's has become slightly commercial, in that they have a few extra New York locations and even an online ordering system for their famous desserts, you still need to do yourself a favor and take a hike into my hometown to try the original... it's really the only way to do it right.", "author": "Bryan L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-12", "description": "Likes:\n-Huge Portions\n-All American diner atmosphere\n-items on menu you don't usually find nowadays, but used to be very popular (potato pancakes)\n-Potato pancakes\n\nDislike:\n-Junior's club was huge but no good.

It was not bad, better than Cheesecake factory perhaps, but no where near the best cheesecake I've had, and I would not even rank it higher than Marie Callendar's cheesecake (which I like a lot even though it is a chain).\n-Most of their food was whatevers, like sweet potato fries (edible but not memorable).

I was so upset. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager and they were helpful enough and comp'd the whole meal, so we didn't pay. \n\nAll in all, without the rogue meat pieces, the food was still terrible.

The restaurant itself is pretty big; it has 2 levels, with clean bathrooms on the upper level. They have a counter in the front for take-out and cheesecake orders. Junior's is good if you know what to expect. \n\nThe times that I've eaten there, I've had to wait at least 5-10 minutes to be seated, even when the restaurant is not crowded. The servers are not particularly friendly, but, again, I know to expect this. \n\nI've ordered a little bit of everything off their menu. I've had griddle cakes, burgers, potato pancakes, steak burgers, and a bunch of other entrees I can't remember. Their food is usually greasy, but if you know to expect this, you won't be disappointed. Their beer-battered onion rings are greasy, but wonderfully disgusting.\n\nNow, the cheesecake is hit or miss. I have had their cheesecake on many occasions, tried a bunch of different flavors, and it is inconsistent. On some occasions, it's been creamy and wonderful, and on other occasions, it's been less than desirable. (Plus, who can forget the photo of the impostor rat in the window of Junior's, amidst said cheesecakes?) The memory of how wonderful the cheesecake is on some occasions keeps me coming back.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for a meal. It is convenient in respect to location and their food is really decent.", "author": "Stefanie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-01", "description": "My Dearest Darling:\n\nI will forever belong to you.

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise! I prefer the classic plain, but the strawberry is delish, too. \nI have a few other menu favorites that are standards: The breakfast basket, brimming with fresh-baked assorted rolls and mini danish; home made corned beef HASH; pastrami on twin onion rolls...YUM. The last may be just a tad fatty, but, hey, It's pastrami. \nBut by far, what I like most about Junior's is the family that owns it. Over the last few years, as written up in the local media, developers offered $ millions to take over the property...and the Rosens (who I have never met) didn't sell out. Brooklynites sure do appreciate that dedication to our borough and rich tradition, as well!\nPS.

Junior's is ehhh OK I guess ( I really mean ehhhhh). It certainly doesn't deserve rave reviews. I have certainly had better cheesecake from a regular ol' supermarket. I would NEVER EVER go back to Brooklyn for some of this sub par cheesecake concoction created in a rumored rat infested kitchen. Their red velvet cheesecake was below my standards- tastes like cold sweetened butter. Why Puff Daddy (or whatever he goes by now) sent the poor souls of Making the Band to get him some cheesecake is beyond me.

I don't even like cheesecake.  But my friend, Heather, visiting from California adores any kind of cake pretty much.  She ordered the original cake and was QUITE delighted by her choice.\n\nOur server, Sam, was AS delightful as Heather's slice of cheesecake .  Even at 12:30am, he was chipper as can be.  And we all know how hard that has to be working at Junior's.\n\nI wasn't even all that hungry, but I definitely indulged in the free pickles and beets.  Gotta love diners/delis and their pickles.  And then like an angel from heaven, Sam delivered a plate full of cornbread (that came with the chicken strips my other friend, Vonnie ordered???).  And although I despise anything in the cake family, I don't discriminate against cornbread.  \n\nDuring our late night feast, we were even serenaded with the familiar tune of \"Happy Birthday to You\" going on at the table across the way.  This party of grown folks decided it would be awesome to celebrate this person's birth at 12:30am at Junior's.
