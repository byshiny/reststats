Especially to a French girl like me, definitely telling my friends to avoid such overpriced low quality in the future. It's one thing to charm people  with cool marketing, it's another to meet the quality it should be associated with. I will give you the fact you have your staff wear quality original \"mariniere\"...that detail isn't unnoticed by me!\n\nBut I gave you one last chance here, my conclusion is that I will stop giving them from now on.\n\nI know good addresses for chocolate croissants people, skip Maison Kayser and hit me up for the real deal here in NYC.

I had the tuna croissant with avocado and tomato and the white chocolate and pecan viennoise. Both were delicious. The croissant was soft and the sandwich was not messy. The viennoise was not too sweet and was sprinkled with sugar. I bought the mini one and wished I had gotten the large one.

They have great, strong coffee too. Great variety of unique pastries. Only thing is they are a bit pricey but they are still worth it since you cannot get these in a Starbucks or your local pastry store. Staff was attentive and nice. They also have sandwiches, soups and other foods, not just pastries and baked goods.

The soup was edible and flavorless. The best part if the soup for me was  the guyrere cheese that was nicely melted on top. The broth which is supposed to be beef had no flavor. It lacked salt and color. I am very disappointed that they could not get this right. \n\nAs for my service I was forced to sit at a waited table and not at the other tables they have if you buy a cookie or pre made sandwich. For one person to just order soup it was very upsetting to me. As I am waiting for the check the waiter disappeared into the back of the restaurant for a 5-7 minutes. \n\nThe friendliest and most helpful person I encountered was the African American male barista. \n\nI guess I will stick to my cookies, croissants and premade sandwiches at this establishment .", "author": "Desrin M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-11", "description": "Croque monsieur was delicious, and pastries are quite good. Not a bad choice to grab breakfast and/or a morning drink on the go.  But table service was poor.  Later we simply wanted to get some afternoon tea.  The place was more empty than full.  After we were seated, we waited 10-15 minutes with no attention or visit at all from the waiter.  He was there, and saw us, but simply focused on other stuff.

They should never look like this. I've often bought these at the discretion of the employee who is picking it for me and this is what I'm left with. This is honestly horrendous and I've never had a location so often burn French pastries to the point that they are hard. Of course I only discover this when I am home or in class. \nThis is unacceptable for a French pastry shop.

I have been coming the past few Sundays and the same employee has been helping me and she has been rude to me every single time, but yesterday she was cursing as if she were working on the street; and she told me the manager was \"too busy at the moment\" which is why I did not bother looking for the manager. \n\nI was holding a cup of chia seed pudding and when I came up to the register she charged me for what I thought was my pudding, but after I paid she handed me a bag. I told her no this is not for me (it was a croissant and it was for the man behind me) \n\nShe then looked at me with confusion and anger, I told her it was a mistake and it's ok...she then went on to charge me for the pudding BUT I just paid for the croissant??!!! I told her no I am not paying for this I just paid for that croissant. \n\nAnyways she kept talking to herself and then she said that she's having a bad morning and she is \"fucking everything up\" she did not apologize to me, she was just rude the entire time. And I was standing there not knowing what to do, I asked her to call the manager but she looked over to the left where the restaurant side was and said \"my manager is busy\" I gave her the difference which was like .75 cents between the croissant and the pudding. But even after SHE IS THE ONE WHO MADE THE MISTAKE, I just got huffing and puffing and rudeness the entire 10 minutes that I was standing there. \n\nEvery Sunday I come in and if I ask a question about a pastry she gets mad or gives me a very unpleasant attitude. \n\nShe is a young black woman with very short hair. She also has a little bit of an accent but not sure what kind of accent. \n\nI have been going to many Maison Kayser locations for years, Its always been a pleasant experience except for Court Street. It saddens me that I will not be going to this location anymore; the location that is in my very own neighborhood.", "author": "Gabey K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-29", "description": "My anytime food spot always good !

Prices are typical of NYC, perhaps rather higher since this is a chain from France. I ate there when I was in Paris, and I'd say the food was pretty similar. Tried a sandwich to go and also a full breakfast. \n\nThe pastries are just as tasty as they were in Paris. However, I will remind you that this is equivalent to a fast food/cafe restaurant in Paris and it looks a little more high class in NYC with in door seating. In Paris, they considered this quick cheap eats. So, with that in mind I would say the food here is comparable to a quick, cheap market restaurant in Paris. I would say the food is up a notch from a Whole Foods Market or something to that aspect.

There's a couple places that I would goto instead of this place.  The thing that annoys me is how dirty it is in front of the restaurant.  The smell linger right in the front.

You probably don't need me to tell you this because you're not an idiot, but:\n\nPeople, this is not Paris Baguette.\n\nThis is a gorgeous bakery with stunning croissant, baguettes, and anything else you'd want from an oven. Additionally, it's a damn good spot for a fancy-ish lunch in the fast-casual wasteland that is Downtown Brooklyn. This is what that sad, disappointing chain Le Pain Quotidien probably was once upon a time, and now what they wish they could be.\n\nIf you have time for lunch, and aren't just swinging by for carby deliciousness, do not sleep on the dope tartines. \n\nIf you're a fatty like me, rock the Champignons \u0026 Oignons option. I'm biased because I love all 'ignons, but the onion soubise with the gruyere...it's richer than anything you should be eating, but it tastes so good once it hits your lips.\n\nIf you just like good, seasonal food, they have a lovely autumnal chevre tartine on the menu right now. With squash, dates, pecans, pumpkin seeds, brussels sprouts and a bit of honey, it's perfectly balanced and it would take you too much time and money to assemble all those delicious things at home. I'd eat it every day. \n\nAnd if you don't want to reward yourself with delicious pastry and hearty tartines, you can just masochistically watch them bake behind the glass.\n____________\n\n*Not because she's a woman (I marched this past weekend), but because she's my wife.", "author": "Peter D."}], "servesCuisine": "Breakfast \u0026 Brunch", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Maison Kayser", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "57 Court St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oNv83FtiCxojncpZ_Z_4Kg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17182549600"}
