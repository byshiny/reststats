I think its an improvement for both venues size and ambiance wise. My boyfriend and I had drinks here a few weeks ago and were pretty impressed with them. My boyfriend got the Lady Jane and I got the Ides of March (both seasonal cocktails) and they were very strong but very tasty. The bartenders are friendly and they offered us a shot of a new cocktail they were working on. We didn't have any of the small bites but if its anything like it was at Bevacco's bar, their cheese plate is amazing. We will be back for more drinks and snacks in the near future. The only thing that I felt was lacking (as a wine lover) was a variety of wines by the glass but they are trying to be a mainly cocktail bar so I understand.", "author": "Jessica S."}], "servesCuisine": "Tapas/Small Plates", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "The Binc", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "60 Henry St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/8pPiSk-aNrcIGDYz2NqDkg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17186241444"}
