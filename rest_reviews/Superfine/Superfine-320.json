We tasted each others and hands down, blah.  Not worth the wait, but  the bartenders were cool, gave us a round of shots. \n\nI really can't remember what the dishes my friends ordered, that tells you something...   They were totally generic, closer to mass produced chain restuarant food.    We did tell the waiter and he gave us dessert on the house (nice), but those too seemed like they came from a box. \n\nExpected more from such limited menu.  Oh, and the schpeel about being organic and fresh, blah blah blah...hmmm - questionable.  \n\nI would not go out of my way to go back.

I've been to Superfine about 5 times, all at varying points (Sat night dinner, weeknight dinner, Sunday brunch) and each time the service has been fine and the food has been delicious.  Fun cocktail list.  It's moderately priced for Dumbo.  I get that the decor and atmosphere can be off-putting to some, but you should be able to recognize that that is an individual preference thing and Superfine is going for a certain aesthetic.\n\nShould be more like $$$, esp if you get a few drinks.", "author": "Daniela J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-19", "description": "great interior, but a small ever-changing menu with very few veggie options and no snacky small plates.

The food is tasty and unpretentious. My girlfriend had the steak and fries, I had pork chops and mash potatoes with asparagus. They had a good wine menu and the pricing was reasonable.The atmosphere is kinda shabby, but in a calculated (not intentional) way, and our waitress was a delight.\nThe only disappointment came with the dessert. I got the brownie with whip cream (they made it sound much more appealing on the menu) and my friend had the ginger cake with lemon sorbet. We both strenuously wished that we had quit while we were ahead. But the food was so good we didn't think that we could lose with dessert. Oh well.

Gorgeous tall ceilings, warmly lit, and (to sy's delight) comfy couches. And I love that it's called Superfine, but is in a place called Dumbo. Next time I'm in Brooklyn, I'm just gonna stay there.

For dinner we shared the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which was grilled well. I had the roast half-chicken (tasty dark meat, dry breast meat) with a yummy side of mascarpone mac-n-cheese. My friends had the barramundi and pork chop. Overall the food was good. I enjoyed my meal. But for such basic dishes, the food was overpriced.\n\nI really liked the interior of Superfine. There's a bar when you first enter and an elevated area in the back used for dining. The decor is eclectic-- random diner-style furniture, various colored lights, exposed brick walls. It's fun and low key but nice.\n\nI'd eat here again if I find myself in Dumbo.", "author": "Alicia L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-06", "description": "Just a little too mediocre for a place that presents itself as being much better.", "author": "Kerry S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-11", "description": "Honestly Superfine can do no wrong to me,  except now the client\u00e8le is beginning to annoy me...

Location is also good, located right on Front street around all of the other (read: not many) neighborhood places to join in some sort of merriment.  Don't get me wrong, I like dumbo, but it's hardly a real \"destination\" with robust nightlife offerings.  Superfine fills the niche well, as a bar doubling as a lounge with live DJ sets. \nThe beer is standard fare and at least one tap is generally dedicated to a local brew. \nIt's an interesting strategy to name your establishment as two superlatives.  Sets the bar a bit high.  And, while I quite like superfine, I'm not quite sure it lives up to its nomenclature.

Nothing better than meeting up with a huge group of friends the morning after, so to speak, ordering a bloody Mary, and stuffing your face.

It's built in a large, open space with a brick interior, which I'm guessing was a factory in its former life.\n\nThe lighting is soft with lots of colorful paper lanterns. There is a pool table toward the front and the bar is very cozy. The kitchen is open, which is always nice:)\n\nMy one issue was with the menu selection. The waitress brougth over a white board with around 5 entrees and 5 appetizers on it. That would be (super)fine (sorry, couldn't resist) if there were more variety in what was offered. I was there on Thanksgiving Eve and didn't want a very heavy dish, but all of the options save one mahi mahi entree and an appetizer salad were heavy.\n\nI ordered penne with broccoli, panchetta, gorgonzola and brussel sprouts(it was the lightest option that wasn't seafood). The portion was managable, which made me happy as I tend to devour all that's placed in front of me! It tasted great, but was a little heavy on the salt and olive oil. \n\nSuperfine has a very interesting dessert menu. We ordered an ice cream dessert that was pretty complicated. The waitress kind of lost us halfway through the paragraph long description, but it was very, very good. Two scoops of a homemade, citrusy ice cream on top of a double espresso shot topped with a tiny puff of very light whipped cream and some cinnamon.  \n\nOn a side note, I love the random sparkly touches:silver foil stars hanging from part of the ceiling, red glittery flame designs on the bottom of the doors and a curtain of long red tinsel and beads serving as the door to the women's restroom. I may or may not have walked into the restroom just to pass through that curtain....;)\n\nI liked this place and I would come back. But I'd eat healthy all day before visiting and not stop by on the night before Thanksgiving!", "author": "S V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-08", "description": "I would say it was fine, but not super fine.  Drinks \u0026 vibe are good here, but I wasn't impressed with my underwhelming pasta.  Weirdly the menu is on a board, only there wasn't a good place to view it from where we were sitting so they passed it to us.  I guess it saves trees.  The cheese plate was pretty good, though. I agree that the layout of the place  is strange.  We sat on the high side of the bar, near the kitchen and also along the path from the dining room to the restroom, so it wasn't exactly cozy, but on the plus side, it was easy to flag down the bartender when we were above him.", "author": "Briana H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-06", "description": "It'ssssssssssssssss alright, I guess!  But don't dare order a Guinness here. I've never in my life seen such a badly poured Guinness--was it the bartender's first night? I mean, we're talking it looked like she had poured a Coca Cola! She was nice enough when my boyfriend politely asked for something in the bottle instead. My wine was drinkable.
