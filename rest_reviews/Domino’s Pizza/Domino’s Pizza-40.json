This is a disgrace. I will be contacting Dominos corporate. NEVER AGAIN. Ok so an hour after she told me he left still no pie. I call to find out he BROUGHT IT BACK!!Saying he was told it was wrong and to bring it back. He never showed up here!

They're undeserving of even that!  I ordered a pizza via the app and then phones the store to tell them I didn't want the garlic on the crust (my family has never been a fan of that) and I was on hold for 3 minutes before they picked up the phone and hung it right back up!  I called back hoping it was a mistake, and sat on hold for 7 minutes.  I finally decided to walk into the store while still on hold, since I live on the block, to tell them I don't want the garlic crust.  I walk in and see 3 people standing around while the phones are going crazy.  A upbeat girl asked if she can help me and I immediately ask her why they don't answer the phone.

Yeah there is better pizza out there specially in NYC but it is expensive to buy even a plain large pie in Brooklyn. I buy pizza a lot so spending $7.99 + tax and etc on a take out deal is a good deal but you do get what you paid for which is typical corporate pizza. Pizza itself is decent but quality wise doesn't hold a candle to the pizza places in the neighborhood like Pronto Pizza which is only a few blocks away but costs more. I have been ordering pizzas as a carry out since they have a coupon for a large pie for $7.99 Monday through Thursday and since I'm on my way home from school on the train I just order it while I am on my way home and pick it up. I have also ordered delivery from there for as long as I remember and found it pretty good delivery service.

Anyway I'll probably order something for the super bowl, and am preparing in advance for what always promises to be a nightmare.  I have never ordered from this particular Dominos that something hasn't gone wrong (Usually time Wise.)  It's taken them over 3hrs to get me my food, and they're about 5 blocks away.  On that occasion I refused to tip, and the charming young gentleman handling my food told me to go F--- myself.  On top of that Dominos is meant to be cheap isn't it? At least I remember (a thousand years ago) it used to be thirty minutes or free. But somehow the cost of ordering from them always comes to more than much better food quality/service places in the area.  How this particular branch has stayed in business flies in the face of the most basic  economic/customer service principles...it's a real head-scratcher.  The five dollar delivery charge which is not a tip mind you, is also a pain.  So really the question is do you feel like Dominos?  If so you don't really have another choice, but  you will be waiting for your food...I think a lot of people feel less and less like Dominos these days.", "author": "Flem B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-24", "description": "We usually order Domino's a lot... But this place is Horrendous!!!! After waiting for 1 hour for the pizza (I was really hungry!) I call the guy to ask where it is.. He's like the driver called this number 3 times. He mentioned the number he saw on his caller id. I said that's not possible since the number I wrote on the order is not this number. \nWe he realized I caught him lying, he put me on hold for 5 minutes then hung up the phone on me. I tried calling him again several times but he wouldn't answer because he saw my number on his caller id.\nHe finally answered after I used another number to call him. and gave me another lame excuse. The driver only had to buzz the door.. he didn't need to call any number!!!!\nThe customer service guy was extremely rude, lying, and unprofessional.

The temperature of the pizza indicates that this was definitely on the driver. But wait! There's more. The driver then tells me he didn't bring my credit card slip to sign, is that okay, and where's my tip? My response was \"well I can't give you tip without the slip! Not to mention this took forever to arrive, and there was a delivery charge added on when I ordered.\" I then called the store back (my 3rd time calling I believe) and told them to leave a reduced tip from what I normally leave for delivery *and* that I'd be watching my accounts to make sure that they don't attempt to upgrade the tip since the driver \"forgot\" the credit card slip for me to sign...\n\nAt least it was the right size/type pizza, and they believed me on the account-monitoring because they didn't try anything.

This is the least consistent, most erratic service I've ever experienced from a pizza place.  The last time I ordered from them, I never even got my pizza, and I was five blocks away. (I couldn't leave my place to pick it up because of illness.)  After 1 1/2 of waiting, I called and was told there were only two delivery people working that night, but that my pizza was on the way.  It never came.  When I called back, they simply stopped answering the phone.\n\nPreviously times were pretty bad too, but sometimes I just wanted a Domino's Pizza and was able to look past it.  I have now been cured of that particular desire.\n\nThere are a few really great reasons to not order Domino's in New York City.  If you live in the area of this store, I would urge you to look into other pizza places.\n\nEDIT: July 2015 Service has greatly improved per some friends of mine, so I did order again from them. Much better service so I will bump up the star rating, which hopes that they will not slide back into the poor service from before.", "author": "G Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-21", "description": "Fast service.
