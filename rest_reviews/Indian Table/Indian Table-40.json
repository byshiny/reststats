Paneer Stir Fry had maybe 6 cubes of paneer in it. \n-menu still has some kinks to be worked out - only two vegetarian appetisers on offer, not really any salads/soups, etc.\n\nI could see a fully stocked bar but they didn't have a liquor licence yet - seems they are working on it. Also no drinks (other than water or mango lassi) and no desserts yet. \n\nIt would be great if they could provide some pickle or raita to go with the food. \n\nStill too early to tell, but I am hopeful about this place.", "author": "Alisha B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-25", "description": "Amazing food. \nFlavors on point\nClean and relaxing/fine ambience\nCourteous staff and service. \nDefinitely recommend the dal \u0026 rice, Fish curry and awesome mango lassi. \nA 10/10 experience! \nWill post pictures on my second visit.

We ordered Lamb Vindaloo (very spicy), Salmon Tikka, Chana Saag and garlic naan.  Everything was well prepared - especially salmon was excellent. It was presented nicely and cooked perfect.  I rarely eat Indian food but I would definitely come back for another meal soon.

My girlfriend and I love food. Indian food is always a win. This place has AMAZING authenticate Indian food. The Chana Masala is the best I've ever eaten.

They gave our apitizer to the table next to us...they took it after a few minutes..rearranged it and served it to us. The second apitizer they brought was wrong so they took it back and never brought the correct one. \nThe meal I got was tasty but cold! My friends meal was ok.

Its a full sensory experience - the warm smells, the complex flavors that hit perfectly on so many levels, the beautiful colors of the food - I must say \"mmmm\" 25 times every time I have their food and I just can't get enough of it all. My fianc\u00e9, who has traveled to India for work multiple times, says this food is on par with, if not better, than dishes she had in high end places throughout the country.

This place surprised me with how the flavors in everything I tried were so well balanced and often subtle.  We were both very hungry which I'm sure made it better.  Even so this is not just the neighborhood Indian place, they clearly aspire to be much better.  Kevin, the owner, waited on us and after twisting his arm heavily guided our menu choices.  Even the rice pudding which he admitted was nothing fancy had just the right sweetness and was perfect.  I was told they only use fresh ingredients, not frozen or canned.  The food tastes as if a great deal of care is taken to make it unusually good.  My wife and I both feel it's the best Indian we've ever had.  Just get advice from the staff first since I was told they only reluctantly prepare the more pedestrian items (ie. chicken Tikka).", "author": "Joshua Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-23", "description": "Don't know what it is about indian food below street level, but really enjoyed the Table!!

I've walked by this place a ton of times, but never stopped in. I was craving Indian one night and I remembered that they delivered. Their menu is not on yelp, which was not convenient but I called and asked for a lamb entree which I paid $18 for. I thought it was a little steep for Indian. The portion was huge and it came with a large amount of rice and two vegetable samosas and a plethora of dipping sauces. I love sauces!! It was delicious and made 3 meals. Not too shabby. I would order from here again and now that I know how good it is I can't wait to dine in!! :)", "author": "Maria R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-22", "description": "This place has really excellent food.

However, portion is not big so my friends and I were still hungry afterwards. The thing I didn't like was that the waiter was trying to up sell us- kept asking us if we wanted wine all night long. You also have to pay for rice (In our experience you get rice along with your entree). Also, naan order is only One piece so you'll have to order a few.

I honestly think the waiter stuff think they are too good for the job/the customer and was also very condescending. \n\nPRO: \nthe food is amazing!!! The only way I'm ever coming back is if I get take out.\n\nCON: \n-The service is terrible. Really terrible. They should change staff.\n-My friend asked for yogurt to offset her dish, our waiter felt the need to tell her it's her fault that she wanted a spicy dish, even though she wasn't even complaining.\n-We asked for wine recommendations. He pointed out every wine on the list.\n-Came over to cut me and my friend off while we were having a intense conversation several times.\n-When we asked for 2 different nun bread to start, our waiter told us that that's not an appetizer. We went on to order an actual appetizer and 2 mains after but that's what we wanted while we were deciding. \n-When I asked for my dish to be packed up, they put the bone in a bag. Like I'm a dog or something without the rice or any of the curry that came with my dish. \n-When we asked for the check, the waiter had time to stand around with his back to us, talk to his fellow wait staff, go outside and just stand for 5 minutes before giving us the check.", "author": "Lulin D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "The Indian food here is as good as it gets.

The theme is very small portions awash in great quantities of sauce. We had the konkoni fish and the whole baby eggplant in sesame peanut sauce. They both came in bowls that consisted mostly of sauce. \n\nThe food tastes good, significantly better than your basic paint-by-numbers Indian place in the neighborhood. The sauces are flavorful and you can taste the quality of the spices and the other raw ingredients. \n\nBut you have to consider that an entree costs a couple bucks more than you'd normally pay for the same dish in this neighborhood and the portions are about a quarter the size. \n\nTwo entrees, which came with rice, plus an order of naan, wasn't quite enough food for two light-eating adults.", "author": "Lindsay B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "My favorite Indian place in Brooklyn!
