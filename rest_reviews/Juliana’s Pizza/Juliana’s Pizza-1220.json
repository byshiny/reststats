We started in line at the ever touristy Grimaldi's Pizza.\nSome felt generic about the experience so we b-lined next door to Juilana's. Apparently the creator of Grimaldi's created this place after he sold Grimaldi's...it's named after his mom.\n\nWe got a margarita pizza with pepperoni's and man on man it was f'ing delicious. Now I didn't get the opportunity to compare the top 3 rated pizza joints in the city, but one you've tasted perfection, it seems foolish to venture downward. Tastes like heaven...super fresh, coal fired brick oven heaven.

Amazing pizza. Thin crust. Wow. A must to try", "author": "Liz M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-10", "description": "Consistently topping lists for best pizza in Brooklyn, Juliana's is the original Grimaldi's, though the long lines outside the latter show that many still don't know this, and prefer the gruff manner of the staff at the corner joint. The original site is a much classier affair, with cleaner lines, white walls and professional service, as well as a charming manager and regular visits from the proud owner himself. The choice 'No.1' in the pizza specials is a thing of fresh, salty decadence: Mozzarella, Scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions and Oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil--no tomato appears on this white pie in any form, and frankly is not missed at all. There are also pastas, salads and desserts, and an extensive choice of wine and beer, so it's easy to get carried away here. The only thing you might find is how noisy the space can get, due to some strange acoustics or lack of soft wall fittings - it's a cacophony at the worst of times. But who really cares in such a rightfully celebrated institution?\n(delusionaryculinary)", "author": "Paras G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-27", "description": "Originally I had reservations for a restaurant in Williamsburg, but since we were in Dumbo, my boyfriend and I took to Yelp to find a place closer. We cam across Juliana's, which was apparently founded/owned by the original Grimaldi. It's actually right next to Grimaldi's as well. The line sizes for both places were comparable, but we were eager to try Juliana's. Waited about half an hour, but that was fine, as I was catching Pokemon. Once we were seated, we decided to split a large Margherita with prosciutto and pepperoni. The combination of the meats plus the cheese and the thin crust made the pizza absolutely delicious. I don't remember Grimaldi's, but the pizza at Juliana's was top notch. The large was also a bit much for us, as we had a few slices left over.. which was no problem to eat the next day. If I'm ever in Dumbo again, I would definitely go back.", "author": "Linda L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-09", "description": "So I had sky high hopes from Julianas, all the fame that comes with Mr Grimaldi and all that jazz...so were they fulfilled? \n\nWe ordered the Arugula salad with goat cheese \u0026 walnuts and it was absolutely delightful on a humid summer day. Crispy, light and the goat cheese was divine. \n\nThe star of the meal was the classic Margherita pizza. I mean you really can't go wrong with a Grimaldi Margherita pizza! The pizza was good, very fresh and had all the right flavors, but to be honest, I would have prefered a crispier crust. It was just getting to the right degree of crispness when it was served to us. \n\nOf the two, the salad came out a clear winner. Umm, not such a big deal, but then we were under the legendary roof of pizza connoisseur Mr Grimaldi. \n\nMeanwhile, the service was excellent, there was no line, the restaurant had a nice buzz, and yes Mr Grimaldi was manning the floor himself. \n\nI'm going with 3.5 stars for this outing.", "author": "Arshi K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-01", "description": "Aside from zagat calling this the best pizza in NYC.. it is.

NYC is filled with fantastic well-known and not-so-well-known pizzerias. But I can honestly say that Juliana's takes the gold medal for the best and most memorable slice I've ever tasted. Specifically, I'm referring to their Pizza Special No. 1--an incredibly nuanced, addictive, and ridiculously tasty combination of mozzarella, scamorza affumicata, pancetta* (italian bacon), scallions and Oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil - no tomato. I often find myself fantasizing about this very slice and reliving that amazing first bite. For this special alone, I'd vote Juliana's over it's next-door neighbor, Grimaldi's (which is also delicious but not as memorable).

The other 5 stars are for the service. \n\nWe went here with my cousin and her family on the rainiest night in NYC. My cousin drove over from Long Island and couldn't find parking after a couple of rounds. So they decided to drop off the wife and baby with us at the restaurant. Patsy, who we had been talking to for a few moments, said to just park the car in front of the restaurant in this little driveway area and that he would watch the car. What?! I'd like to think he did this because we had a little baby in the car, but honestly he was so kind and warm I'm sure he'd give this level of service no matter what. Love him. \n\nPizza. Let's just say this is way better than Grimaldi's which has turned into a total tourist sh*t show. \n\nLOVE YOU PATSY!", "author": "Bhumika K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-12", "description": "Why isn't this place 6 stars?

The crowd wasn't great because we had a 45 minute wait and a busy server, but the food was very good. The staff was nice, and the menu had many options.
