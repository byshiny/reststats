It was my first time visiting but definitely not my last. I loved the decor a bit of a rustic feel on the inside. There's a bar area with stools you can sit and grab a glass of wine and chill. \n\nThere's also two main rooms where they sit people with one of the rooms a bit tucked away to the side seemed more intimate to me.\n\nMy friend and I started off with an appetizer with different cheeses, grapes and slices of bread with jam. The sweet and salt taste was so amazing and the different type of cheese was a good starter. \n\nFor our pizza we had the Quattro Gusti (four selections) so we both had the opportunity to sample four different styles of pizza! Definitely didn't disappoint with their oven style!\n\nThe atmosphere is very relaxed even though they were packed and they had customers waiting we didn't feel rushed to leave.", "author": "Alicia B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-13", "description": "Wow wow wow I'm so impressed. My SO and I came here for a Monday night date night - we typically never pick Italian because of the lack of vegan options. We decided to look at the menu any way because it is a long time neighborhood favorite and we love pizza. While I was just expecting a red pie with veggie toppings, Dellaroccos recently added a small vegan menu that has VEGAN CHEESE and carefully selected toppings. It would be an understatement to say I was excited \n\nWe ordered the grilled veggie appetizer that was so much more than slices of veggies, they made a beautiful presentation of eggplant, peppers, and zucchini. The flavor was unbelievable ! \n\n\nI had the Lei pizza which was a burst of flavor in every bite. I was beyond impressed with the flavor - it wasn't just an every day \"oh here are your toppings on dough\" they were tastefully pulled together. Definitely returning!", "author": "Christina H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-03-29", "description": "I don't know what's going on here with this crust, maybe I am just not sophisticated enough to understand this pizza. I was on my way to Carroll Gardens when it started to rain, so I decided to look for \"best Bklyn pizza nearby\". This came up, and the pies looked promising, but...Listen I know everything is not L\u0026B, most of the pies in NYC are thin Neapolitan, but I just don't expect to fold my slice and pick it up and it flops down like I'm trying to hold melted cheese in my hand. I guess that's the reason for the knife and fork, but the paper thin slice didn't even seem done all the way through. I am not eating a crepe, I expect a little architecture to the crust, something to give it a base. Am I wrong here?\n\nAnd if we're being all sophisto and white napkin in this place, then shouldn't you be able to explain the food to me a little bit? Isn't that the characteristic of new foodie Bklyn restaurants, that they tell you every little thing about the food you're eating, both on the menu and in person? The sausage was so good, but the staff had no clue. You know, what kind, where's it from, is it local, made in house, is there someplace I can buy it, what! Pepperoni, same. Cannoli, same. Is it from a bakery around here, hello? They just seemed to be phoning it in, waiter-wise. And btw, the cannoli? Meh, too much sweet ratio, if I wanted to eat an entire bag of powdered sugar I would do so.\n\nI would say that I really don't care about waitstaff, the focus is the food, and the crust is not up to the standard of classic pizza in my humble view. I think maybe it was cooked wrong, the outer crust was perfect, chewy, little burnt spots, smoky taste, the cheese great and fresh, the porcini mushrooms, so good, the other slices of kale and sausage, how creative and a great mix, but...crust, the rebar of the pie, if you will, the inner part has got to be firm enough to at least carry a basil leaf without collapsing. But what do I know. Anyway, yeah, Carroll Gardens next time.", "author": "Michele D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-20", "description": "It's hard to find a restaurant that has as many white pizza options as red ones, but this place does -- and more. We had their very generous salad caprese with soft mozzarella and tomatoes that exuded summer and white pizza taleggio with caramelized onions and fennel sausage. The wood oven made the perfect thin and smokey crust.

A little too bready though. \n\nOur $30 pizza was disappointing:(  \n\nDough was chewy and without substance. The pizza couldn't take the little toppings and cheese it came with\n- ordered extra toppings.  Maybe they added them, I couldn't tell.\nI am sure the ingredients are primo, are they worth $5 each for a small personal 12 inch? NOPE\n\n$45 total\n\nWe pass this place many times and think its a cute, family oriented restaurant.

I loved the Eggplant it was very tasty. After going to Italy 2 times a year for 7 years I'm picky about the way the sauce taste. Call me crazy but once you have pasta or any Italian food in Italy .these Italian restaurants in NY have a picky one on their hands... LOL. But this place gets it very close....\nWith my Eggplant plant dish I had a glass of Montepulciano which was at the right temperature to taste.. \n\nMontepulciano, one of Italy's most popular red wine grapes, has thrived in Abruzzo- region of east-central Italy, since the middle of the 18th century. A plump grape, which gives good yields of easy-drinking wine, it is popular with producers and consumers alike. The variety typically provides deeply colored juice ,which varies from ruby to purple depending on vintage and the particular winemaking techniques used, with low acidity and soft, unobtrusive tannins.\n\nYUMMMMY!!!", "author": "Irene B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-02", "description": "True Neapolitan pizza.

Dellarocco's is kind of expensive, though, and the toppings tend to be too wet for the thin crust, which gets floppy as a result.

I really enjoyed the capricciosa but it really needs more basil. I've noticed this at many pizza spots around nyc, the basil is utterly conservative, like 1-2 leaves for the entire pie! It seems to be a nyc phenomenon - very light basil application. But i love the fluffy but chewy crust, and I personally don't mind that the center of the pizza is not firm. This is very standard for wood-fired pizza and so it's what I'm used to! \nI also ordered the kale salad and I loved the dressing. Thank you for not doing an overly garlicky flavor and heavily creamy texture. The dressing was even a little runny but I like that, otherwise it just lumps. But please (this is going to sound so basic) - massage your kale, or \"marinate\" it in very light olive oil. Eating completely raw kale, in very large pieces, is not great. I'm not sure if this is what diners like, but my experience with kale salads is that the greens are tenderized before serving.\nI will add that I ordered through Caviar, perhaps if I dined in the salad would have been prepared differently? I'm not sure, but the pizza still was great after being delivered. And I will say the delivery time was before the promised time so I was happy about that!", "author": "Emily R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-13", "description": "Great spot, even if it's off of Montague st....\n\nAs is the case for many of the Brooklyn Heights Montague st. eateries, quality food and value are usually lacking.
