I didn't mind the wait, and the pizza wasn't bad, but the service was. The waiter wasn't interested in us, maybe even annoyed at us for some reason. Perhaps because I asked him to explain the menu, which he didn't. They don't have a liquor license so we couldn't have a beer. This also wasn't explained so we ordered coke and lemonade which arrived in bottles with some warm glasses filled with ice. So we drink straight from the bottle. \nThe pizza was nice but not great. Many other places will have similar or better pizza than this restaurant. \nService with a smile would be nice to (or even if they looked at you)", "author": "Shaun V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-08", "description": "This one's a historic place. I always get a pie here every time I walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. There is almost always a line here. The host was very friendly, seated us as soon as he had a table available. It is an \"all guy\" run establishment, waiters are no nonsense and efficient.

It's always there regardless of the time \u0026 location. I grew up eating loads of pies, so a variations in flavor and style starts to dilute 20 years down the line...  \n\nin short, great pizza, fast service, long ass wait. 4 star worthy. \n\nfor all you @ work, trying to kill time...\n\nGrimaldi's offers an authentic italian feel, no not the jersey shore fist pump feel, but the loud, talks with the hands, and a bit pushy type of the italian. SERVICE here was quick, you tell them what you want and they deliver, no muss to fuss. Pizza's take about 30 minutes to prepare, but drinks quick and aplenty. \n\nPIZZA, they have a variety of pies, we opt to custom ours with 4 toppings which cost about.. 15-18 dollars. The ingredients were fresh, loads of cheese, and the tomato sauce was very tasty. In short, it was pretty damn good.\n\nthe WAIT is pretty ridiculous, a lady who walked by the line suggested going to the restaurant down the block. She said it was just as good with no wait. I would have dashed there if i hadn't invested 20 minutes of my life already. Luckily, we got pulled from the line and was seated right away. :)\n\nin all, 4 star worth, a must try.", "author": "Alex C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-03", "description": "Came at 2pm on a Monday and waited 50 minutes for a table.  I've never waited 50 minutes for a table.  The first thing you notice is the amount of rules you're subject to when eating here: no slices, no credit cards, no baby carriages (wait... what?), a system for assigning tables that makes no sense to anyone but the maitre d.\n\nWe sat down and ordered our drinks and pizzas.  We decided on one white and one regular.  Since it was nearly 3pm and none of us had eaten that day, we were ready for a massive pizza binge, taste be damned.  The pizzas arrived looking like a good New York pizza should: thin crust, grease pooling on the top.\n\nMy overall opinion is that it's over hyped.  It's good, but it's not as good as its own reputation.  The white pizza was good, but I felt like a little more garlic would've been nice.  The regular pie was unremarkable, except for the occasionally burnt crust.  The pizzas were served very quickly, but the bill took for ever to come... is this how they build the line?  Anyway, it's unquestionably legit New York Pizza, but it's not the best I've had.  This place must be published in tons of tourist books, because almost no one in the line was speaking English.", "author": "Gabe A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-19", "description": "So the pizza was ok......... thankfully i didnt have to wait  in the  long line.....\n\nsmall place, slow service ok pizza..... \n\ncould you beat that??? um yea!", "author": "Gisselle P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-03", "description": "Call ahead and order this pizza to go.

Their pizza is really tasty, it's a thin dough which I like. But the waiting...there were three of us and it was dinner time on Thursday or Friday.

After finally getting to Brooklyn at about 9:30 after taking a lovely unexpected detour (we got lost!) we had to search for parking. My dad warned us that parking could be tough and he was right. We drove around for almost 20 minutes before finding a spot blocks away. If you plan on driving just beware to give yourself extra time to park. \nAfter walking for another 10 blocks we finally got there! The location is beautiful with the Brooklyn bridge in the background. We were surprised to see how long the line was at almost 10 at night. I was so hungry and really wanted to get a seat quickly. Thankfully I was enjoying taking pictures of the skyline so I didn't mind the wait. We only waited about 10 minutes ad them were seated. They don't go in order of the line, the go with party size. If a table for you party amount is ready they will take you in regardless you spot in line.\nWe ordered a pizza half plain half pepperoni and fresh garlic. It took a little time to get it out to our table but it was packed in there so we were expecting that. Then finally, after our whole exclusion getting there, we got our pizza! It was delicious! The Alice's were cooked perfectly, the plain slices were a perfect balance of cheese and sauce and the toppings on the other were so good. Definitely worth the hype and our trek! The slices were actually really big for brick oven and I was filled to content after we were done.

Grimaldi's was the next pizza joint that we hadn't tried yet.  Lombardi's was out of the picture since it failed to impress me the first time.\n\nHow was the wait?\nWe waited for a very long time.  It was about an hour long.  Luckily the weather was nice that night and we were in good company so that made the wait bearable.  \n\nThe service?\nThe service was good.  Our waiter was very entertaining and patient with us when we were ordering our multiple pies.  \n\nThe pizza?\nGrimaldi's cooks their pizza in a coal fired brick oven which gives their pizza a nice charred smokey flavor.  The crust was thin and crispy, their ingredients very fresh and their cheese was very cheesy.  We ordered 4 pizzas, all of them were pretty tasty except the cheese on white sauce.  We actually meant to order just a plain cheese with tomato sauce but made a mistake.  Oh well.  We were pretty stuffed and after the meal is done, you walk outside and you get to see amazing views of the Brooklyn Bridge and the water.", "author": "Elaine C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-05", "description": "Best pizza in my opinion is New York style, and the best New York style in my opinion is Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge!\n\nI just can't give it 5 stars just because although the pizza is delicious, I don't find the whole experience enjoyable.\n\n1. It can get quite touristy. \n2. The line, yea at times it's worth it- but how many times could I endure that line in a year? Hmmmm\n3. The space inside is SO tight, you might be confused as to which table belongs to your party\n\nBuuuut like I've said the pizza is GREAT. My favorite is just the plain pizza with extra basil- Also waiting in line the for restroom while watching the cooks rapidly toss toppings on to the pizza dough and throw 'em to the oven, it could get very entertaining.\n\nMy best recommendation would be to go in as small of a party that you can. You'll be seated way faster. Also eat that pizza quickly! Because it's so thin, it has a tendency to get pretty cool by the 2nd or the 3rd slice.", "author": "Ahris K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-27", "description": "Very disappointed , We heard some much good thing about this place.

There is much hype about this place! \n\nWe were seated and first were a little disappointing that the menu was not as extensive as the Grimaldi's in Douglaston, NY and Garden City, NY. We ended up ordering a cheese pizza and were once again disappointed by the lack of flavor and seasoning. \nWe live closer to the other locations, so we have frequented them more and find that the flavor of the pizza is much better at the Douglaston and Garden City locations. Their menus offer more options such as salads and more toppings, like meatball, which is one of our favorites. \n\nThe location in Brooklyn is nice despite the lack of parking. One can walk the Brooklyn Bridge or visit Pier 11 and indulge in some ice cream from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.\n\nNeedless to say, we were very excited to travel into Brooklyn to have some of the famous Grimaldi's pizza from the \"original\" location, but Queens and Nassau residents are definitely better off saving themselves the trip into Brooklyn and going to their local Grimaldi's.", "author": "T M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-15", "description": "I have been here twice--once to the old location and once to the current location.
