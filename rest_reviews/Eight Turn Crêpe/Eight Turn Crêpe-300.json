From Japan?   \n\nIn the past, I have had terrible experiences eating crepes served out of a paper cone............dry, thick, crunchy....just gross.\n\n  But not at Eight Turn Crepe.  The crepe was delicate, thin and just delicious.   The filling of my salmon crepe was brimming with thinly sliced smoked fish, fresh baby spinach and capers.  Wonderful!

The place gets really crowded so I would just take it to go and not try to stand around for a seat. \n\nI tried the Azuki Berries and it reminded me of my favorite crepe in Tokyo. I personally love the red bean and green tea taste together. The green tea custard was also a nice compliment (not too sweet) to the green tea ice cream.\n\nThe presentation of the crepes is pretty and the window display in the store is nice (just like Japan!).", "author": "Katherine N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-27", "description": "Japanese crepes outside of japan!

These cr\u00eapes are amazingly delicious and pretty. We have tried the Strawberry Banana, TwinkleBerry Parfait, Azuki Berries and Harajuku Fruit Cocktail.

Friendly and helpful staff though.  I should've known better than to stop at a place so close to soho with all the tourists everywhere. \nBeen consistently disappointed in crepes lately. . This one was not good at all. Toppings only on the top of the crepe and the crepe itself was not enjoyable. I dug in right away and it was definitely very crunchy and overdone.

A bit of a too-cool-for-school vibe with street art-inspired wall art and classic rock (60s-00s) rock on the soundtrack. The staff seemed friendly and efficient, but they forgot my order and I had to remind them of it after at least 20 minutes sitting in the shop.\n\nI had the fuji apple pie cr\u00eape and was distinctly underwhelmed, which is surprising considering I love apple pie. The cr\u00eape itself was bland,  the filings not flavorful enough to compensate. That being said, I'd be interested to try one of their savory varieties, but I'm not hopeful for the sweet ones.\n\nBonus for those of the gluten free persuasion: all \ncrepes are made with 100% rice flour.", "author": "Erika K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-08", "description": "I will continue to enjoy French-style savory cr\u00eapes, but I can now also say that Japanese-style dessert cr\u00eapes are awesome. The first time here, we got the Harajuku Fruit Cocktail, which was enough for two to share and had fruit and cream layered in every bite. This was a major point for me since I have often felt gypped on how little filling there is in other cr\u00eapes I've had. Not so here! Fresh and delicious fruit complemented by subtly sweet crunch from first bite to last. Plus they wrap the bottom nicely to avoid that awkwardly-sticky-final-few-bites moment inherent in other street cr\u00eapes.\n\nAlso enjoyed the yuzu slush. Yuzu seems to be a rare and underrated flavor option among other restaurants in the city. A refreshing change here.\n\nSecond time here we got a savory cr\u00eape with shrimp, avocado, and a really tasty sauce. Just the right amount of spice, and I was pleasantly surprised since I usually go right for the sweets...which we then did moments afterward.\n\nVery small place with minimal seating, but all the employees are super friendly. Great for a quick stop to refuel after a lot of walking.", "author": "Lindsey T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-17", "description": "I got the lychee valentine. It was a bit refreshing, a bit sweet, a bit weird. It is definitely different. Not sure if I would order the same thing again. Oh and it didn't come out looking like the picture. Not even close.

It's a very trendy take on lunch or dinner, but I wasn't blown away.\n\nI had the shrimp and avocado crepe, and there just wasn't enough inside the crepe to warrant the price. Also, when they were making my crepe, I saw 1/4 of the avocado fell out and instead of replacing it, they just handed me the food.

First off, the crepe: yummy, lots of options, thoughtful and practical presentation. Second: the staff seemed like a nice bunch. The order taker was very warm and professional. Third, and perhaps most impactful and memorable, was the ambience of this tiny space. Although the square footage between the front door and the kitchen counter couldn't possibly have been any larger than a full-size mattress, there is an open-airy feel, even a breeze created, via the open doorway and glass store front. Vibrant colors and large moving picture screens decorated the walls. They even had an upright i-pad for a modern day register (tech-savvy).  As I waited on a little bench inside the store for my crepe order to come up, I had already had my fill of a beautiful, memorable experience.\n\nP.S.: I added a scoop of green tea ice-cream to the top of my crepe (not a fan of that, but I'm glad I tried it).", "author": "Myra J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-24", "description": "After having a heavy dinner nearby with a friend, dessert is always a must ! I walk by several dessert places and saw the beautiful crepe presented outside of the store. I was eager to try it! I was outside looking at the menu and knew what I wanted. I walked in and there was one employee working on the crepe. He didn't enknowledge me at all. Not even a hi or good evening. I stood there with my wallet out waiting for him to take my order.  Then this other women  came out and went right to the frying station. Did not enknowledge me at all too. I stood there almost 15 mins. There was only one person waiting for their crepe.

However, this one had much higher Yelp rating, so I decided to check it out.\n\nOther reviewers are absolutely correct when it comes to waiting - I had to wait quite a while (about 20 minutes, starting from outside the eatery, to ordering, and another 5-10 minutes before I actually got my food). It wore my patience a bit thin, but I decided to wait it out.\n\nI had a Chicken Thai Crepe, and it was absolutely amazing.

The place is tiny.  Like extremely tiny. Seating for 2 at the window facing the street, but once people start coming in, there's no room for elbows, and claustrophobia definitely becomes a thing.  The service is quick and easy.  Ordering is a breeze.  The only difficult thing to do is to choose which delicious crepe you want to try.\n\nThe crepes are delicious.  All the flavors were delicious, and after devouring one crepe, I honestly wanted another, but decided against it as my stomach was telling me it had reached it's food consumption limit of the day.\n\nIt's a bit pricey for dessert.  $6.50+.

My favorite was the first 5 bites of the shrimp and avocado, the last 5 bites of Turkey Delight, and the entire Lychee Valentine. \n\nThe first 5 of shrimp avocado because the latter part was too sweet.
