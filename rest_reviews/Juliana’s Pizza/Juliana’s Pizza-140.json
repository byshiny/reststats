We chowed on the drizzled oil and crispy crust pie with gooey mozzarella and macked-it all down in record time.\n\nEpic Pizza - well worth the extra wait.", "author": "STEVE B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-28", "description": "This place would of honestly gotten a 5 star review if it wasn't for the long long line outside! \nFirst NY Pizza place I came to, unfortunately we were in a hurry so we did not get to relax and enjoy it to the fullest although the pizza we did get was Super super delicious. \n\nPizza: specialty pizza No.4. This pizza was a 16 inch, with a thin crust, arugula, prosciutto, \u0026 ricotta cheese. Literally amazing. It was shared between 3 people and it was more than enough. \n\nAmbiance: Very family welcoming \u0026 a super mom and pop \"style\" place. \n\nThe customer service was at its top, super friendly everyone I encountered. \n\nThe pricing wasn't too bad for a small pizza which was 16in, it was 29$ .

Juliana's pizza was introduced to me by my sis. By the Brooklyn bridge, it's a nice scenery in the front of the place and authentic looking inside. I've visited Juliana's twice and loved it every time. The margarita pizza and pepperoni is always the best pizza to get. Fresh and delicious, you'll always want to come back for more. Unless the place is full, which it always is once they open the doors. But usually wait time is not that long. When in Brooklyn, please visit Juliana's for great pizza! Also they have great desserts! Every thing is the best!", "author": "David U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-16", "description": "I am undecided between giving it 3.5 stars and 4. The only reason why is because we ate outdoors and the pizza got cold quickly. Yes, our fault.\nHere's the scoop. Always wanting to try Juliana's in the past but was put off by the long line, I finally had the opportunity today.\n\nCatching up with a friend as we strolled along Brooklyn Bridge Park, we decided on pizza ( either here or Grimaldis which I've been to in the past).\nToday's weather was sunny and mid 50s but only for about an hour or so. It was also the reason why we chose to sit outdoors (It started to get chilly real fast and luckily we were nearly done eating).\n\nThere were 2 sizes --small or large, both 8 slices but the small was 16\" while the large was 18\".\nWe chose the large Margarita with no toppings. It came out rather quickly and we devoured it just as quickly.\nThe crust/dough was perfect while the tomato sauce was a bit chunky and adorned with white,  fresh mozzarella. The slices were nearly paper thin.\n\nVerdict? We really enjoyed our first time pizza experience here. No lines (yippee) and 5 star service as we had the nicest waiter. Keep in mind even though there were no lines,  the interior was nearly filled to capacity.  \nI'm a huge pizza lover and would recommend.", "author": "Johanna B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-10", "description": "Countless friends have told me that Juliana's Pizza is the best pizza in the city so when my mom said she wanted to spend a day in the city, I knew just the place to take her.\n\nWe arrived pretty early in the day so only had to wait twenty minutes or so before we got a table. Once we were seated, service was quick and our pizza arrived pretty quickly. \n\nWe ordered the No. 4 based on the recommendation of a friend of mine and it did not disappoint. I had only had prosciutto on a pizza once before and it was one of the best pizzas I had ever had and this was easily on level with it.\n\nI naturally prefer New York style pizza, but Juliana's was definitely one of the best Neapolitan slices I have had and the pizza definitely one worth coming back for.", "author": "Benjamin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-26", "description": "Best pizza I ever had!

We tried the margherita and proscuitto/arugula pizzas. The sauce was special but the crust was soft. When you hold it up, it falls. I prefer a pizza with a more crispy crust, that holds its shape.

I've heard about Juliana's for forever but I've always been loyal to Grimaldi's next door. Now I'm sold, they really are the real deal! \n\nIf you know to come early between their closing times, you can wait in line for like 20 or so minutes and be the first to sit down when they reopen in the afternoon. That's how we got in so easily and it was worth the wait. We got the specialty pizza with prosciutto that was topped with arugula, can't remember the name, but there's only like 2 or 3 specialties. It was REALLY good, so fresh, so satisfying, just perfect. I wish I would've gotten the margarita though since it comes so highly recommended and it's cheaper. \n\nAlso definitely get the Brooklyn Egg Cream too, it's surprisingly SO good and a great end to a great meal.", "author": "Chelsea C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-19", "description": "If you are looking for authentic Brooklyn pizza then this is the place to go!!! Just be prepared to wait. \n\nWent on a July Sunday afternoon and waited about an hour in line... yet totally worth it. They have a lot of great options for salads to meatballs and calzones. The real reason you come here is for the pizza ! We opted for #4 which is tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and then topped with arugula!!\nSo mouthwatering I ate an entire pizza my self. \n\nIf you can't stomach to eat a whole pizza on your own that is okay ! A large will easily feed a party of 4!\n\nAll in all bring water and some snacks while you wait in line but don't fill up so you have room for all those carbs!!!!", "author": "Dakota O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-22", "description": "My friend is literally obsessed with this place, so I was excited to try it out while I was in Brooklyn.

There's a homey, charming elegance to the place, but you have to sit pretty close to other diners. While you're waiting for your own pizzas, your mouth will start watering by looking at dozens of pizzas around you. \n\nWe ordered Calzone pizza and it was absolutely amazing.

There was a line that must have been two hours long at two places that were next to each other, so we decided to order a pizza from each and compare them. I was trying to eat as much pizza as I possibly could while I was in New York so I was all in. \n\nWe got margarita at each and honestly they tasted almost identical. I mean I'm sure some people reading this might be rolling their eyes and say one is waaay better, but it was virtually the same pizza. I mean there were some subtle differences, like one had a slightly sweeter sauce, which my friend said she preferred if she had to pick one. I was indifferent. \n\nI honestly don't remember which was which, but it didn't matter much to me, both were good but I can't say it better than some the wood fire pizza I've had in LA. \n\nNow this totally isn't their fault at all, but I completely regret going here because it was more New York style pizza I missed out on, which I can't get in Los Angeles. It in all sincerity bothers me every time I think about it. \n\nAlso i have to say, had waited in that line I would have been utterly disappointed. I just don't understand waiting in a line that long for anything, much less food. I mean that's not really their fault either, maybe that's why there is place next door. \n\nBut to sum it up, it's solid wood fire pizza and so is the place next door, but neither wowed me or seemed definitively better than their competitor.

Its  not a big establishment. But your best bet order to go and eat at the nearby park. Cash only establishment like most New York businesses so be aware. \n\nFood: ordered a cheese pizza. The pizza was great. Sauce was rich and good texture. Cheese was fresh and tasted amazing. My philosophy is a pizza place needs to be able to wow you on a basic cheese and you know its the one. 4/5. \n\nAtmosphere: The inside is small and you will rub elbows with your neighbor like any other New york restaurant. 4/5. \n\nService: Its always busy so dont sit down if you are restricted by time. Take it to go. Service was pleasant and didnt feel rushed to eat and go  because they have so many other people waiting.
