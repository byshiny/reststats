Gino's on Flatbush is better. Luigi's by the park is way better. Pizza Town on 5th is slightly better. And of course, Artichoke is Artichoke.\n\nThey really need to keep their slices in the oven much longer though. Nothing like getting a slice loaded with toppings and having it come out lukewarm.\n\nGrandma slice is fine.

I went to Yelp and found \"Not Rays\" not to far from the office. When I went in it was small but the employees were nice. They took our order of six pies and said it would be there at 12pm. The price was also great because it was cheaper then I expected. Back at the office, sure enough the pies came two minutes before 12pm. I was truly impressed with that. When the managers came down the pizza was gone quick. Everyone asked where we got it because it was really good. I loved the lasagna slice very much. I will go back from time to time during lunch breaks. I feel it was good enough and the staff was amazing enough to get more of my business.", "author": "Evan C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-12", "description": "Small place but with really good slides.

Ordered a large \"Not Ray's\" pizza and the crust was burnt and inedible around most of the pizza.

But as the old saying goes, like sex... even bad pizza isn't all that terrible.\n\nThey have all the classic slices you expect to find; white stone, pepperoni, square Sicilian, etc... I think they're a bit on the steep side at $3.50/slice, but maybe I'm crazy and have no idea what I'm talking about. But for a quick, cheap meal, it's just fine. \n\nRay's or Not Ray's, I'd still take any of it over Papa John's.

It's convient to get to, it's about a 5 min walk from Atlantic terminal/ Barclay Center 2,3,4,5,B,Q,N,R,D \u0026 LIRR and Layafette on the C train.
