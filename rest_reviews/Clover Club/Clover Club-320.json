First of all it's in beautiful Cobble Hill...home to, well...Me. I've been here several times and I've always walked out with a smile on my face and a satisfied palate. \n\nI recommend you start with their deviled eggs (four flavors) and/or their oysters served with red wine mignonette....continue to order a delicious lamb burger, followed by a mac and cheese (DON'T SHARE). Have a side of the delicious (and greasy) duck fat tossed crisps- no regrets. \n\nI've had other plates on their menu, all of them delightful, these however, are the ones I remember for their simplicity and taste. Enjoy their wednesday live jazz nights and feel free to get up and dance (no one does, but you can change that). I also hear they have amazing cocktails...!", "author": "Miguel H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-18", "description": "High priced but delicious.

Clover Club is gorgeous \u0026 classy, and every cocktail I had was absolutely delicious. Christine the manager was a pleasure to work with, and the process of booking out the back room was seamless and easy. We had our own bartender in the back, Ryan, who made fantastic drinks. The fireplace was definitely a huge added bonus on a cold January night! \n\nHighly recommended for drinks or a private party!", "author": "J B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-01", "description": "Love the atmosphere here. Came here for a friends birthday. This place is great for groups and they have a cute back room. The music here is not super loud so you can actually hear and have a conversation with your friends without having to scream into their ears. The drinks and food here are amazing..

You can go for before dinner drinks. You can go for after dinner drinks. First date? Yep. Hundredth date? Even better. Girls night out. Mixed group. Family in town. Craving a drink and bored with vodka tonics. Killing time. Celebrating a birthday. Etc etc.\n\nThey have a huge drink list, which changes ever so often, and features a wide range of beverages to please any palate. They have an outstanding brunch featuring a full menu, but at night they just serve bar snacks. Classy bar snacks like duck fat potato chips with truffled creme fraiche, but snacks nonetheless. In fact, if there is a downside to the Clover Club, I sometimes wish they served a full menu in the evenings too. It may not be logical for them, or maybe they just want to focus on drinks, but their brunch options are so damned delicious I think they'd make great dinner.\n\nA great place to have in the neighborhood, and definitely worth the short trip from Manhattan.", "author": "Diana R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-27", "description": "Stopped by for a lovely breakfast one Saturday morning.

The bar was dark and noisy, lit by either perfectly dimmed lights or lots of candles.  We had to elbow our way to the bar and found a cocktail menu of drinks I was completely unfamiliar with.  A Brooklynette do-gooder saw me struggling, but heard my girlfriend mention her desire for Champagne and she jumped in with a perfect recommendation for their pear-Champagne concoction (not to be found on the menu).  I went with my bourbon manhattan standby which was easily one of the best of I've ever had.  \n\nEither I was remarkably comfortable in the space or it actually didn't take long, but we were able to get seated in a cozy candle-lit table in what felt like a short period of time.  There  we were able to order drinks and food without the chaos of being at the bar.  \n\nDespite having a wonderful time, I can't give it 5 stars for a few reasons.  I was overwhelmed by the pressure of ordering at the bar.  Between the foreign menu items and the intensity of the bartender, and the number of people wanting to order, I was definitely not feeling sure of myself.  When the drinks ended up costing $13 apiece, I felt pretty lucky that we liked what we got.  My advice would be to try ordering your favorite drink and seeing how they do it.  I ordered mine out of panic, but it totally blew my mind.  If that's not your scene, grab a table and order through a server.  Was much less pressure.  The turn around from the server was also extremely quick given how long it took the bartender just to make the drinks while I was watching.  \n\nNot perfect for me, but definitely a unique is experience with top of the line cocktails.

Also, the bartender was super sweet and chatty. I like chatty. And to top things off, there were a couple of girls a few stools away who were friendly and a hoot to talk to.
