Try stopping into Junior's after class or during you  lunch break. It's slapped dab in the middle of Downtown, Brooklyn. So whether you work for a company or you're a student, you can always count on Junior's to fulfill your appetite. It's an American Restaurant, so you'll find a good variety of food, I love their burgers and fries. But if you're more of a health freak, then you shouldn't be reading me reviews to begin with, ;) I've always enjoyed their food and love their cheesecake.

It was a huge piece of cheese cake for 7.75. The coffee was good. Fresh and hot. The place is clean and a great place to go for breakfast or lunch. Parking is an issue down there but it's worth it.

A mother with her son. Perhaps she didn't like that I gave my child a choice and he took a while deciding. Perhaps she was mad that I lingered for a while over the cute Valentine's cupcakes with heart-shaped sprinkles. Or, perhaps she's just a miserable person that loves company. In any case she didn't want me to order more than a quarter pound of cookies. I tried and she said no. \n\nI complained to the manager about it and he said he would take care of it and walked to the back. I have no faith in that, and I chose to leave soon after I spoke to him.

The portions were generous, the fries wide and thick, soft and airy on the inside. \nThe food was a pleasant surprise on this Thanksgiving.\n\nThis might sound odd, but sitting there I had the strangest feeling I'd been there before...It must be the decor which looks very retro, but retro in a good way. And way better than the \"chic\" places that are dotting brooklyn's gentrifying neighborhoods and creating a vibe of exclusivity and snobbery. \n\nJuniors was just 100% welcoming.\nI had no room for desert, so I asked for a cheesecake to-go.

First of all, this was such a surprise to see Junior's literally down the block from our hotel. We came up for a girl's weekend and this was the FIRST thing we ate. \n\nThe wait was 0 minutes. The server, Davie, was handsome and courteous...did I mention handsome lol. He was on point, accurate and considerate. The 3 of us ordered, I had the BBQ Shrimp \u0026 Chicken with collards and Carrot Cake Cheesecake. The food was perfectly cooked. The cake was to die for. \nAlso, this place SERVES APPLETON RUM, which might not seem like much to NYC natives, but it's a HARD FIND in bars/restaurants in DC (my hometown).\n\nAll in all, I will be back.

I was so full from my dinner - a HUGE portion that I only ate about half of - but still managed a few bites of the strawberry topped cheesecake.

I had a pulled pork sandwich that came with fries, fried zucchini \u0026 drink included. \n\nI took about 1/2 the meat off the sandwich to have for lunch the next day!\n\nWe tried a few different flavors of the cheesecake \u0026 other treats - all of it was fantastic.

Sadly, Walter Rosen passed away this year but the restaurant continues as it was. Located at DeKalb Avenue, the original location been around since 1950. A New York landmark, Junior's has maintained its authenticity, despite a suspicious fire back in 1981. Traveling to Junior's for their famous cheesecake is literally a rite of passage for any New Yorker. What some may not realize is you can still order some of their quirky old fashioned drinks such as the Orange Fizz. Very unique \u0026 refreshing. The egg creams are top notch too. As for the rest of the menu, I've tried a few things but everyone knows that you go here for the cheesecake. There's a large selection of items but don't even think about it. Just get the strawberry cheesecake. \n\nAnd by the way, if you're thinking of going to one of the Junior's in Manhattan, don't go to those until you've tried the Brooklyn one first. Theoretically, there shouldn't be a difference but it's a completely different dining experience. Well worth the trip to Brooklyn.", "author": "Marie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-07", "description": "Juniors is alright the food is average nothing special except their cheese cakes I guess. Its a bit over price for the quality of the food that they serve, but lots of tables and super fast service if its not too busy. Had an average experience waiter messed up my order and I knew more about the wine than The bartender who seemed clueless and was just spitting random words together to give an answer. So I just got a glass of what I know. Their loss because I was wanting a bottle of something different to try that morning. Although my order was messed up the waiter was polite and very very professional I think she was new and just nervous have her a nice tip too :) .
