I have never had a Banh Mi sandwich before so this was the perfect spot for Jim and I to hit up before attending the Yelp Elite event.  For $5.50 you get a generous helping of spicy ground pork, carrots, cucumbers, pate and Vietnamese  ham. I mean this sandwich was literally bursting at the seams.  The addition of fresh cilantro was also a great touch.  \n\nThe restaurant is small and modest but busy.  Service was prompt and efficient.  I recommend this spot for a cheap and tasty meal.", "author": "Natasha U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-11-19", "description": "I had their coconut bubble tea, it was horrible. But boba was hard as if it had been out for days, and the tea it self tasted burnt and it was barley sweetened. I was disappointed to know that they did not serve warm bubble tea, since it is cold outside. Many other bubble tea places that I have tried have been much better, for a better price, and have had both hot and cold bubble tea options. I did not try anything else in the restaurant but the place did smell nice and was very nicely decorated.", "author": "Adrianne M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-13", "description": "I make it a point to try new restaurants in New York as much as I can, but I just can't stop coming back to Hanco's. My boyfriend and I discovered this gem a few months ago thanks to Scoutmob. It's our #1 lunch destination now and we don't even live in the neighborhood. (Yet. There's serious talk of moving to Park Slope, and the time we've spent there following meals at Hanco's is responsible for it.)\n\nI always get the tofu banh mi, medium spicy. I had the full spicy my first time and it was pretty delicious until the last couple bites. I guess all the spicy mayo sank to the bottom and upon taking my last bites I literally felt like I had gotten some sort of chemical burn on and in my mouth. I'm no wuss either, I love me some spicy food.\n\nHanco's definitely beats out copycat Henry's down the block. (NPR even did a bit about the blatant rip off: http://ny.eater.com/tags/hancos) I'm ashamed to admit that I did try Henry's once out of curiosity, and although they offer more fake meat options (Hanco's only has fake pork), it just wasn't as delicious as trusty Hanco's. Also, Henry's seating area is tiny and it just generally lacks the friendly and comfortable atmosphere that Hanco's offers. Perhaps most importantly, the bubble tea at Henry's wasn't as good. The almond bubble tea tasted pretty much like plain milk, and my boyfriend didn't much like his coconut bubble tea (although I did. It tasted more like natural coconut milk and less like artificial flavoring. Just a matter of preference, I think.)\n\nHanco's sandwiches are a dollar or so more expensive, but it's worth it. Plus they give you a stamp card that gets you a free sandwich and bubble tea after the purchase of nine.", "author": "Brady Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-23", "description": "Great banh mi sandwiches!  This very small, unassuming place in Boerum Hill is actually a delight.  I chose a traditional banh mi sandwich which I took to be spicy.  The ingredients were of good quality.  I was particularly impressed with the very fresh cilantro.  The ground pork was nicely spicy and very flavorful.  I loved the pate, and the carrots gave great texture.  The bread itself was a touch untraditional though.  Not quite a traditional baguette, but the added texture was still there.  Definitely recommend it.  I additionally had the Vietnamese coffee, but I couldn't drink much of it.  I typically take my coffee black and prefer it strong, so it being sweet was something I just couldn't allow myself to get used to.  Oh well.  I still had a great time!  Be sure to check this place out if you are in the neighborhood.", "author": "Jim U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-19", "description": "Bubble tea is all I got here. They have a loyalty program for bubble tea and banh mi. Interesting. The tapioca is served hard here without much sweetness. The drink flavors are the standard fare.

Full of meat and veggies (shredded carrots and turnips) on toasted bread, nice and crispy on the outside.  Order spicy for a nice kick.  Their bubble tea is expensive, $4+ for a 16 oz.

I also like adding siracha to everything, so this always poses some internal conflict.).\n\nI'm a bahn mi traditionalist, so I've only ever ordered the classic here, but there are still hopefully a couple of tidbits I can add to contribute something to the discourse:\n\n1) when you get the sandwich, position the bread with the opening on top, push it down, and close the opening by pushing the sides on the top together. this corrects the lop-sided ingredient distribution while maintaining the stability of the sandwich. I don't know that anyone else has figured this out yet.\n\n2) the bubble tea is good... the vietnamese ice coffee is better, especially if you go the extra-spicy route on the bahn mi. nothing cuts through a really spicy bahn mi like a milky/sweet ice coffee.\n\n3) last time I was there, they had a wheat bread option!!! \n\n(I guess you can ignore that bahn mi traditionalist comment from earlier, because I'm a sucker for wheat bread.)", "author": "Jake D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "description": "This place has the best taro boba milk tea I have ever had.
