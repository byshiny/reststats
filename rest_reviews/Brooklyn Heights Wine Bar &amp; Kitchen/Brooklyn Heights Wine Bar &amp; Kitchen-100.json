And then continue to badger the customer on said topic, pointing out all things you think you did right.\n\nThat said, the food here is fresh and delicious and under very specific circumstances I wouldn't be surprised to find myself eating here again, obviously, never if I'm pressed for time.\n\nFinal note: I'm giving this place a 3, a part of me wants to give it a 2 and if the waitress had been delightful, I would have given this place a 4. One final note on the waitress, I don't think she was intentionally being a jerk, I think that perhaps, she isn't well-suited to customer service of this kind, she takes things too personally and reacts to them too defensively.", "author": "Frances G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "description": "A great place where you can talk, good for dates. They have a large variety of wines and the good was very good. I had a special that was a grilled octopus and white bean salad, very tasty, the octopus was amazing! I would definitely go back! One entr\u00e9e and a glass of wine plus tax and tip were $30 USD, so not a cheap place but worth its value. They could have more Chilean wines on their menu, which are good value and high quality.", "author": "Maria H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-11", "description": "Great service.

But when taken as a whole with everything else Brooklyn, or NYC has to offer, don't coming running here. The food is just average.  The noise level is quite high.  Good beer and wine selection.  Good sliced meat plate.  Burger could have been much better and served with slightly stale and damp Ruffles potato chips.

Went with a glass of Chard, seeing the weather will soon be cool enough for me to start craving a big glass of red.\n\nThe ambiance is somewhere between casual and romantic, and is a bit more spacious than most wine bars I've been to having a bar as well as several tables.  It was a bit quiet on Sunday night, but I was happy since I was looking for a quiet and relaxing evening.  \nThis place is a solid bet if your in the mood for a relaxing night of wine with a friend.

Forget that we had burgers and she made us sit there and wait for 10 minutes for condiments, then came over and mumbled \"how is everything\", then we told her and we waited another full 5 minutes til the burger was cold. It didn't matter that much. Really. Everyone makes mistakes and I've done it myself. What mattered is that we were there for a full 2 hours tonight and she never smiled. She was so clearly miserable and so full of disdain (for us?) that it was awkward. She was waiting on a table full of restaurant people (20 plus years in NYC) and we were all baffled by her inability to be pleasant (she was cordial at best, but hardly). Our friend who got their first said the bartender was no better (uppity is how she put it). Personally I have opened some of the most expensive restaurants in NY (hired and trained the staff) and the one thing I can't tolerate is a staff that treats their guests like they are not cool enough or worthy enough to be there. In that regard, this place gets 2 stars. \n\nTo be fair, the food was lovely (4 stars). The dates with blue cheese and prosciutto was rich and luscious as an app. The octopus was tender and plush and perfectly paired with white beans (and that is really hard to accomplish!) The burgers were good (if a little over cooked and cold by the time we got some mayo) but the wine list was nice and affordable.\n\nOver all the place is cute. Nice ambiance, tasteful little space, bright and airy but there are just too many places that make you feel welcome, or at the very least appreciate your business to put up with the flat out ambivalence  we experienced (that said, the busser was super nice! and very gracious!).\n\nI'm gonna say maybe our waitress was having a bad day and leave it at that, but come on people, this is called THE SERVICE INDUSTRY.", "author": "Susan L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-17", "description": "Bartender was lovely, it was cozy inside and wine was okay.

A cute little place with a nice outdoor seating area and fun ambience -- feels very vintage.  \n\nWe enjoyed a meat and cheese plate - soppressata with a cheese pairing recommended by the waitress, and phenomenal.

I love the simple ambiance and the fact that they have outdoor seating and large wall to wall windows in the front. I hate the dark dingy feeling of most bars in the city, so it's quite relaxing to sip on a glass of wine in one of the high bar tables up in front. They have a decent selection of wines from around the world and the prices are very reasonable for the quality ($7.5 for a glass of delicious french rose!) They have great happy hour specials too.\nDon't come here for the food because you probably will be disappointed. However, if you're wanting a quiet laid back place to have drinks with an old friend?
