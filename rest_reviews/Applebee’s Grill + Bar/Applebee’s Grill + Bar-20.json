The service was terrible. Walked in the place was dense not alot of customers, noticed the fat ass security guard talking to the hostess, were not attentive to customers coming in at all. Told me to wait 5 minutes for a party of two. It took 30 minutes to get seated and half the restaurant was empty. Sat down to dirty silverware, could clearly see they were not washed properly if they washed them at all. The young lady who took our order, drinks everything included was very incompetent. We were seated for 1 hr 15 minutes and didnt even get a drink of water. The staff is majority young black thots I am just being honest nothing professional about this place so never again.", "author": "Danielevrod F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-11", "description": "The service here is terrible.... actually scratch that. This place should be shut down. I came in tonight to meet my friend for happy hour. It wasn't even busy and we had to wait 10 minutes for the bartender to [not wipe the bar counter] come over with a cocktail napkin that she ran under the faucet to wipe down the condiment sauce in front of me. I then told her that I'd wait for someone to come over and sanitize the counter with a rag. She then proceeded to tell me that they ran out of rags and that she could go in the back to put some sanitizer on the cocktail napkin that was already falling apart... Excuse me? But that is beyond gross. We then had to wait even longer to have the saucy counter cleaned and not once did she ask us for our drink order during the time. We finally managed to trouble her for a drink after she repeatedly held up her finger and told us that she needed to close out another party. The service was extremely slow after receiving our first drinks. When we finally got the drinks, my friend made a simple request for a lime with his drink. She actually grabbed his drink from him and proceeded to plop a lime smack dab in his neat tequila. Seriously? Aside from violating 39 health codes from this, how did she know how much lime he wanted in his shot?? I wasn't even able to get a second drink until the very end of my time at the bar. The bartender never checked on us and she kept disappearing. Of course it wouldn't have been proper by then, if she hadn't charged us regular prices for the happy hour margaritas that we ordered. I didn't even care at that point, I just wanted to leave. Seriously. This place needs to either close or they need to clean house.", "author": "Lydia H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-14", "description": "Waited at the host's post for 30 mins.

Things started out OK but as anticipated quickly deteriorated after we were seated (at a table that was freezing, it was 13 degrees outside). 20 mins after our order was taken, another waitress walks up to the table \"Hi are you ready to order?\"...assume the first girl never entered it. We waited 40 mins for COLD coffee and hot chocolate (when we mentioned it was cold she just shrugged and walked away instead of offering to bring hot ones) an additional 40min for salads (!!!) no silverware, no napkins, and terrible waitress (#1) who forgot the fries and clean bottle of ketchup that we ordered (one on the table was disgusting \u0026 empty) and never checked in after we got our food. \n\nThe only saving grace was the new manager Tracey-Ann who was just transferred, I could tell she was new to this location because when we first walked in she actually warmly greeted us. When we complained of everything she discounted accordingly. I hope she can turn this place around---I literally ONLY wrote this review to give her due praise.\n\nBottom line with Dekalb \u0026 Gotham markets blocks away the competition has escalated, get your ish together Applebee's", "author": "Jen H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-16", "description": "The cook is shitty!

The host wiped down the table but it was wet. We did receive menus and sat for another 16-20 minutes without ever having a server stop to even offer water. Three servers were standing at the cashier near the bar, and the couple next to us asked the waiting servers for water and were told, \"that's not my section. Your server is busy.\" He asked how long he'd have to wait (he'd been waiting at least 10 minutes) and was told \"I don't know.\" in the rudest tone I've ever heard from a server.

I try not to write negative reviews because it may just have been me but this Applebee's Location is already known to have the worse of the worse service. To the point where I think they make being a horrible worker a qualification to work there. So we strolled in Applebee's because they supposedly had a promotion of $1 Margaritas. So the hubby and I had time to kill before a movie so we waited to be seated, wasn't too long of a wait. Then once we were seated over by the bar area and we waited 25 minutes ( no lie, I kept track of the time because we still had a movie to catch ) just for the waitress to decide to come over and bring the menus. When we first sat she zoomed by us and said she would be right with us, then 25 mins later she gave us the menus and disappeared again, then 15 mins later after I talked to a manager looking fellow, she popped up just to tell us that the promotion didn't apply to this location that they were only doing it in the Coney Island location. Note the whole time she was talking to us, she had a attitude like we were holding her up from something and she did us a favor by stopping to take our order. \u00a0\n\nGranted so much time has now been wasted, and her lack of hospitality was starting to urk me we just ordered two drinks from the bar anyway. The bar was probably about 3 feet away from us, so how long could it take to whip up some alcohol and put it in a cup. They obviously proved me wrong, 20 mins passed from giving the girl our order and not even a glass or water much less a bar drink or utensils for the appetizer we ordered graced the table. \n\nWe kindly walked out, they obviously skipped the customer service portion of the job when they were training these people. I've been to hole in the wall spot's that are constantly bust that have better service than what this Applebee's was giving. They need to just close this dirty location.", "author": "Elethia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-11", "description": "So I don't my bad review will mean anything after seeing all the bad reviews written by everyone else. This restaurant claims to close at midnight, but they turn the lights on, turn off TVs and begin handing out checks at 11pm!! A customer walks in at 11pm because you say you're open until 12!! An 11pm customer should have the same experience as a customer at 5pm!! And I say this a former restaurant manager!! To feel a bit rushed at 11:45 is one thing but an hour before closing is ridiculous.

However, a relative of mine was in NYC and wanted to get a quick bite, and I suggested Applebee's. It was a Friday evening back in August and it was pretty crowded, the hostess said it would be about 15 minute wait, and it turned out to be a bit less. She sat us toward the back and said a server would be around shortly, that was not the case, she took quite awhile.\n\nI opted to get two items from the 2 for $24 menu...my daughter had the chicken tenders and fries, I had the Tilapia with potatoes and broccoli. I actually didn't have the highest expectations for my meal but they were exceeded. The Tilapia was well seasoned as were the potatoes. \n\nHowever, the service left a lot to be desired, she took awhile to take the order, she disappeared and didn't ask if we needed anything, and the food took quite awhile to come out. While I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants I received much better service at the Applebee's located just a few blocks away at Atlantic Terminal.\n\nIn short, thumbs up for the food, but thumbs down for the lackluster service.", "author": "Jason R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-04", "description": "Unprofessional customer service Doetha the host at the front was not at the post.

At that point, I asked for the supervisor and he took 10 minutes to come out. Jardert the manager was unprofessional as well.
