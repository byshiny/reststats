It combines the ease of customization \u00e0 la Chipotle, the heartiness of Five Guys, and relatively healthy options like Bigeye Sushi. The lines move very quickly and there's usually seating available, despite the small space. Of all the protein options I've tried, I would recommend the gojuchang pork-- it's addictively sweet and spicy especially paired with their mild and smoky Korilla sauce. I miss the easy accessibility of their East Village location, but this Metrotech location is relatively easy to get to as well via Jay Street-Metrotech (A/C/F/R).", "author": "Michelle C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-14", "description": "I randomly walked into this place on a Sunday and was pleasantly surprised. Fortunately for me, Korilla was pretty empty at the time of my visit. All I have to say is that this place is great. First, they really load you up with food with a low price tag of $11 (you really cannot beat that). My dish had enough food for two separate feeding . . . although I ate it all in one sitting. The restaurant, with the assembly line style of food preparation, reminds me a bit of Chipotle. Maybe Chipotle was on my mind because there is one a few storefronts down. \n\nI would highly recommend going for the spicy pork, the bacon rice, and the Korilla sauce. Actually, I can only recommend it because that is what I had during my visit; I'm sure the other selections are just as tasty. \n\nAlthough I dined here on a Sunday, I would image that this place would be quite packed on weekdays. There is seating at Korilla, but it gives me more of take-out vibe because the seating arrangement looks a bit awkward.", "author": "Kwame S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-09", "description": "After having Korilla in BK bookmarked for some time now, we made this the 1st stop of our food crawl a couple of weeks ago. I was a little disappointed at the 3.5-star rating on Yelp but decided I needed to check it out for myself anyway. And boy am I glad I did!\n\nFor those who have never heard of Korilla, think \"Korean food truck meets Chipotle\". I ordered a Salad bowl w. bulgogi, roasted corn, blue potato salad, \u0026 red kimchi and topped with Korilla sauce and Korean Hot Sauce. The flavors were quote nice and I liked the variety of items that this bowl was comprised of. The bulgogi itself was tender and all the ingredients were of good quality. The portion size was pretty good, and our server was very nice and made good suggestions when I asked her what I should include in the bowl.\n\n\nThe price itself was more than fair for what you get and there is seating around a large table in the middle of the place. Unfortunately, unlike other neighboring eateries, there was no outdoor seating available, but the table inside easily accommodate our party of 7 adults + 5 kids.", "author": "Godley V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-24", "description": "Omg, I discovered this place by word of mouth.\nThe inside is not so welcoming to sit and eat there.\n\nIt's more like a pick and go type of place.\n\nYou can create your own bowl or go by their recommendation. Usually meat or tofu, wild rice or kale, kimchee, purple potato, pickles with your choice of sauce.\n\nDrinks are pretty good: matcha latte is one of them.\n\nIf you are in the downtown Brooklyn area, check this place out.

I wandered around the area and decided to eat here for lunch one day. It is basically Korean chipotle, but with fewer toppings to choose. You are limited to only 3 toppings here, but it was filling enough for me.\n\nI ordered white rice with bulgogi, roasted corn, blue potato salad, red kimchi, and Korilla sauce. Bulgogi was nice but wished it was warmer and came in a bigger serving. The corn was just regular corn, nothing too special but I love corn with rice bowls so it was nice to have as an option. The kimchi was authentic, more acidic than I would normally prefer. But it was good and spicy! Lastly, the blue potato salad was the highlight of my meal. I don't even know where the BLUE in my potato salad came from (blue potatoes perhaps?), but it was SO good. It was creamy, a little sweet, and the small chunks of potato added the perfect texture.\n\nI would say Korilla at this location probably isn't as high quality as their other locations only because it is kind of a campus dining establishment. The meat definitely could be fresher and have bigger portions for the price ($11), but it's next to a college, so it's expected. Seating here is a little awkward since it's more of a to-go kind of place. It's a smaller place so you could be eating in front of someone you don't know, or facing the workers.", "author": "Sammi K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-01-09", "description": "This is my first time eating Korean BBQ, so I was unsure of what to expect at first. Upon entering the restaurant, I was impressed with their decor as well as the cafeteria style service. It is very similar to that of Chipotle. \n\nI had a bowl with Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice, Ginger Soy Chicken, Pico de Gallo, Blue Potato Salad (this was different for sure), and the Red Kimchi. \n\nI would definitely return here, however it is not a restaurant I would be able to eat at regularly.

It was surprisingly solid and the the spicy pork was really tasty. I am deducting a star because they could have put more meat inside the bowl. 10.50 for lunch and for the area you're in, that's a pretty good deal.

The line was pretty long, but my friends and I were in and out of the store within 15 minutes.\n\nI ordered a salad bowl with gochujang pork, and my 3 sides were red kimchi, blue potato salad (so unique and delicious, but seasonal) and baby bok choy. I requested the K'lla sauce (the one they advertise as their spiciest) to be lightly drizzled on top of everything. First of all, I do not recommend getting a salad bowl - I don't think the heaviness of the ingredients complements salad well - if you're going to Korilla in the first place, go all out, forget about carb-counting and order the rice bowl. The spicy meat options go much, much better with rice than a few leafy greens - I probably would have enjoyed my lunch more. \n\nIt might have been my fault ordering literally the spiciest things on the menu, but this place would probably be a \"treat myself\" type of place, one I wouldn't frequent. Everything is just a little bit too heavy and dare I say, too flavorful! Which is a good problem to have if I'm eating by myself and starving, but probably not the best option for a weekday work lunch. This is definitely not a place I would recommend grabbing lunch, the ingredients are messy and are difficult to eat elegantly. In addition, the smells of the food itself are quite pungent, and the garlicky taste lingers in your mouth for about 3-4 hours after. Nonetheless, I cannot deny that the food is objectively tasty, deliciously spicy, and portion sizes are massive.", "author": "Claire L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-17", "description": "Best veggie dumplings in the area and great price!
