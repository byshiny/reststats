I live just down the block and thought I'd try Lean Crust after reading favourable reviews and liking their menu. \n\nI ordered a large pizza and had two slices for dinner and chalked up my queasy stomach to tiredness and having an off day. I spent a portion of my evening in the bathroom and thought it was 'evening sickness'.\nThe next day I didn't feel well, but had an appetite so I heated up two more slices and was violently ill a short while later. I'm lucky it wasn't worse- I heaved my entire stomach contents and felt lethargic and nauseous for the rest of the day. Stuff happens. I write this because i called Lean Crust to ask if maybe the batch of goat cheese on my pizza was off...the restaurant said the manager was not available and insisted it couldn't have been their pizza that made me ill. I called today and got someone else who was polite but offered the same insistence and disbelief.

I don't love pizza like the average person seems to, but I definitely missed it a little. It seemed like a worthwhile pursuit to take whilst in the big city.\n\nLean Crust was exceptional. I ordered two quite massive slices on the quinoa crust. One had just vegetable toppings, and the white pizza with chicken. The texture was perfect - I didn't feel like I was missing anything with the gluten-free option at all. It was perfectly crispy and it held together well.\n\nFor the giant slices you get, the price is right.", "author": "Alex B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-27", "description": "The place itself is clean with an A rating. One thing that sets them apart is the option of non-refrigerated water (my preference). \n\nI had the vegan pizza which has unlimited toppings (mushrooms, broccoli, peppers, pumpkin, \u0026 spinach) all for the same price! It was flavorful and filling which is not always the case with a veggie option. \n\nTheir refreshment selection is quite limited (they have 2 flavors of Perrier)", "author": "Shanice W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-03", "description": "Please do not get the calamari from here.

Finding gluten free slices is hard, finding vegan slices is hard, finding both of them together is nearly impossible and I haven't seen anyone else do that so bravo Lean Crusts. The sauce was delicious, and the vegan cheese tasted so similar to real cheese (they use Daiya I believe but somehow it tasted better than Daiya usually does)! The only downside is that each slice was around $5 but it's understandable because gluten free crust and vegan cheese are more expensive.", "author": "Meganne N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-23", "description": "This is your typical no-frills pizza place with good pricing and some really excellent toppings, like the mutli-mushroom pizza with truffle oil slice for only 3$. \n\nI cannot complain, and I think the prices are more than fair.", "author": "Jason W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-20", "description": "I am a fan of their pizza, but that's about it.\n\nThe guy I talked to behind the counter didn't have any answers to my questions about making  pies vegan and which slices were already vegan. He had to ask someone else. Not sure if it was a language barrier or if he just didn't know. If he didn't know, someone should let him know so the business can run smoothly and not discourage customers.\n\nThe prices were really high, too. Two slices of vegan veggie pizza for almost $11. Yup, you read that right. It probably would've been more worth it to order a small pie for $14, but I couldn't finish it all. But, the pizza was good, so I will give it that. The crust held up to the abundance of veggies (zucchini, carrot, eggplant, etc.) that were piled on. The amount of cheese (probably Daiya from the texture) was just enough to not overpower anything.\n\nOverall, a solid slice, but not something I would eat too frequently because of how expensive it is.", "author": "Angela C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-07", "description": "I have traveled far and wide in this world searching and trying my favorite food item: PIZZA. Every kind, even deep into southern Italy's oldest pizzerias, Brooklyn, NYC and beyond...and this is GREAT sliced pizza! \nNow to me, all types of pizza can be great. This type is something of a rarity, as they have gluten free, soy cheese as well as salad style pizzas and regular nyc pizza. \nI am having the amazing salad pizza and am thrilled and stunned i haven't stopped by here ever before!

Fort Greene to me has always felt a bit lackluster when it comes to dining places, but Lean Crust is a true gem.\n\nStaff: The staff is always friendly and delivery is often, if not always, quick.\n\nFood: Is budget-friendly and the ranges are solid. I've often ordered their freshly handmade pasta, which takes 10 minutes to make and 15 minutes to receive. If that's not consistent, then I don't know what is. Their pasta dishes have variety and each are great IMO. The Penne a la Vodka is a personal favorite, and so is the Lasagna. As for pizza, I recommend the Buffalo slices/pies. They're delicious and  quiet affordable and then the remainder of their menu, is fair game. I'm modest and usually just stick to what I like, but I haven't tried anything so far that I haven't liked. The gluten slice is popular, but I'm not bold enough to try it. Calzones are cheap, but extremely filling too.\n\n\nOverall: This is a great place to come to if you're in the area. The food has quality and the prices are well-affordable for the neighborhood.

They offer some delicious options via delivery which aren't usually available by the slice. The only thing that really bothers me is that if you order delivery the delivery guy is too lazy to actually bring the pizza to your door (you know, like every other restaurant in the city) and instead will call you and ask you to come downstairs to get it from him.

When our pizza arrived, it looked as though a male witch (warlock?) had ejaculated in a swirl across it-- tasted like it too. How they had the gall to call that green stuff, \"pesto\" is beyond me.
