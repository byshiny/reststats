Maybe I got the wrong dessert the first time but I initially rated Mia's a 2. I've been back 3 times since and its been quite good\nAtmosphere (3) Clean, not too crowded but kind of sterile. Better suited for takeout   \nFood (4) - Pumpkin cheesecake (4+), chocolate chip cookie (4+ - chewy, borderline doughy), Oreo cupcake (4), vanilla cupcake (4), coffee cake (3 - very good cake but needs more topping!), apple strudel cheesecake (1 - this was from a year or two ago; in retrospect, it appears to have been an anomaly).\nService (3-) Ordering from the counter is a little haphazard because there doesn't appear to be a line so people coming after you can end up getting their order filled first. The one time I ate-in, I waited 15 minutes before having to flag down a bus boy to get service. The waiter was friendly but clueless \nCost = Cupcakes and cookies are around $3 and a slice of cake about $6", "author": "Will S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-16", "description": "The cookies were to die for!!!

Last minute I found out it was a co-workers birthday and we needed a cake. We usually go to Court St. Pastry and get a cannoli cake. Everyone was tired of cannoli so I googled bakeries near me and Mia's bakery popped up. I figured we would try someplace different but was not expecting much. I went in and bought a 7 layer cake and the extremely helpful, very friendly girl behind the counter wrote Happy Birthday on it for me. Upon checkout I purchased 1 honey nut cookie that they had by the register. I told her not to put it in a bag and ate it while I walked to the car. The cookie was moist and delicious and tasted exactly as advertised of sweet honey and crunchy nuts. I had to stop myself from going to buy a few more remembering I was about to have cake shortly. After we sang happy birthday and cut the cake everyone was raving about it and asking where I bought it. This place is clean, cute and delicious. Since my office is only 2 blocks away, looks like we found a new bakery for birthday cakes and to satisfy our sweet tooth. Can't wait to try other items from Mia's bakery. If you are in the area give it a try. You won't be sorry. I guess I should mention it's a little pricey but it is in downtown Brooklyn so everything is pricey.", "author": "Crystal L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-01", "description": "Huge variety of cakes, cookies, pastries, cupcakes and desserts which all look amazing in the window but unfortunately aren't particularly good. On the positive side, the place is attractively decorated, staff are very friendly and they have a cute coffee bar. But the cakes are quite bland and the frosting has a very plastic margarine-ey taste. I've tried four of their cakes now and they've all been suffering from the same lack of freshness. I can't judge on the pastries or anything else so maybe I'm just ordering wrong with the cakes?", "author": "Foodie L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-24", "description": "Great selection of yummy baked goods, nice atmosphere, and cute garden.

I spent about $120 on 12 or so slices that were the worst desserts I have ever eaten. The tiramisu was very sour, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e smelled like eggs., the bread pudding was just stale bread., let's not even talk about the cheesecake. The strawberries and the fake whipped cream on the strawberry shortcake was just a complete embarrassment.
