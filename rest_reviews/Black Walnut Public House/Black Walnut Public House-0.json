The drinks at the bar were good, nothing super craft-cocktail, but good drinks. \n\nFor bites we got Charred Brussel Sprouts-- Slivered almonds, lemon and cranberries) and the Crispy Smashed Potato Skins-- Smashed red bliss, sage, Parmesan and zesty ranch). Both were really good bar food and we finished them (I even used some of the Brussel Sprouts to grab the last of the ranch!). \n\nHaving had a good experience with light bites at the bar, I ordered from BW for room service (they service the Hilton where they're located). I got a few smaller dishes for lunch, which ended up totaling over $50 with tip. Here's what I got:\n\n- (HARD PASS- SEE PICS) Arugula Salad-- Described on the menu as consisting of Aged ricotta and crispy chickpeas to top. This was the most underwhelming salad I've gotten in a while. It was a small heap of arugula, coated in some extremely salty oil, with what looked like shaved parmesan and some fried chickpeas (that were not crispy because of the dressing). I called because I thought there was a mistake- having expected a heap of creamy ricotta. I told them I wanted to send it back and after talking to the kitchen, the gentleman told me that was the aged ricotta. I told him I've never seen ricotta like that and that they should specify it on the menu because that was not at all what one would expect when hoping for \"aged ricotta.\" And for $12, this was a real let-down. They didn't take it back.\n\n- (HARD PASS- SEE PICS) Braised Pork Bao Bun-- Described as Crispy buns, Korean chili, sesame, carrots, pickled daikon. SIGH. At $4/bun I was really excited for something special. What I got instead were two heavily fried bao buns with a sliver of filling. I took one bite and oil was literally dripping down my chin and fingers from the friend buns. I ended up opening them and scooping one bite of filling out of each. That was an expensive two bites- even for NYC! I just don't know why they would fry these delicate buns. All they do is soak in all of the oil. Eek...\n\n- (WOULD ORDER AGAIN) Artichoke Hummus with grilled naan bread and fire roasted vegetables. This was the only dish I enjoyed, but I was so annoyed and grossed out by the other dishes (particularly the oil-filled bite of bao) that I left most of it. Still, if I had to order anything again, I'd order this.\n\nWith one good food experience and one terrible food experience, I think a three star review is warranted. Gosh, I hope they rethink that arugula salad (or at least the description) and the fried pork bao buns.", "author": "Andi P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-22", "description": "Food is so good.

The restaurant was nearly empty when we ordered at around 7, and we were there for 2 hours.\n\nWe started with the 18 Month Aged Tennessee Ham with Japanese Milk Bread, Pickled Okra and Butter ($16). I was extremely sad when I realized that the \"Milk Bread\" is the exact same thing they give you as the complimentary bread to start. So after we got the complimentary bread and the House Flatbread ($14), 20 minutes later we got that same exact bread with a few slices of ham and pickles.\n\nMoving on, we then had the Braised Tofu Skins ($18), which were fine, and then noticed the table of 4 near us getting our entrees. The waitress asked if we wanted dessert, so they clearly forgot our burger, and rushed it in. The Dry Aged Burger ($23) happened to be excellent, but for the last issue, they brought it without the Steak Fries, which they said would be right out, but ended up arriving several minutes after we finished the burger.\n\nFinally, the desserts were pretty solid. We tried the Vanilla Cheesecake ($10), which was super creamy and nice and sweet, and the Chocolate Pretzel Torte ($10), which wasn't as good as the Pretzel Ice Cream it came with.\n\nMaybe breakfast is better, as the menu seems to have a number of sandwiches that sound great. I might return to try those. But I'd probably rather go to Wilma Jean next time I'm in this area of Brooklyn.", "author": "Mike C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-11", "description": "Flavortown downtown!

We live nearby and were a bit unsure given the place is new and has had mixed reviews thus far - but we are SO glad we decided to try it for ourselves.\n\nThe food was fantastic - fresh, tasty, and well seasoned. We had the roasted carrots \u0026 asparagus appetizer, the Po Boy sandwich, and the cheeseburger. All perfectly cooked and yummy. But to start, they brought out warm bread with warm butter, and this was a huge plus in our book; it's the way bread and butter should be served, and not nearly enough of the higher-end restaurants serve it this way.\n\nThe dessert was to die for; pie from the local (and award-winning) Four and Twenty Blackbirds. We barely had room in our bellies but this treat is not one to miss.\n\nVery attentive service from our server Johan and the rest of the staff. And the ambience was a relaxed elegant.\n\nThis lovely place will very soon be discovered by the neighborhood foodies who aren't daunted by hotel restaurants (it is tucked within the Hilton Downtown Brooklyn); those who are will be missing out.", "author": "Barbara G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-29", "description": "Gabriel, the bartender is super chill!
