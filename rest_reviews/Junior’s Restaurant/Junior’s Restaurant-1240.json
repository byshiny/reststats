The skin is golden and crispy and delicious. The filling is just sweet enough and smooth and luscious. \n\nThe service is spotty.

It wasn't THAT great.. Most definitely an experience to eat here. Had the Strawberry Cheesecake.. SUCH A GENEROUS SLICE, enough for two people.. I don't remember how it tastes..\n\nBUT I DO REMEMBER THE MATZAH BALL SOUP!!\nI had a cup and it came with one huge ball.. The soup was good, something gentle on my stomach after eating white castle at 2am the night before.. \n\nAmbiance is very old school, I loved it.. Our waiter was super nice..

This one definitely has more character than the one in in the Theater District, and also feels like its more of a neighborhood diner.\n\nI really like how this place still looks like its 1950 inside.

Since i was a little kid. 10 or 15 years back , the food was great! Everything cooked perfectly nice and juicy. But since then the place has really gone downhill. I order a burger it's dry, burnt and plain tasting. i order a Steak, it's dry burnt and plain-tasting. Even the pastries taste bad. Earlier this year I got an apple strudel and I bite into it and it's doughy, like uncooked dough and the apples feel like apples but taste like lemons! I could barely eat it!! \n\n\nThe only saving grace is the Cheesecake and Red Velvet cake is okay, but that's it. Maybe the new one in Times Square  is better.", "author": "Aaron S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-17", "description": "I thought that the cheesecake was really good.

I've been to Junior's a number of times and look forward to it whenever I go to New York!  Their cheesecake will make you want to slap yo mama (sorry mom).  Have never had a bad meal here.  It's part of the Brooklyn experience you HAVE to take in if your anywhere nearby.  Easy to reach to.  Flatbush \u0026 Delkalb.  Get off the train and look across the street.

The last time i was in their i was sitting in a booth and dropped my napkin on the floor. As i reached down to pick it up i glanced under my table and noticed their was a mouse glue trap.

It's right next to the DeKalb subway stops but be warned that the B train on the orange line doesn't run during the weekend. The best way to get there is to take the Q train on the yellow line. If you have to take the D train on the orange line, you'll end up at the Atlantic stop. It's not really that far to get to Juniors from there though.\n\nAs to the restaurant, it's in a fairly unremarkable neighbourhood, just the right side of grotty. The interior is really jolly and there is a lovely atmosphere. The servers all dress in sharp black uniforms and there is a real air of activity. It's a big place so you shouldn't have to queue for long, if at all.\n\nThe food is nice, if unlikely to change the world. I had a pulled pork sandwich. As I say, nothing revolutionary but it was REALLY tasty. The cheesecake was fantastic as advertised. I had the original and, for the price, it was worth it. The price of the main was high enough for what it was, but that's New York prices for you (even in Brooklyn).\n\nThe review almost lost a star due to the conduct of my server when it came to settling up. While she was polite, swift and capable, she suddenly became VERY attentive to my table both as I prepared to pay and after she brought me my change. She was obviously angling for a tip at that point. It was really quite awkward. Given the fact that she'd done a good job, I was of course going to leave her the standard 15%. Perhaps I looked like a cheapskate and, as a European, I have to say I find the American expectation of a gratuity as a matter of course to be rather strange.

A good deal less pricey than some hyped delis and the pastrami and corned beef are tasty tender and piled high enough to fill you up.  The desserts are great big old style bakery classics with the cheesecake a definite must try.  No this is not high end but its good basic food in a comfy classic retro 70's environment and staffed by friendly experienced waiters most of whom have many years on the job as evidenced by their easy going manner and skill.  Before you drop way too much for way too little remember that deli food is not and will never be gourmet/health or cutting edge so go to juniors and enjoy the extensive menu, fun surroundings big comfy tables with lots of pics of the famous and not so famous.", "author": "John L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-05", "description": "The fried chicken here is SO GOOD.

I might have to find a way to order one before I start obsessing about it. That, or I might have to make a trip to NY soon to see friends, and indulge.
