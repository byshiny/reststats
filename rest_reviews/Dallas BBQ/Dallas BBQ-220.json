Folks also come here for the selection of Texas-sized drinks, but I wished they had a better beer menu - they didn't even have Sam Adams, which other BBQs serve,\n\nThe food came quickly and was adequately prepared, our server was friendly, but we could tell had too many tables to tend - not her fault. It was tasty, a nice place to come to when you want to sit down for some humongous wings, huge drinks, or comfort food at a decent price. This location can get noisy, especially on Fridays and the weekend.", "author": "Leonard P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-17", "description": "Four stars  for customer service and fast food delivery.  The salmon spinach salad I got was fresh.  I usually go to Dallas BBQ for their fried wings but I  have been spoiled crazy by Korean style fried wings.  My server was sweet and attentive.  Families and large groups were having fun which made for a noisy space but this is what the franchise is all about. If I'm around downtown Brooklyn again this would be a cheap reliable grub stop.", "author": "Ireen N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-23", "description": "I went there with a good friend for dinner and drinks. The waiter was super nice and he gave us extra shots in our Texas size blue Hawaiians.\nI ordered the steak, shrimp and ribs combo it came with french fries and corn bread. I only got to eat half cause I was to full. LOL \nThe steak is gross. It was over cooked when I clearly stated medium well. It was super nasty never again. \n\nOh and forget about the surroundings . super ghetto people. The couple in front of us were arguing from the moment I got there until the moment we left. The guy called his girl a SL*T and  was talking to her like she was a man. OMG GHETTO.

I eat here a lot when I need to have my stomach full. I place items for lunch and then pick it up. My suggestion if you call in your order always double check it before leaving. I was impressed at how I could place my order, have it read back to me and still they got it wrong when I arrived to pick up. Also they will try to slip you a diet coke or Lipton ice tea with your order. Who wants either of those not me. Anyway the food can be a hit or miss. Stay away from the fish it has no flavor. The sticky wings are good and the drinks are ok. It can get loud and very crowded. The servers are ok some are shady and will try to add items you didn't order, so check your bill closely.", "author": "Tracy P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-30", "description": "Me and my boyfriend went to this BBQs the other day. We got seated right away but waiting for the waitress to come and take at least the drink order was a wait, about 10+ minutes before someone came over. Thats the only complaint I have. It was also pretty packed and it was a wednesday. Other than that, the food was GREAT, Margaritas were the BEST and our waitress,  Rochelle was really nice. She wasnt like those annoying waitresses that breathe on top of you every 5 minutes. She was good.

The sirloin steak is pretty good too. It's well-seasoned and tastes even better with bbq sauce. The service is relatively quick considering the size of the crowd and the food portions are huge. \n\nThe Bad: I do not care for the ribs here. It tastes bland to me. \n\nThe Ugly: Rarely, the patrons act as if they have no hometraining but I do not let that ruin my meal.\n\nSidenote: Once in a while, I see a random cute kid walking around with a rib in one hand and a toy in the other.

The wings were huge and delicious.  I don't even like frozen drinks but since it was all they had I tried the pineapple rush. It was amazing!  There was a honey mustard sauce that was so good.

I went with a party of 6. The waiter was very pleasant, she constantly checked up on us and asked us if everything was ok and if we needed anything. The food is good. I enjoyed my double cheeseburger with fries, and it was so huge I couldn't finish. I also got a Texas sized raspberry pi\u00f1a colada and it was also huge, I shared it with a friend. They have virgin and with alcohol. You could also add any favors you want. They have a decent selection to add to it for flavor. The prices are great. All in all it was good. But the only downsides are that there is no dessert menu at all, they give you free mini cupcakes after your meal as dessert; btw those cupcakes were extremely cold and the frosting didn't even move it was basically frozen. There was a time when we needed our waiter to add something to the order and she was nowhere to be found but then we asked another waiter and they said they couldn't attend us, but then again they also didn't help us find our waiter, so we were just sitting there waiting for our waiter to come back around. Also, it was extremely noisy, I had to speak louder than usual to get the people right on the other side of the same table as me to hear what I was saying. Other than that I enjoyed my time there and I would definitely make another visit for that delicious pi\u00f1a colada :)", "author": "Raslin E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-13", "description": "When I was growing up, my family and I frequented BBQ's regularly. And that was back when there were only like two locations in all of New York City and they made a really good rotisserie chicken.\nBut over the years, BBQ's has turned into a chain with locations all over NYC. And as time went on and more locations opened up, quality went down. \nThis location in particular is stunning. It appears it was some kind of ballroom before it became a chicken and rib franchise. \nBut, this place is ALWAYS crowded, thanks, in part to Brooklyn Tabernacle a few doors down. \nWho doesnt love that early bird special? two meals for $9.99. \nThe service is rushed. The food is mass produced and the staff arent the friendliest. The real kick in the face was the bright red sticker on my receipt telling me tip was not included as well as the waitress telling me that the total did not include a tip for her services. \nWow.\nIs it THAT bad here that staff are getting stiffed? \nThat wasnt even the big deal, the big deal came when i left her 18%, which was generous despite being ignored the entire time, but when she read the receipt in front of me and said I didnt leave a tip. \n\"Thats because Im leaving a cash tip.\" The part where it says TIP: read CASH. W. T. F. \nServes me right... the food is nothing to write home about, but my family loves it here.", "author": "Monique R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-24", "description": "Myself and a group of close friends and family visited Dallas Bbq's at Broadway Junction in Brooklyn yesterday.
