Now my friend did arrive late and that really did irritate the heck out of me. So when she came we were seated in the booth near the street. Our server was Tyshawn. I'm just going to say one thing, Tyshawn is nothing short of a sweetheart. I would never forget him because his service was nothing less than 100%. He went above and beyond for my friend and I. I mean damn, when you have a great server, you'll always remember them. I had to tip him 30% because he was that good.\n\nSo I give Junior's a 5 star rating based off of that. I mainly know them for their cheesecakes not their food. Their food is very, very good.\n\nSo the only thing lacking is their drink selection. They will make any cocktail you want but you'll have to ask. I really wished I had a choice but it was okay. I had a Sex on the Beach that was quite good. Strong but sweet.\n\nSo I did not want to eat much, but my friend is a pescatarian and ordered the Fried Calamari. It was very good. I tried one piece and sure did like it. I ordered the Thai ginger wings as well as the Coconut Rice and Beans. The wings were excellent and that was the best rice and peas dish I have ever tasted. The rice had flavor and was not dry. It was that addictive. We were also given cornbread prior to eating out food. It was moist and tasted good with the sweet cream butter. Our server also gave us free soda and routinely came around to check on us.\n\nWe stayed at the restaurant for a few hours talking and Tyshawn came to us with a bag each with onion rolls, cornbread and pickles. That was pretty nice of him.\n\nWould I come back? Yes. Ask for Tyshawn. He is the best. The food is excellent too.", "author": "Omolara O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-04-18", "description": "Finally got a chance to try this place. Lived in Brooklyn my whole life always wanted to try but never had time or could find parking. Went with my family for the half pastrami and corn beef sandwich. Super super dry I literally almost used the whole bottle of mustard on the table to eat it. Wife got the pastrami with mozzarella. Same thing super dry as if it was old from the day before possible. Kids had chicken sandwich same problem super dry white meat. Other kid got the chicken tenders surprisingly that was the only thing that wasn't dry. As for the cheesecake I must admit was creamy and good but not all that great. Would rather eat the frozen one from bjs or the supermarket. Even Cheesecake Factory might of been better. Bill came out or over $160. The cool thing about the experience is the inside is original old lookong. It was cool. Atleast I can say we tried it.", "author": "Benny B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-27", "description": "Place looks like a Brooklyn staple. Food was mediocre. I believe they're known for their pies though. Service was very good and the lady was super lovely! It's a nice family place, which does include a loud atmosphere.

The place was filled with folks who were on a first-name basis with the staff.  We traveled here (as tourists) based on the travel channel suggestion.  The food and desserts are great here at the original location and I imagine they are likely just as good at the Times Square location too.

Come for the the namesake cheesecake. The rest of the food is meh, but you'll get your quantity for it.\n\nLook out for the random gratuity they'll tack onto your bill.

I normally get breakfast every visit and this time I ordered a cheese omelette with fries. It was good for the most part. \n  The service was okay until I went to get some cake slices. It's really not clear as to which cashier is open or not and the workers aren't that helpful either. I stood in one line while a guy and the cashier held a 5-10 min conversation and when he left the line, I thought I was next, he never came back. Never said go to the other side when a crowd of people came and the other cashier took them first although he saw me waiting. \n   Things like this is the reason we normally do takeout. Next time, if there is one I will do so.", "author": "Tiffany J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-15", "description": "Junior's makes an excellent strawberry cheesecake and dare I say an even better pineapple coconut cake.

While I've never ventured away from the cheesecakes, the menu is so expansive that there's almost certainly SOMETHING for everyone in your group.  The standard NY Cheesecake is always a winner, but if you're feeling more adventurous, see what's on special.

Firstly, they are excellent in false advertising: on FB and other social platforms they promoted the strawberry shortcake for $5, but upon payment it turned out that it's almost $9 with tax as the other price is for dine-in only in case you also buy another dish... obviously no response for them. The cake itself is horrible, too sweet and it's just a ton of whipped cream, we couldn't even finish it. We tried other cheesecakes as well at Juniors, none of them was even close to a real cheesecake. They are too expensive and don't taste good at all. The carrot cake we also bought went wrong after 1 day!! We ate the half of it then it was in the fridge the whole time and it had a funny taste the next day so I threw it out. The only thing I like in that restaurant is the devil's chocolate cake.", "author": "Alexandra D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-20", "description": "I had heard really good things about Junior's but it was just okay.

Just another tourist spot. Personally, I'm against chain restaurants and diners. I feel like because of the dirt cheap prices you sacrifice on quality food. \n\nMe and my friend wanted dessert and this was the closest in the area (I was not walking around in the cold.) We weren't getting anything but dessert. There's a massive selection of cakes to pick from. I went with the German chocolate slice with a scoop of coffee ice cream. You know what I got? I got a BOWL. WITH A MASSIVE PORTION OF CAKE. My jaw literally fell open as the waitress brought it to our table. As always my friend finished her slice while I didn't (terrible foodie.) \n\nI have nothing against the restaurant.

But she was so nice and joyful! We went after a heavy dinner so didn't have room for much.

We went with the pie and were happy about our choice. Real big juicy strawberries on top and enough strawberry sauce for each bite of cheesecake! Service was fast and entire staff was great.
