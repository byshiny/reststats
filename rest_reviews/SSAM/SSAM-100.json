We were waiting for a friend and didn't want to order first. But even after we told the waiter about this, they still come back one minutes later and ask if we want to order now. We said we were waiting for a friend, but they come back in one minute again. This happens 4 times before our friend came.\nAfter they served the food, they keep coming back to check, but the way they check is really rude. They wander behind you, and you feel like someone is behind you, but suddenly they go away.\nThe stone bowl is way too hot that all the onions are charred. Food taste so-so too. I'm not coming back.", "author": "Kai-han C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-16", "description": "This is an amazing Asian restaurant, and better than anything at home.

Place was empty when we arrived but it started to pick up at the end of our meal. \nWe ordered two spicy chicken bibimbap, a plate of boneless wings and the sliders. The Bibimbap was good, served in a heated stone bowl. It arrives at the table sizzling.  My only concern is that it came with straight up gochujang sauce instead of the more traditional sauce that has sesame oil and vinegar mixed into the gochujang.  A little disappointed about that.  Otherwise, we were very happy with our meal and glad to have a good bibimbap place in the neighborhood.  \nStaff was nice. Ambiance is good. \nDefinitely will be back.", "author": "J L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-05", "description": "Was really craving Korean fried chicken but didn't want to travel to ktown, east village, flushing or bayside... so came here since it was close to my house. I was actually quite surprised there was a Korean restaurant here and yelped to see its reviews. There seemed to mixed reviews but I decided to try it anyway. The decor of this restaurant is pretty cool but couple of things I noticed that weren't so great 1- all the chairs are torn (they have pleather seats and the pleather were all torn and in pieces making it really difficult to sit) 2- we sat at a table where there was a hot water pipe right next to it, my husband get burned on his leg. The food is really mediocre- the wings were ok, there was no authentic banchan (Korean small dishes) - they only served stale kimchi. The ramen we got was blander than if I cooked my own Shin ramen (which after eating here and paying $16 for a bowl, I really wanted to go home and do that). They also played top 40s Latin music all\nNight... like it was a club... anyway this place is not a authentic Korean restaurant... the food is nothing to rave about... and next time I will definitely make the effort to travel to a authentic Korean restaurant.", "author": "Susan P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-21", "description": "Legit Korean food.

Definitely my favorite Korean chicken wings I've found and better than anything in Ktown! Our other dishes - salmon bibimbap and squid \u0026 pork plate - were super on point! \n\nThe manager was very kind and provided great service. The atmosphere is cute cozy, and on trend. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes and most importantly, eat their chicken wings again!", "author": "Courtney C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-12-16", "description": "First, there was nobody at the entrance to greet us. My party and I had to awkwardly wander into the restaurant to flag down somebody in order to be seated. The food was pretty much forgettable. Haemool pajeon was cooked unevenly (which you can clearly see in my photo) and barely had any seafood in it. Kalbi dolsot bibimbap and haemool sundubu were pretty flavorless and not well executed. While trying to pay, the waitress took our check, placed it next to the cashier, and proceeded to complete  multiple other tasks. I had to walk up to the cashier in order to remind her to run my card.

Absolutely delicious - great flavors. The Galbi Dolsot so hit the spot, the meat was super flavorful and just perfectly tender. Salmon Dolsot was also quite good, and I loved the sweet and savory flavors of the Ddukbaegi Bulgogi. Glad we tried it, even though hubby was a bit upset about having an egg in his dish after he ordered it without the egg - minor hiccup, as was the bottle of Guinness that was supposed to be draft (he did get over it).", "author": "Tatyana R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-20", "description": "Nice hangout with friends.

The food is great, and reasonably priced. Ive had the kimchi cheese fries (unfortunately so good we ate them all), dumplings, bibimbop, noodles and a kimchi pancake. The pancake is the only thing I might skip because it was a bit greasy, everything else was bomb.", "author": "Alison K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-26", "description": "This is quite a great Korean restaurant!

It's chill, great music, you get a seat fast, and the food is delicious.  I usually go with the lunch selections and get the kimchi fried rice with chicken wings.
