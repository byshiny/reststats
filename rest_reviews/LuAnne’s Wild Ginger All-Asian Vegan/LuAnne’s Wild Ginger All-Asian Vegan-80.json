You can't go wrong with anything here!\n\nThe service was great, the food delicious and good size portions. When in the area, I'll be back.

However the woman working at the desk was extremely rude and unprofessional. When I walked in I asked her where to order- she said right there at the desk. Without asking me if I'm going to stay or take out, she hands me my food in a bag. I told her I'm staying. She got extremely nasty and slammed my food on the table and started to open my bag. I grabbed my food back and left. She yelled and threw her hands up basically telling me to leave. So if you want your money appreciated and good service DONT GO HERE", "author": "Sarah L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-16", "description": "We did an impromptu lunch here one day because the place we originally went to had too much meat (my lunch partner is a vegetarian). \n\nHe ordered the black pepper seitan and I had the eggplant basil with greenbeans.... it comes with a salad or miso soup (we had the salad - the dressing was a bit grainy, but tasty) and the main dish comes with a little veggie egg roll.\n\nEverything was phenomenal and I can't praise the food enough! The only catch was that service after we got our food was a bit slow(er) - we should have mentioned we were in a rush since we had quite a walk back to the office.", "author": "Heather H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-21", "description": "Vegan options, while there are making headway, they are still small players, especially in NYC, and even still, very lacking in the outer boroughs.

The veggie dumplings, Mekong bowl, and japchae stand out as my favorites, but like I said, I've enjoyed every dish. The delivery is also very reasonable--my food always arrives within 30 minutes.

I loved every single bit of my food but the mango sushi rolls were heavenly! I also ordered the scallion pancakes which were surprisingly sweeter than I expected but still very good. \n\nThe interior was dark and low-lit...perfect for a date night with the girl-friend from work. :-) The service was super...the waitress was respectful, attentive, and patient with my friend's food allergy requests. \n\nIf you are planning to try a desert, you must try the pumpkin cheesecake before the menu changes for the season!

Everything on the menu is vegan, so order away! Service is super friendly, food comes quickly, and ambiance is calm and relaxing. \n\nCurry Samosas $6.50: (6 pieces) Crispy, flaky, and delicious!

One of the best vegan restaurants in Brooklyn. My wife and I took our daughter in law who's a non vegan and our 2 year old grandson out to dinner at Wild Ginger and they loved it!!!

The service is great, the restaurant itself is cute and small, and the food is great. You've got so many options to choose, and I like how they incorporate other Asian cultures like Korean and even a bit of Indian, which I normally don't see in Asian Fusion restaurants. Also, it's all vegan, which is great! For my first time, I had mango soy protein with miso soup. So flavorful and it didn't even feel like I was eating soy. The \"meat\" is pretty accurate, which is creepy but cool. My second time, I had Jap Chae, which also had lots of flavor, and I love noodles. I would totally go back again to try more dishes.", "author": "Sophie T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-05", "description": "This is my favorite vegan asian spot, the food is so tasteful and the serving size it just right for your buck.

Went to lunch on a nice afternoon. About a 15-20 minute walk from work but worth it. Picked out what I wanted to get (Malaysian Curry and the Peanut butter bomb) before I got there.

Restaurant is very pretty with great atmosphere. Service was okay.\n\nThe food is great and menu is huge so you will always want to come back to try something else. The steamed spinach shumai dumplings are excellent while the scallion pancake was not very good. There was no taste of scallion, the portion was small and it tasted simply like fried dough.\n\nThe bibimbap is amazingly tasty, though. A big bowl of coconut rice topped with a variety of seaweeds, tofu, avocado, chickpeas and sauces. Fantastic and it comes with a cup of great pumpkin soup. A ton of food for $15. I enjoyed it and like leaving full but healthy.", "author": "Sol C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-08", "description": "_ PUMPKIN SOUP\nClear soup, not pureed, with cubes of pumpkin and a tiny sprinkling of cilantro.\nTasty, not salty = good!

There weren't many other diners, and I was served by two members of the staff.\n\nI ordered steamed vegetable dumplings, which were tasty but not superlative. After that I had the black pepper seitan, which was delicious. The greens underneath were good but a little too al dente. The brown rice on the side had some soft beans, which was a pleasant surprise. My drink was oolong tea served in the most adorable little pot, and they kindly refilled my hot water. For dessert I had the MONSTER chocolate peanut butter bundt cake which I SOMEHOW managed to finish!\n\nOverall, my items arrived in a timely manner, and the staff was friendly and accommodating without being intrusive.
