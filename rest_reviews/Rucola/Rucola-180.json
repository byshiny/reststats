None of the dishes were particularly exciting or innovative however and some dishes verged on being downright boring (fusilli with kale and walnut pesto. The antipasti was maybe the only thing that was below average due in large part to a selection of vegetables that left a lot to be desired and a yellowish sauce that verged on offensiveness in both flavor and appearance.  \n      Service is the definition of spotty,  with some of the servers displaying warmth and professionalism, and others demonstrating that particular brand of eye rolling condescension that all too often helps give Brooklyn  a douchy bad name. \n    The room was very nice, and the place is well served by the quiet classic charm of its location in this mostly residential stretch of Brownstoneland once known as South Brooklyn.\nThe biggest problem with this place is unquestionably the minuscule portion sizes that certainly didn't justify the prices.  $14 for the tiny plate of the above mentioned fusilli, and the two puny skewers, maybe holding two inches of meat with the spiedini are par for the course here.  I don't think I will be rushing back, particularly if I am the one paying.", "author": "Brendan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-01", "description": "GREAT customer service! The menu isn't bad either!\n\nWent here for brunch on a Sunday around 1pm. Pretty busy but we didn't have a wait at all. I will say the brunch menu is a bit limited for my taste but I ordered the bacon/egg/cheese sandwich w/ arugula. Not bad! \n\nThey brew stumptown too -- awesome! \n\nThe vibe/ambiance is really great and I think this is a great after work/date spot. No doubt a much more extensive menu for dinner.\n\nThey accept CCs! Yay!\n\nI will definitely be back during the week to try the PM fare.", "author": "jaclyn g."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-09", "description": "This review is way overdue, because we went to Rucola back in November, but luckily I still remember how much we enjoyed brunch! The best part? The sweet potato gratin. I realize that sounds weird - and we weren't sure what to expect, but we could've just gotten 5 of these and eaten them and been happy. The sweet potatoes are cooked perfectly (with tons of butter) and spiced very well. I can't do it justice by describing it, but just know that you should try it. We also got the bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, with the bacon on the side (because my boyfriend doesn't eat it). The sandwich was very good, but the bacon is definitely the best part :) For the sweet part of the meal, we got the nutella french toast. The portion wasn't as big as I would have liked, but how can you go wrong with nutella french toast? The chopped hazelnuts are a unique touch -- I recommend it!\n\nThe atmosphere was perfect - and exactly what we expected in Brooklyn :) We sat at the end of a long, communal table. Everyone was friendly and laid back. The light fixtures and wood tables were great. I definitely recommend Rucola for brunch - I'd go all the time if I lived nearby!", "author": "Jess G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-15", "description": "Great place for groups as they take reservation for parties over 5 people.  9 if us went there for a birthday party.

We attempted to eat here on a recent Saturday night, knowing that it gets crowded and thus we arrived at 6:30. I expected there might be some wait, but I was excited when I walked in and saw a couple of open tables. Given that their website clearly states that they do NOT take reservations for parties of less than 5 people, I got my hopes up only to have them dashed by the host who informed us that we'd have a 2 hour wait! Wait a minute....I asked....there was no line and I spotted a couple of open tables. Oh, those people called ahead to get a table, the host told me. Apparently, one can call in advance and make a quasi-reservation, even though their website states a no reservation policy. What?? \n\nPlace looked cozy and I am sure the food is delish. Maybe some day I'll learn the inside secret to enable dining there. For now, I am turned off by their game playing. Either take reservations or not, and please be clear about it on your website. Don't use this system for some folks, but not others.  I suspect they think the secret to being popular is to turn people away in some sort of hard-to-get fashion. I played those games in high school . Not interested now.", "author": "Alex S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-18", "description": "Really loved this place!  Went this evening for dinner with a handful of friends -- all agreed that it was exceptional!   Loved the fresh, interesting cocktails to start, and great \"chef's choice\" antipasto platter to share.  Entrees were terrific: Arctic char, flanksteak and several of the homemade pastas.  Everything delicious, authentic.  Service was very friendly and attentive. Ambience just right.  Will definitely go back.

I've gone once in a huge group (we sat at the center table), and a couple times with one other person. It is such a nice place.

Went there on Sunday and met there with friends who had been there or a while, just having cocktails and beers waiting for the kitchen to open.  The staff was very attentive and accommodating and I really enjoyed the rustic decor.\n\nThe cocktails were delicious and we ordered some food to share.  Twice we ordered the Chef's Selection (yes, it was that good!) and it was different each time, and delicious both times. Loved the olives and the beets and the cheeses went really well with my Rose (and my friends' cocktails).  We also ordered the two pasta dishes which were outstanding.\n\nIt got really crowded just after the kitchen opened, so I can see that there might be a wait and I would say it was a bit loud.", "author": "Carolina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-11", "description": "Time to add Rucola, a wonderful little restaurant hidden away (but extremely popular) in Brooklyn Heights, to my list of favorite Italian restaurants.\n\nThe wait for a table was over two hours long but we were lucky and got bar seats much quicker.  To be honest, I preferred the bar over a table - it's a much more intimate experience with the restaurant staff and those you're dining with. \n\nAlmost everything was notable.  Deliciously marinated mushrooms, thin slices of hot coppa and a surprisingly affordable quartino of very decent red wine (we had the \"Ceregio\" 2011 Sangiovese for $14).\n\nThe highlight for me were the two pasta entrees.  Shells (Fall squash pure\u00e8, broccoli rabe, Pecorino Romano, black pepper, $15) and Tagliatelli (Veal breast rag\u00f9, tomato, Grana Padano, $16) both cooked to a perfect al dente and with wonderful, rich, but not overpowering sauce.\n\nThe Bourbon Pear Crumble ($6) from a famous Brooklyn pie shop called Four \u0026 Twenty Blackbirds with a side of whipped cream was an outstanding finish.\n\nNo question - I'm coming back.", "author": "Adrian K."}], "servesCuisine": "Italian", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Rucola", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "190 Dean St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ea87R47Kp_k95_fE7ginIA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185763209"}
