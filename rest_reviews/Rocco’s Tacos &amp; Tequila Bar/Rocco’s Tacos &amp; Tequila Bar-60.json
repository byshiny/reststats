Some of the staff were rude and cold, our server however, was pretty friendly. Maybe a little too friendly to the point of awkwardness, she mixed up my friend a drink and waited enthusiastically for his reaction even though he didn't really care about it--a drinks a drink ya' know. Food was ehh, the first batch of chips were stale, the seasoned ones were pretty good...but I don't see myself coming here again.", "author": "Hoda A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-18", "description": "Jen the hostess forgot to put our name down after 45 minutes of waiting!!\nwe arrived at 7:40 and they finally found us a table at 9:05. When we arrived, they wrote down on paper our name, number, and told us that they would call but it should be around 40 minutes. By 45 minutes we asked them if our table was ready and the hostess proceeded to look at her list and, though she did not explicitly say it, she acted as if we were not in the list. Despite this, told us that a table would be ready shortly.  They then told us that they did not forget to put our name in the list, but minutes later told us that there were many hostesses and names were getting mixed up. In addition, she told us the table would be ready in five minutes. After saying 4 more times it will be five minutes, they told us that our table was finally ready. 1 1/2 hours later.  40 extra minutes from when the table should have been ready.  I get that some people may say \"oh well a lot of restaurants take some time\" but lying repeatedly is wrong. In conclusion, they not only took an hour and a half to get us a table, but lied repeatedly about the wait and our name being on the list.", "author": "M F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-10", "description": "Went here for lunch on Monday.

I'm from Florida so I usually go to the Orlando location. This was the worst experience I've had at one of these restaurants at this location. Came with my family on a family vacation, 7 of us, so we didn't mind waiting for a table. However once seated it took about 20 minutes for someone to greet us and take a drink order. Mean while the table next to us was extremely loud and rude. We literally couldn't hear each other right next to each other. Our waitress never came by so we had to find someone to complain to. They moved us to another location but then we had to wait another 20 minutes to finally get some drinks. \n\nOnce the drinks were finally delivered the waiter said he would be back to take our dinner order. After about another 20 minutes of waiting we were ready to walk out when another new waiter came by. He gave us a free pitcher of margaritas to make up for the horrible, up until that point, evening. From then on it was great service. Really rough start but ended better thus the 3 Stars.", "author": "Emily M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-03-16", "description": "Plus: staying next door, able to get on the wait list, go back to our hotel \u0026 be summoned by text when our table was ready.

The last two times she was our waitress and it was awfully annoying. I brought visitors from Miami, and I didn't tell them that I had a previous bad experience with that waitress, but they told me how inexperienced and unqualified she was while we were there.\n\nShe messed up our orders, never brought their drinks. Took forever to brink the check and never offer a dessert menu. Most importantly, never apologized.\n\nI would say that the food was good. Even though I asked her to bring my sauces on the side and apparently she never informed the kitchen because all the sauce was on top of my burrito and it was SO spicy ( I don't eat spicy food) I told her and she didn't even try to resolve the issue. So I basically didn't eat it, didn't take it home, and paid for it anyway.\n\nI don't want her to lose her job because of a \"whiny annoying yelper\" (I bet that's what she is going to think) but I believe this platform is more about helping the restaurants and places to improve their service and have a better customer experience. Maybe she can use an extra training and a workshop to handle orders and her own attitude towards the customers, which in this industry \"are always right.\"", "author": "Wendrich J.

I came here with my gf on a rainy Sunday, and the place was pretty empty. The decor is very interesting, almost like a latin \"celebration of the dead\" vibe - very colorful with decorated and happy skeletons, and really cool lights and other other items.\n\nOur server was great, and ask for the guac! They actually make it in a pestle for you fresh, tableside. The chips and guac were awesome. Next week had the fish tacos and the Durango platter. The platter was very tasty and filling, the meat combos were cooked perfectly. The fish taco was unique and good, but the fish was strongly \"fishy\". I would have preferred a variety with a lighter fish taste.\n\nThe atmosphere was loud at times despite the few patrons, as some were enjoying the bar quite enthusiastically - but kind of the norm for a tequila bar. The service was kind and attentive.", "author": "Kevin M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-01-13", "description": "Went here for a birthday party!

Really enjoy this place. Love historical like decor options - check out the bathrooms!  Staff is super friendly (shout out to Bella as server and Mike at the bar), food is soo well seasoned (no lack of flavor here), guacamole made to order at the table, and comes served with seasoned chips. I've had a few meals here and I think you can't go wrong with a quesadillas or the tacos (I like the beef on a crispy corn shell), but other options are a plus too! Order up... Drink time!!...  i really enjoy a spicy guava margarita; if your looking for fun spicy cocktail, but every drink made by Mike has been yummy!  Dessert?...  off the bat- Tres Leche !!  \"It was milky, creamy, and delicious...\"\nEnjoy guys... give this place a go, think you'll enjoy if around the way.

Chandeliers everywhere and other one-light fixtures hung from the ceiling. It's dimly-lit and buzzing with energy. Spacious venue. There's the usual level of noise, but can be a nice date place. Great place to have drinks and or eats.\n\nI ordered a blackened fish and a grilled fish tacos. Both were not hot when waitress brought it to my table. Classic margarita was light on alcohol. I decided to eat and drink them 'as is'. The Tres Leches Cake was like others I've eaten. I wished the meringue-like topping was real whipped cream. Even so, I cleaned dessert off that plate.\n\nThere's booth seating and regular table seating. Bathroom downstairs.
