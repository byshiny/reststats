Today I was yelled at and  cursed at by a man sitting outside of the bar.   I went in to speak to a manager and I was told by the bartender the yelling man is regular and is known to harass  people, she apologized. This is a neighborhood bar and they need to put more effort to keep the neighborhood safe, I wasnt even in the bar just walking by.  \n\nDo not go to this bar unless you want to be harassed, the bar will not protect you .", "author": "Tessa H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-11", "description": "I used to dig this place back in 2011 but I'm bored of it now. With all due respect to the 90s, it is dead and gone already. Yet, for whatever reason, the DJs here insist on playing old school hip-hop for majority of the night. Ugh! Like dude, can we come back to the present even for a few minutes? I was waiting for some turn up music or NEW dancehall/soca music to be played at least once and it didn't happen. I guess it is understandable because the crowd is in mainly their 30s to 40s (from what I see anyway). However, there are twenty-somethings who come to this spot and we like to hear more updated music. I find this happens a lot in many of the lounges around this neighborhood as well as the Clinton Hill/Bed Stuy area btw. Like, no...I don't want to hear Mary J. Blige or Biggie on the dance floor AGAIN. Just because of that Mo's gets three stars revoked lol.", "author": "Amber A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-07", "description": "This is a solid local bar. The DJ playing is usually pretty good. The drinks are fairly priced, especially since the area is  \"changing\" so much. \n\nThe bartenders are very attentive and there's a nicely mixed crowed. \n\n*VERY IMPORTANT* - Cash Only! \n\nNice spot to go when you want to go out but don't want to REALLY go out.

This was the first time in 2 complete years that I visited. I was in school and focused. Now I'm a graduate with a job.\n\nFirst of all, that light skinned HOODLUM with the crew cut has to go. How do you tell people you can come unless you get a drink, then you get the drink, then he says the list closed, and then he lets some dudes in with bucket fitted and a sideways hat on the low. \n\nMy experience was memorable before.

I've been going there for a little over 4 years now, and since the management has changed DON'T EXPECT TO EAT BEFORE YOU DRINK BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SELL FOOD OR APPETIZERS ANYMORE!

Another pretentious bar with RUDE and NASTY bartenders. You're not doing me a favor by pouring me a beer. I'm doing YOU a favor by paying $6 for a beer that cost $1.75 at the deli. \n\nCame here on a Saturday night. Approached the bar. The bartender, a female, saw that I was waiting for a drink. Rather than greet me or say \"What can I get for you?\", she just glared at me as if to say \"Well?\". I ordered a drink and tried to pay with credit. \"Cash only\" she says, apathetically. So I walked out. Last time I'll be coming back. Don't need the attitude, and I will go to another bar and spend as much as I want with my credit card.

When we first walked up there was a line which was nonsense. I can tell the neighborhood locals go here weekly or just  those like me and my friend who needed a night out. It was packed on the main floor part  by the bar, extremely tight. We went up the stairs and it had a loung vibe. People were standing up but the good thing about it is they have seats around the wall area. The dj was playing the latest hip hop when we first walked in and after a while I was over it. He then went into some r and b, reggae, old school hip hop, a little bit of everything, he had a good blend. I would recommend a friday night here for sure. The drinks were watered down though. Non the less if your looking for a friday night out with friends or just your boo this is a good spot to come chill have a drink and relax. The crowd is mature but not old I'm 36 and I waa happy.

It wasn't quite packed yet, which I was pleasantly surprised about because I've been here before and I know it can get crazy. \n\nWe went to walk upstairs but the security guard stopped us and said we had to have drinks to sit there. I was surprised since I've never been told that before and I asked \"wow since when?!\" He said \"since now!\" Wrong answer. \n\nWe just wanted to grab a seat then come back to the bar to order drinks but after that we just decided to get club sodas. As we were waiting to order at the bar we saw several people go up the stairs without drinks.\nThe club sodas came pretty fast but they charged us $3 each! I've never heard of any bar charging for club soda from the soda gun...ever!\n\nWe took the \"drinks\" upstairs and more of our friends came. After awhile another security guard asked us to move seats because he wanted to put our chairs outside. Odd, but no problem since there were plenty of seats. We stayed awhile, our friends bought real drinks and danced a little (the music was good but they were the only ones dancing). \n\nWhen we went to leave we tried to go out of the side door that said \"exit only\" we were blocked and told we had to go out of the front. Which means we had to squeeze past all of the people in the front section, that just irked me. \n\n2 stars because there aren't any lounges in the area and the bartenders are fast. Minus 3 stars for insane VIP-esque sections, rude staff, and charging for carbonated water.", "author": "Renee H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-27", "description": "MO's is typically a go to neighborhood dive bar.  I'm here right now actually, but good lawd who's the waitress with the red hair???? This chick sucks!!!!!! First she's too busy dancing and twerking to service the customers.  Then she gets our order after we chased her down only to forget us and almost walk away with my friends drink still on the tray.  Is she drunk?!?!  Then we place another order.  This chick walks away and never comes back.  Finally she comes back empty handed and asked us if we were OK.  Umm where the fukk are our drinks?!!! I swear she's drunk...  wtf I gave her my credit card and I'm scared.

It is one of those bars where you can mingle and socialize. No, food but you can have take-out delivered. They also have a folder of take-out menus if you need it. It can get a bit loud, but the music is mainly hip-hop and r\u0026b. Waitresses continuously walk around and take your order. No long line at the bar because of it. Bathroom a bit small, and unclean.

This is not for the claustrophobic.\n\nThey really do pack as many people as they can into this small space. Don't be surprised if you get a drink spilled on you, or get yelled at for standing in front of the waitress station (even when there's nowhere else to stand)\n\nThe plusses are that the bouncer was nice and colloquial. From our brief interaction I feel he really wanted me to have a good time. And the beer was a typical 6 dollars, which isn't bad by NYC standards. I was happy to not be paying $9 for a Corona.\n\nI forgot to mention, if you're a guy, don't go looking to find yourself a piece.

We started off at Mullane's to watch the playoff games last weekend but it was too got dang packed.  49er fans were out in full force.

I got the $6 martini special and some wings and that's all I remember. Then I woke up in bed.  \n\nGood place to catch a game or relax with friends.  The back seating is perfect for groups.
