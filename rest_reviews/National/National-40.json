I am sad to let it go. \n\nTheir quality and flavor has exponentially decreased (read: jumbo shrimp has been replaced with minute shrimp that can barely be seen). The food is rarely spicy even if you ask for it spicy. They skimp on vegetables and protein and overdo the noodles, rice, green peppers, and especially onions. \n\nThey were amazing when they opened a few years ago. I added a star for nostalgia. I will have pings of memories of their yesteryear when I find my new local Thai spot.", "author": "Fazeela S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-03", "description": "As it's more conveniently located to my residence than Joya is, I've been coming to National for years. It's a straight shot to Atlantic and then a two blocks away. Never had a bad time here until yesterday....\n\nThis place used to be better. It is a great spot for a quick date night, as the food is delicious (per Joya standard), but the service last night was where i deducted stars. We were seated, put in our drink orders and had to wait about 10-15 mins for them to come to come to the table. It's like we were forgotten. The place wasn't that busy, so it's not like there was a reason for this. Joya is bigger and was busier on the Friday night that i went, and the service was still better.\n\nThe food was great as always, but i can't stand unnecessarily slow service. I'll probably stick to takeout since this is one of the better Thai options near me.", "author": "Karsten V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-08", "description": "Stopped by for lunch for 3 on a weekday\nNo reservations and we're seated immediately \nPretty empty by 2pm \nI was starving and excited for some Thai food.\nThe lady who served us is Thai (from her accent) but unfortunately the food was not authentic. At all.\n\nI ordered a lunch set that came with:\n\n- starter - choose between a few options (house salad, mango salad, soup) and I chose the tom yum soup\n- main - vegetarian pad see eow\n\nThe tom yum was sad. A sight of onion slices and mushrooms swimming in oil speckled broth.\nNon spicy, unsavory broth that was bland and unappetizing. No zing of lime, no lemon grass flavor. Mushrooms in the soup were undercooked.. \nperhaps this was toned down for the American palate, I thought. \n\nThe pad see eow was a monumental fail.\nNothing reminiscent of those in Thailand or even rest of NYC! It was more like thick rice noodles fried with Asian black sweet sauce. Zero flavor, super oily. \n\nThe upsides (thus 2 stars) were that my noodles had quite a lot of tofu pieces and the price was pretty reasonable for a starter and main for lunch. \nService was also prompt and nice but... \nOtherwise, never again ):", "author": "Jolene H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-28", "description": "National is one my favorite Thai restaurants. If you walk too fast down the street, you might miss it and it's easily a hidden gem. Every meal I've had here has been great and they always have plenty of options and specials to choose from. I normally skip out on dessert here but I recently tried the fried ice cream and it was a hit with my friends.

I've been here a few times, and have never been satisfied. The service is good and the ambiance is nice. But the food is always too salty and just not tasty. Last night I ordered beef with broccoli but had to send it back because the meat was over cooked and as tough as shoe leather. My friend had the Pad Thai and it came out burnt! The spare ribs  we had for our appetizer only came to life once we doused them in peanut sauce. One thing I did thoroughly enjoy was my cocktail. I ordered a cosmo and it was delectable,  citrusy  and strong. I had two. They were the best part of the meal. I think that they're always so busy 'cuz the location is fantastic and I am unaware of another Thai restaurant in the area. I would definitely go back for drinks, and maybe an appetizer if I was starving, but not for a meal.", "author": "Arlene J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "National is one of those places that I can always rely on for a solid meal. As other reviewers have mentioned, the quality of the food has dwindled just a bit in the last year, but the portions you get can't be beat for the price you pay. I love their curry puffs, tom ka gai (coconut soup w/ chicken \u0026 mushrooms), and pad see ew. \n\nThe staff there is also a huge reason why I keep coming back. They've always been very friendly and efficient. Many of the wait staff recognize the regulars. \n\nIt seems to be a pretty popular dinner date spot. The space isn't the biggest, so expect a short wait on weekend (and some weekday) evenings.

They make these chicken curry puffs (think Thai empanadas), that I had to re-order at the end of my meal. Yes, to take home, after I had eaten one whole puff and a full meal. I ate them later. Don't judge me till you've tried it.\n\nOf course we had other items from the menu... Green coconut curry with chicken and vegetables... glass noodles with veg.

I've worked in a few Thai restaurants before and eat Thai food very often and the pad see ew was just not good, though I ordered it thinking \"hard to mess this one up\" after reading some sub-par reviews. It inexplicably came with a lemon (which is the first time I've ever seen it served that way--soy sauce and lemon don't really mix) and it was over-seasoned with garlic yet under-seasoned with soy sauce, which might explain why other people complain about the bland taste. The lighting in there erred on the side of being too dark to read the menu and the bad ventilation in there means you're smothered by the smell of smoky stir fry.

Its clear these are prepared earlier then just sit there until someone orders them. \n\nThe beef was very tough and there were fewer than 5-6 small pieces of beef in the entire curry.\n\nWhen I called I told the lady that I had been pleased with the quality before. She said that the beef should be tough and overcooked. That's the way its prepared. I have been to Thailand and have eaten at many Thai restaurants in the city.
