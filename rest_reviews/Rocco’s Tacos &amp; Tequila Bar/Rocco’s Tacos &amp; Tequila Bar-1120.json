It's a really nice atmosphere, and great service, the waitress was attentive and cared. But the food was just not good, and very over priced 2 tacos meal with a side if rice and salad 12.25 lol .. wow.

She is absolutely amazing!!! She was very attentive to us making sure that we were okay and that are drinks were constantly filled for unlimited mimosas!  On Sundays NY isn't allowed to serve alcohol until noon so at literally 11:59 am she had mimosas ready for us! She was very personable and really cool to talk to!  Definitely my favorite experience I have ever had at any restaurant!  I've been back here and I only ask for Jean to have as my waitress. She remembers me and gives me a big hug!  I couldn't ask for a better experience at Rocco's Tacos!  It's a little out of my way since I live in Manhattan, but it is always worth the trip.  I can't wait to go back soon :) The food is super delicious and the portions are huge so you leave with a full stomach!  I recommend ordering guacamole and chips...it's made table side.", "author": "Amy S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-15", "description": "Nice environment, good food and drinks.

Great experience as a 1st timer. The waiter AARON was excellent. Very personable, outgoing and very attentive. The manager ZENA (hopefully I spelled it correctly) was also very outgoing and attentive. The food was excellent. I'm not really into guacamole BUT since they make it right in front of you I decided to give it a try and it was delicious. Only disappointment was that some of the drinks are not offered or available in a pitcher. One drink that should be offered in a pitcher is that WATERMELON KISS. That drink was so good. Please look into offering some of the other drinks in pitcher form. Definitely will be going back. As a matter of fact, maybe today just to see how the brunch is.", "author": "Christopher C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-08", "description": "The Applebee's of Mexcian dining.\nOn the plus side, it's a large menu.\n\nWe ordered the \"table-side\" guacamole and seafood tacos (shrimp, grilled fish, etc.). Food came out fast (good). Food quality seemed ok, but lacked any real substance or authenticity. Mind you, I'm not unaware that good Mexican food in Brooklyn is rare, but I was really optimistic about this place (despite that it's a chain). For what you get, it's too expensive (lunch with drinks was ~$70 + tip). \n\nWhen we walked in and asked for a table (around ~1pm-ish), the restaurant was largely empty; a few booths with people, but tons of tables and bar stools wide open. Oddly the waitress asked if we would wait 5 minutes to be seated so that they could clear a table for us. So, we just opted to sit at the bar rather than in the twilight-zone dining room. \n\nAt the bar, it took the bartender ~5 - 7 minutes to notice us (again, most stools open), but when she did, she gave us menus (good). From there, service was fine.", "author": "josh s."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-26", "description": "Went last night to Rocco's.... great spot. .. upbeat party fun atmosphere. ... decor was awesome. ...tequila list was great... the tequila room when you walk in was one of the best I've ever seen.. .. was like a Giant glass tequila humidor....loved the private rooms behind the tequila room with the milagro branded chairs... I want them.... the drinks were great... the dj was great playing dance music from all times...  ceviche of the day was out of this world.. . The roccos tacos app were very good... they were tuna with some sort of cinnamon seasoning.... nothing like I've ever had..   the queso fundido which is one of my favorite things to eat was just ok... was kind of in the soupy side.... wasn't impressed with that.... the chips and salsa were great! The chops have this Chipotle pepper type seasoning that's great and the salsa is a chopped tomatoe one...  like a Pico de gallo..... loved it.... the table side guac was good...I like mine chunky but they mashed it to puree.... so make sure you ask for it chunky.... the tacos were good... small .... almost like they should give you some more for the money but really good... at least you have room to try alot... service was good and the manager came around to make sure everything was good....  the only reasons for giving it 4 stars and not 5 was the queso fundido..... the size of the tacos.... and because my friend was just down in Florida saying let's go to Rocco's in Brooklyn for taco Tuesday's.... he had said how great it was with all you could eat tacos .. but they didn't have the same special in NY... guess ill have to take a trip to Florida ;)... still a must try in Brooklyn! !.", "author": "Matthew M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-16", "description": "Great staff, nice ambience and plasmas in the bathrooms!

My bridal shower brunch was held there and the service was simply impeccable. We were given a choice as to where to be seated since it was a special event and a large group. We had two servers so we were always taken care of, The manager also gave us tequila shots on the house due to the special occasion. Our drinks were never empty, our food was brought out in a timely manner and plates taken away as soon as we were done eating. Thank you all for such great service. My bridal shower was amazing.
