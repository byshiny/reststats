I visit this place last nite with a friend As soon as We walk in the place seemed to have a great potential, decor was nice and colorful, music was decent, atmosphere was welcoming, the waitress was really attentive and helpful, we order a \"guacamole \" the avocado was soggy and the ingredients looked old, the guy making it was a great guy but he's guac if you can call it guac was nasty and tasteless! From the menu we order fry plantain (BIG RED FLAG) what Mexican restaurant has plain rain in the menu!? They where burn and dry! I ordered 2 ground beef \"spicy\" tacos and 2 fish tacos, worst tacos I have ever tasted (who ever judge taco bell as best Mexican food must of gone to this place before, because anything is better) she ordered Brooklyn tacos they tasted nasty the cole and cauliflower was dry and cold. And please let me not even get stared on the tortillas! Cold, hard, tasteless, and dry.

They have $2.00 off drinks and $7.00 appetizers.  I had 2 margaritas which were good however they're drinks are about $11.00 and above and the l drinks were strong.  For Brooklyn its not a great price for happy hour especially when there are places in Manhattan with just as good drinks half their happy hour price.  \n\nThe bartender was less than helpful too she gave me the happy hour menu and didn't take my order. She had a little attitude. \n\nIf I go back it would probably be on Taco Tuesday and maybe get the Sangria. \n\nOverall experience, meh.", "author": "Bklynzizi P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-16", "description": "Albert Lugo has been putting this dining room on his back from day 1.

I ordered them every time i came here... (and i only come here because it's next door to work). They were so bad I almost didn't want to pay for it. The margarita was frozen mango juice with no mango flavor. No a single drop of alcohol. The nachos were made with all broken chips. It looked like the left overs from the bottom of the bag. So disappointed. I told the waitress and she looked at them and didn't say anything. I'm not coming back here again.", "author": "Alicia C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-02-17", "description": "My inclination that this establishment was mediocre unfortunately turned out to be correct. While the margaritas and guacamole were decent, the fajita dish for two was both extremely overpriced and revolting. I'm not sure what type of sauce was used in the medley of different meats, but I will surely have nightmares about it.  Also, don't expect much of the sides that come with the fajita, because there are barely any. To anyone reading this, PLEASE try a different Mexican cuisine restaurant- totally not worth the 50 dollars a person that this meal cost.", "author": "Josh S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-02", "description": "So far my experience has not been great. My little sister recommended this spot because she came here with her crew. She raved about the food and drinks. \n\nSince I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a pleasant hostess and an eager-to-serve waitress who took our drink order. When she came back around to our table, 15 MINUTES LATER, she asked what were the drinks we ordered. How difficult is it to remember two mango margaritas??\n\nWhen she finally brought the drinks, she wanted to know if we were ready to order. Of course we were! WE HAD 15 MINUTES TO CHOOSE OUR FOOD! \n\nWhen one of the managers, who came out of a Managers-R-Us kit, super cute btw, was walking around to check on the customers, I waved him over to our table. I asked him if he remembered the time that we came into the restaurant. He correctly answered, \"about an hr ago. Is everything ok?\"  I gave him the min-by-min of our experience so far. And I didn't even mention the fact that the ladies' room, that had 4 stalls, had no toilet paper NOR paper towels. What was I supposed to do? Bring my dinner linen with me to use the bathroom??\n\nFinally the food came... the order was wrong. I'm done. I'm OUT.

The seasoning they use is available for sale so that was a plus for me. The food was amazing , I had an assortment of street tacos (crunchy ) the chorizo, the ground beef , the chicken . In addition to my tacos I had the black beans and seasoned rice\nTo compliment those awesome tacos. The only thing that wasn't great about the experience was the wait . So once we where sat ,we waited about fifteen minutes before we greeted by our server. There was a gentleman who walked over to us and then said oh wait your not my table , but never did he say I will find your server , it was rather awkward . Now once we got a server she was very pleasant very efficient , the food wait took a little while but that wasn't a reflection of her that was the kitchen . I would definitely return , how ever they need to\nImprove on the time it takes for the server to greet the table , 15 minutes is a long time. I mentioned this to Management on the way out , I told him I set the timer on my phone so I'm not embellishing the time at all. The over all experience was cool despite all of the waiting , please please try the guacamole!", "author": "Tiffany L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-05", "description": "Great, chill spot for lunch and dinner. Went there for dinner with a big group and they were very accommodating which I love. I like the vibes in there and the food was good too. I had tacos shrimp and fish. I like the shrimp better because the fish was a little bit dry for me. My favorite part was the guac, simply because they made from scratch right in from of you.

I talked so highly about this spot, even had a double date with my best friend and they weren't too happy. \nThe host was pretty rude to my best friends husband...\nWe waited for about 15 min to get seated and tried to enjoy ourselves, I jumped on yelp to check the recent reviews and what food looked appealing. \nWe were greeted by the friendly server which changed the atmosphere, until we had to ask twice about our appetizer (The guacomole) We noticed people who came in after us were getting there guac prepared before we received it. We spoke with the server at first and she apologized and asked one of her co workers who made the guacomole whats going on; he rolled his eyes and walked away and she said thats what im dealing with. #MESSY...We just wanted our guac lol no drama. Sadly we waited so long I had to go the manager personally. Tifa the manager corrected the situation and noticed the same rude worker went to the wrong table to make the guac...all this confusion for guacamole ughh \nI checked in on yelp and showed the server she wasnt sure so she called the manager.\nThe check in offer doesnt work anymore btw prob should update it we were pretty bummed about it.\nI ordered the shrimp quesadilla that was really yummy and my boyfriend got the baja tacos.....his rice was not fully cooked it was as if they were rushing and threw some uncooked rice in his plate. I was in disbelief. We didnt have the energy to complain just got a margarita and quickly ate and exited.", "author": "Zenda D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-09", "description": "Worst possible service with the bar server very selective un-attentive only to us, loud obnoxious rude shall I continue, we have never had that type of treatment before, and what I believe was a manager came and saw yet didn't do anything.

The food came out really quick for how busy they were. Kid friendly. The Jalape\u00f1o Margarita is worth a try.

The service here needs much improvement as well.\n\nFirst, when my boyfriend and I approached the hostess, we asked for a table of two. The hostess knew I was addressing her, she was looking right at me but her colleague decided to keep talking to her about non work related issues and she turned away to pay attention to her colleague. Afterwards she had to ask me to repeat myself because it seemed more important to talk to her colleague, then to keep listening to me. \n\nSecond, our interaction with our server was brief and quite awkward. She came and introduced herself and then asked right off the bat what kind if spice level we would like for the guacamole. As if she just assumed that's what we were going to order it and then awkwardly stood there without saying anything. We told her we were ready to order and she just said yup, I'm ready and didn't take out a notepad to take our order. Which is fine, but she ended up getting our order wrong.\n\nWe had ordered the Enchiladas Rojas (Pork Enchildas) but we ended up getting up getting the Enchiladas Verdes (Chicken) instead. We also wanted to order a drink as well but since she never came back, it seemed like worthless to even bother. \n\nThe table side guacamole was a nice touch but there was a bit too much lime juice in it. The elotes (my all time favorite) were nicely presented but just tasted like warm corn. Needed a bit more mayo and cotija cheese. The enchilada and taco itself as okay, but not really worth the price since I've had terrific tacos for much less.\n\nDon't expect too much from this place.
