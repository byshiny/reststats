I have been going to Grimaldi's with my family since I can remember. Yes, you do wait in line all the time. Yes, the pizza is great! A few of us even purchased Grimaldi's t-shirts! We always take my family from Italy when they come to visit \u0026 no one ever complains. They talk about Grimaldi's pizza all the time. If that doesn't tell you that the pizza is good, I don't know what will. Also, if you have a large group, get a pie \u0026 a calzone! The calzones are just as delicious as the pizza. I love that it's in such a great location, close to the Brooklyn bridge \u0026 near the water. It can get touristy, but this place is worth the wait!", "author": "Giovanna A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-11", "description": "I really don't understand the hype.

Toppings are just toppings but it's the crust that makes a great pizza. I savored every bite until it was all gone. It was the best. Only complaint was they didn't have fountain drinks. A cup of ice and a $3.00 twenty ounce coke is what you got . But then I thought about that delicious, savory, wonderful crust...and all was once again harmonious in the universe.", "author": "David C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-31", "description": "Good pizza but you are coming here more for the experience. Make sure you get here and start lining up before they open, otherwise the wait can definitely be long. Not the cheapest pizza either, but its a great vibe at the restaurant, the pizza is made with really good ingredients and you really get the New York feeling when you are in this place (maybe that is why so many tourists come here after their walk across the Brooklyn Bridge). Worth a trip once, for sure!", "author": "Cynthia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-22", "description": "I do NOT recommend going to Grimaldis. The pizza is good, but not worth the wait or the awful service. If you want to wait an hour for decent pizza and lousy service, suit  yourself. Within 1 week I had pizza at 3 different pizza places in 3 different cities: Grimaldis in NYC, Pitch in Omaha, and Settebellos in SLC. While good, Grimaldis was the worst of the three with the absolute worst service. Settebellos was best and Pitch was a close second, only beat because the crust at Settebellos is amazing. When you can get better pizza in both Omaha and Salt Lake City, you know Grimaldis ain't anything special. ... BTW: Settebellos is part of Vera Pizza Napoletana, an international organization that promotes authentic Naples-style pizza (http://americas.pizzanapoletana.org/), so yes you can have great pizza in Utah.", "author": "Mr. M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-02", "description": "Really great pizza with a unique, chewy dough.

The line as usual was insanely long for those waiting to sit and eat but the food was worth it. Customer service was good and the place for the most part was clean inside. The prices for the most part are right on par with other famous pizzeria's in the city. The only thing I did not like is the noise level at the restaurant as everyone working at this place is running around like crazy. Grimaldi's is my second favorite pizza joint in the city and if you are in Brooklyn you definitely have to check this place out.

A native New Yorker that had his fair share of pizza slices, this is by far the best I've had. It's true this pizza is not your classic NYC pizza, but rather tastes like a slice of Italy. As long as the wait and the travel under or over the Brooklyn Bridge its definitely worth the wait.", "author": "Mark M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-11", "description": "Not the best pizza I've ever had but definitely worth trying it out at least once before you die! The mozzarella is packed heavily on this pizza and will definitely fill you up. Very good pizza.

It was fresh and the crust was delish but the overall experience left us wanting more. \nThe wait combined with the grumpy staff was not fun and then we were underwhelmed by the food. I know it's New York, I get the attitude, in fact I kind of like it, but when your customers are all hungry and anxiously waiting for hours, the least you can do is pretend not to be annoyed. Would have all been worth it if the pizza was better. \nSorry Grimaldi's, I wouldn't leave this review if I thought it would make that long ass line go away, but I know it won't.", "author": "Kristin R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-21", "description": "Amazing pizza but usually a long wait.

I grew up in Chicago so grew up a deep dish lover but this place is amazing, some of the best pizza I've ever had! Worth the wait and the line moves fast. All thin crust pizza, NY style. Definitely worth making the trip to Brooklyn for. I also recently tried Lombardi's, which was good, but I thought Grimaldis was better.

I think the large is 20\" which I'm guessing would feed 3-4 people.\n\nThe new place on the corner has a lot more space then the old place, but still expect to see a line coming out.  And they still look at you like cr@p!\n\nAll in all, for me the best pizza in New York.  So go ahead, embrace the fact that there are tourists there.  The tables are packed so tight that you will end up speaking to them anyway - may as well enjoy it!\n\nOh yeah - cash only.  Don't make the mistake I did - they look at you even worse when you hand them a wad of coins and dollar bills.

I went to the one in Chelsea and left disappointed. We ordered a ceaser salad and cheese pizza. The salad was the same as anywhere else and the pizza while good lacked the dazzling factor. What made this an eh visit though was the service. I had to ask 3 times to get my drink even though the place was nearly empty. I have been a server in the past and never would I leave my customer without a drink while I chit-chat with my buddy. That being said it also took about forever to get the check.
