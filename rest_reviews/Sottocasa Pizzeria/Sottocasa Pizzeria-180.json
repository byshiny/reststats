We ordered 4 pizzas and a prosciutto salad.\n\nThe overall feel of the restaurant is pretty rustic. There is seating both indoors and outdoors. It feels very homey and I really enjoyed the ambiance.\n\nTo the food! The prosciutto salad was really good. It came with prosciutto, arugula, and fresh mozzarella. Sometimes I am a bit cautious about prosciutto because it can be too fat, too salty, or have a weird smell/taste, but this one had none of those so it was really good! The pizzas for the most part was pretty good. We ordered one of the calzone-esque pizzas, eggplant pizza, one with tomatoes and cheese, and another that eludes my mind... From a taste perspective, it was pretty good, except a few of them got really droopy. I'm not sure if it was from the toppings or perhaps the dough was undercooked? So I would say that was one of the detractors. We also ordered dessert. The tiramisu was really good! Very moist and creamy, but not too sweet. My friends also raved about the Nutella pizza, but I passed since I was carbed out at this point...\n\nLast thing to add is service was kind of slow...I think we sat down for a full 20 minutes or so before someone came around to take our order. However they were pretty attentive once we got our order in and food started coming out. I would come here again.", "author": "Esther C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-01", "description": "Glad to see the pizza is still excellent.

The pies are a little watery, which the menu notes is intentional because it's Neapolitan, and I actually like it more than traditional pizza. The ingredients are very fresh, and it's always cooked just the perfect amount to bring out the flavors.\n\nI recommend the spinaci salad as an appetizer and the radicchio or boscaiola pizzas. \n\nIt's also a little cheaper than some of the other sit down pizza places nearby, and the Italian beers they serve are excellent.", "author": "Tony D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-24", "description": "Place is a cool lil spot.

Their white pizzas are especially good (because it's a thin crust, the tomato sauce based pizzas feel a little more soggy).  The service is amazing.

The vibe was very chill and psuedo romantic.  They had a great menu with lots of fun Italian IPA beers and specials.  We were here for the PIZZA though.  The dough was nice and light and fluffy, their cheeses were all great, the ingredients were high quality.

Whoever is running the kitchen at Sottocasa should be appointed Postmaster General.  Anyway, both selections -- Salsiccia and 4 Fromagio -- were very tasty.  The crust was relatively thin, with fine texture and just the right amount of char.  The red sauce on the Salsciccia pizza was tangy and the sausage was great.  The cheese pizza was generously covered in an array of cheeses and also garnered favorable reviews.  I don't think I'd walk a mile in a blizzard for this pizza, but maybe a half-mile.  Delivery was unparalleled.", "author": "Mark W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-09", "description": "My server Francesco was less than thrilled to help me this evening, my date and I ordered 2 pizzas and 2 beers and were given attitude throughout the whole interaction. Our thin crust pizzas were cooked in a wood burning oven, but only our crust were crispy, the food was filling none the less. When we were handed dessert menus I just didn't have space, everything sounded appetizing but I couldn't fit another thing. When Francesco asked if we would be ordering my date politely said no, at which point we were met with more attitude and eye rolls. On my way I out I said thank you and goodnight, at which point Francesco ignored me the bartender politely said bye. Would not recommend for any reason.", "author": "Amy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-24", "description": "Great pizzeria in Brooklyn offering a wide selection of appetizers, pizze rosse and pizza blanche.\n\nFor the appetizer course, I had Barbabietole. The roasted beets were pleasantly sweet and could have been better balanced by more goat cheese in the whipped cheese mix. \n\nThe Taleggio pizza (mozzarella, taleggio, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano reggiano, basil) was a clear winner as it was of the right thickness and was topped with a generous helping of prosciutto, making it well worth its price tag.  A few more basil leaves would have really helped to kick it up another notch!\n\nHoping that this place will soon be open for lunch as well!", "author": "Shulin T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "Truly the best pizza I've had in a long time.

I tried the burrata and taleggio pies. The burrata was delicious and slightly creamy, with cherry tomatoes taking place of tomato sauce.

The vibe inside is cute and rustic and the staff was very nice there and authentically Italian. I was there on the early side of a Saturday evening in advance of s concert, so it wasn't too crowded. There were families with kids there getting an early dinner and it seems like a great choice for a weekend meal. \n\nOne thing to note: this is not a slice place.

At first glance, it doesn't look like much. But make no mistake: this is not your average slice joint.\n\nThere is little on the menu besides pizza, with options ranging from $9-$19. There are two lists of pies: one that you can feel free to add toppings to, and Le Speciali di Sottocasa, which they ask you to eat as they have been designed. We opted to share one of each... A simple margherita ($11), and the Laura: fresh-crushed Italian plum tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, speck, mascarpone and rosemary ($18). \n\nBoth pies arrived lightning quick, and I honestly couldn't say which I preferred because they were both perfectly executed and conceived, but so very different. The mascarpone and speck certainly gave the specialty pie a richness the classic margherita lacked, but both offered that slightly charred, chewy Napoli crust and a freshness that reflects impeccable ingredients. I would happily order either again, but I have a feeling I'll slowly make my way through the entire list, because this is a place I plan on eating often.\n\nIf Neapolitan is your preferred pizza, do yourself a favor and stop by Sottocasa. \n__________\n\n*I can't blame you.
