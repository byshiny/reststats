Where I'm from you can only get Banh Mi on weekend mornings and it's like a special treat, so the idea that you could get Banh Mi 7 days a week if you wanted just blew my mind when I got to Brooklyn and I think I had one every day my first week in New York.

Thank goodness Hanco was here to relieve me of my virginity.  So good we dined here three times during our stay in Carroll Gardens - and we felt oh-so-cool when we were informed that Hanco's was the subject of a This American Life piece recently.  \n\nThe banh mis were excellent, served on warm, fresh rolls with the freshest of fillings, and the vermicelli salads were light and perfectly seasoned.  Everything is made to order, and they have a great selection of magazines for those who decide to dine in.

I have been known to experience this feeling from time to time. \n\nHanco's does a pretty good job of helping me out. If it were closer, I would go more often. I usually get the pork sandwich. The meat is tender and tasty - not dry like I've had in other similar sandwiches. The veggies are plentiful (but could use a little more pickling). The mayo level is good too. The bread is soft and chewy, and I'm ok with that. I was also impressed that when I ordered my sandwich spicy, they sure as hell made it actually spicy. Many places say spicy but really mean mild (which is not ideal for someone who looooves spicy food). Hanco's loaded up my sandwich with some tasty peppers that did the job.

It was only after grabbing a seat that I realized how much my meal cost.\n\nEight dollars, really? I thought to myself. Eight?!\n\nOf course, an eight dollar meal is rather a steal in New York, a city where bars have the balls to charge you that much for a beer. But I didn't order a fancy microbrew or anything fancy-- I got bahn mi!\n\nFor the folks who never got to try the dish, bahn mi, or Vietnamese sandwich, is a baguette sliced lengthwise and stuffed with some sort of meat and ribbons of pickled carrots, daikon, cilantro, onion, and jalapeno. Bahn mis are not only absolutely delicious, but they're also usually really cheap, something like $4 or less for a sandwich (I really like Saigon in Little Italy-- $3.75!). In fact, my love for bahn mis began in high school, because I realized that the local Vietnamese place sold sandwiches that were half the price of Subway subs but infinitely more edible.\n\nIn disbelief, I checked the Hanco's menu-- $5.75 for pork bahn mi, $2.25 for Vietnamese iced coffee. This better be damn good, I thought.\n\nHanco's is a tiny, but busy Vietnamese shop on Bergen Street and Smith. When my friend and I visited on a cold January afternoon, we were first met with a long line. Oh no, I thought, I'd hate to be without tables and be forced to eat outside in the cold. Luckily for us, most of the people in line were ordering to-go, and after ordering, my friend and I were able to snag a small wooden table in the rather crowded dining space.\n\nLooking at the growing line, I began to imagine that maybe Hanco's charged $2 more than I expected because their sandwiches are that much more delicious. Hanco's already had a strike in my book for being expensive, but that could easily be remedied by an exceptional sandwich.\n\nSo we waited. And waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nBahn mis, like your deli sub, usually take no more than 10 minutes to be made. At Hancos, my friend and I waited an excruciatingly long 30 minutes as we sat in the overheated shop listening to three 13 year old girls talk about boys. I winced every 30 seconds realizing I used to say the same exact things.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived, both my friend and I dove for the hot sandwiches. Just as I was about to take a bite, my friend commented, \"aren't these things suppose to be on a baguette?\"\n\nWhile there isn't a cardinal rule that states bahn mis have to be on a baguette, the hero-roll type bread that the sandwich was made with was a inferior substitution. Not only was it smaller (less food), but it didn't offer as many texture variation as a baguette (who am I kidding? I, like every other girl raised in America, love a good baguette. End of story).\n\nI hated the sandwich from Hanco's. It wasn't just the bread-- it was everything! While the grilled pork was well cooked, it had that distinctive Chinese food flavor to it that I couldn't shake off. While I'm not a stickler for authenticity, I hated that this flavor ran foul with the cilantro. And unfortunately, because their bahn mi spread used way too much mayo, I couldn't even taste the vegetables other than the cilantro and the jalapeno.\n\nThis already made a really bad sandwich, but what I really hated was their \"spicy\" sauce which was just Sriracha sauce. Had I known that their spicy sauce was just that, I would have gotten the regular and added the sauce myself, instead of being forced to eat a sandwich in which the hot sauce was indiscriminately poured on.\n\nAnd here we come to the embarrassing point in the story. I came here while my lip piercings were still somewhat fresh... and I got Sriracha sauce in.\n\nI almost cried.\n\nHanco's-- bad expensive sandwiches that makes girls cry.", "author": "Sienna K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-16", "description": "I am not a Vietnamese sandwich expert.\n\nThese sandwiches are awesome.

Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more. \n\nI'm used to paying $2.50-3.50 for banh mi in DC and Boston. Excellent banh mi, to boot. And usually if you buy 5, you get one free. At $5.25 per banh mi with no volume order discount, this banh mi had better contain kobe beef, foie gras and filet mignon. Alas, it did not.\n\nI had the classic with medium spicy sauce, extra butter, no veggies. The roasted ground pork made the banh mi very sweet. The vietnamese ham and pate tasted fresh. The baguette was too chewy. It was a few inches shorter than the average banh mi but it was packed with meat. It was very flavorful but I feel like Hanco's caters to a western palate. \n\nThe owners of Hanco's speak my language and I'm not Vietnamese. It's Cantonese-owned and run which further detracts from the authenticity. The place is small but efficiently run. There are a few small tables.\n\nHanco's seems to be the only banh mi shop in the hood so hopefully more will pop up soon to drive the price down.", "author": "P W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-25", "description": "At first glance, this may look like just a sandwich shop, but Hanco's serves up the type of food that will haunt you.

At less than $5 a pop, it's the best bargain on this block and tastier than most of the other offerings nearby. \n\nThe bubble tea is loaded with boba -- Hanco's serves up at least double the portion of chewy, tapioca beads as Beard Papa.
