There were about 20 of us. \n\nWhat a beautiful spot! It looks like a small cozy restaurant and a bar when u walk in but there is also a hidden magical speak easy. The ambience is beyond great! The cocktails are beautifully made. The glass wear is unbelievable and medieval. \nWe only had appetizers and they were delicious (smoked salmon, nuts, olives, foie gras). \nAnd lastly, the stuff was the most pleasant group of people. They were friendly, professional, attentive, polite and fast. \n\nIt is a perfect space for a date too!

We had the skate with lemon butter and fava beans. The sour and the creamy flavors merged perfectly to create an exquisite dish. The drinks were great too - I had the bisou (bourbon based cocktail) and my husband had the Cote du Rhone, both of which were excellent. Perhaps the only thing I would say they could improve would be the bread.

Super cute and cozy inside, my waiter was attentive and nice but food took forever to come out - definitely over an hour. When it did arrive it was bland. They also jacked up one of our orders but ended up giving it to us on the house which was cool. A couple next to me was going off on the owner because they to were waiting on their food. I don't think I'll be giving this place another chance sadly.", "author": "Camille W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-03", "description": "Cute little place.

We were 2 people and they sat us at a table that seemed to be halfway into the main walking area of the restaurant. In reality, this table shouldn't have existed in the restaurant's layout. \n2. No one ever came to ask us if we wanted another drink or check on us. When we finally got our waiter's attention, he took my wine glass without asking and it still had wine in it that I was drinking! \n3. It took an inappropriately long time for us to get our second round of drinks. \n\nOverall the food was very good so I'm hoping these issues are a one-off thing.  We had the beet and goat cheese salad (tasty), sardines app special (bones were too tedious), salmon with ratatouille (medium rare and delicious), and the fish of the day (a white fish with a name I can't recall, served with a fennel salad - both were excellent).  \n\nI would go back and hope the service is better.", "author": "Gati D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-26", "description": "Minus 1 star for slow service, but 5 stars for food and beverage.

At the time we showed up was happy hour, they were only serving  $1 oysters  and drinks. So we ended up getting oysters ( tried all 3 kinds- the cupcake were the best). We also got french onion soup (so good), the frog legs (first time for both my boyfriend and myself) and were very pleasantly surprised.

My family was visiting me South Brooklyn after a show and we popped in here for dinner. I got a 'soup of the day' which was a creamy cauliflower soup and my parents got the classic French onion soup, which was just perfect. My sister got the Thai mussels and we split it. So much flavor!

We literally got on the first bus we saw and got off as soon as we hit the Cobble Hill dining district. Chez Moi looks relatively new and rather typical of the types of restaurants opening up between Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights these days, but that's usually a good thing.\n\nThe atmosphere was lively but contained on Friday night and our wait was about 5 minutes without reservations. They really make the most out of space here--our table was in a narrow back aisle, but it quickly got cozy the way these types of nooks often do. The drinks were good. I tried their signature cocktail  (vodka, fresh mint, \nlime, cassis, soda), which was pretty refreshing.\n\nFood-wise, we shared the grilled octopus with hummus and harissa, which was tasty but tiny for the $12 tab (hey, if you want a big chunk of squid, go Greek). The mussels, on the other hand, were a huge portion and delicious. Fries, mayo and ketchup, and I was a happy camper.", "author": "Yan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "Amazing atmosphere!
