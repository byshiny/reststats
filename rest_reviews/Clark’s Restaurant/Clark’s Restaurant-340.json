Funnily enough I got the same table; perfect for watching the world go by.\n\nAs a tourist visiting from the UK this is what we imagine a diner to be. No theme...just good food and service.\n\nI had eggs benedict and coffee and then eggs and sausage and pancakes. All were superb. And all were pretty reasonably priced.\n\nWandering around Brooklyn Heights afterwards I found the place I would like to live in New York. Lack of visa, employment and money means I have no chance but it's nice to dream!", "author": "Neil M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-30", "description": "Great gem!

Yet the owner stands at the front of the line and makes sure to warmly greet every single person as if he's known you for years.  Most of the waitstaff are also just as gracious, and genuinely look happy when they recognize you as a repeat customer.\n\nTheir corned beef hash is the best in the city.  Even when you order for delivery, the eggs arrive perfect (not overcooked), and the corned beef isn't smushy.\n\nMy favorite dinner entree is the spaghetti carbonara.  I always ask for the bacon extra crispy.  The pink lemonade is actually frozen slush!

You know, I usually expect a pretty generic meal and atmosphere when i hit up diners, but Clark's proved to be a quality, intimate brunch experience despite the weekend crowds.  I was intimidated when i saw the line of people waiting for a table at 1pm on a Sunday and almost walked out.  However, the owner came right up to us \u0026 assured us the wait would be short.  He was right.  Tables turn quickly, so we only waited abot 5 minutes.  Furthermore, the owner/host came by multiple times to check in on us, which made us feel right at home.\n\nThe window tables are great \u0026 provided a great view for people watching down Henry St.  Service was good, and there was an all-around friendly, cozy vibe.\n\nPancakes are a must and a good value - I could only eat half of my plate.  i had them with walnuts mixed in - added a delicious crunch!  I was also very impressed with the sausage.  A little crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked.", "author": "Rachel W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-19", "description": "if you are looking for a big, american, diner kind of breakfast then head over to Clark's alright.   I live closer to Tom's in Prospect Heights but there's to much drama there for a cup of coffee and some eggs.  Clark's is easy -- good prices, more space than Tom's, the service is OK - but hey aren't you going for pancakes -- if you want service go somewhere in the city and pay $40 for breakfast w/fresh squeezed juice.  Clarks is fast in - fast out == you can pay $10 - 15 for a good breakfast and a cup of coffee.  \n\nAnother note:  do you have folks visiting - this is a good spot to go have a cheap/big breakfast -- then walk down the street and see some great sites.......walk along the waterfront and to the brooklyn bridge its great.", "author": "Ib B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-03-28", "description": "Ordered a grilled cheese and got cussed out by the waiter!\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato. It arrived. Bit into it. No cheese. Opened it and looked. The amount of cheese was sort of the amount of butter you'd put on toast. I tried to gently point this out to the waiter and got an \"F- You!\" \n\nSeriously.\n\nNever coming back.

Clarke's really is a higher level diner.  You can get great omelletes, pancakes, and waffles for breakfast.  They also have an amazing turkey burger.   It really is packed on Saturday and Sunday morning for brunch so be warned that you'll have to wait.  And they deliver....early.

I recommend it because the prices are pretty decent and I love the diner menu with the restaurant atmosphere. The waiters are all really nice and the service is excellent.

My biggest qualm with the Restaurant, one shared with many other goers, was that substitutes are not allowed in a meal-- unless you're willing to pay much more. For example, they wouldn't allow me to substitute the broccoli in my omelet for spinach though spinach was an option. They also only serve large portions for breakfast options (no half stack pancakes allowed!).
