In fact, for the dish to be prepared correctly the fried batter should be minimal and light and not even form a continuous crust or coat if you will around the squid.

We had to really flag down the wait staff in order to get service (and menus).  The place was also quite loud.\n\nAll in all, I think there are better options for italian food in the area.

We waited in line for 25 mins, sat down and the waitress comes over and was like \"oh let me get you your menu.\" 15 minutes later she totally forgot about us, did not bring us the drinks we ordered even though we tried to wave her over a few times. We ended up asking another waiter for a menu while our waitress chats with other people in the restaurant. Throughout the whole meal, she did not pour us any water or ask us how things tasted - she however, was extremely attentive to the guests who were sitting right next to us. Thanks so much for making us feel like we didn't even exist in the room. \n\nAbout the food:\n\nSeafood Fettuccine with shrimp, clam, and mussels was OK. Yes, the pasta was fresh and chewy, but that's about it. The seafood was over cooked. Shrimps were dried, and clams were so cooked that they shrunk smaller than a dime size. The mussels were not fresh at all and had a weird smell when you chew on it. \n\nLasagna was not good at all. It was too soft and the ground beef in it tasted like bad meat loaf left over from a week ago. \n\nThank you for a fantastic experience....NOT.", "author": "Katie Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "Lovely old school Italian American vibe and thoughtfully prepared dishes.

Closed bakeries, an indie cinema, a quiet wine bar. And then, a crowd. There was no sign to clearly identify it, but I knew just by the presence of a crowd that we had arrived at none other than noodle pudding.\n\nThe decor and ambience are simply pleasant. There's a lot of ppl so don't expect a quiet evening. \n\nSo the first step you should take upon arrival is to walk past the line of ppl and find the host (who is one of the waiters) and give him your name, lest someone cuts you while you wait for the host to cone to you, a was what happened to me.\n\nAnyway, 20 min later my date and I were given the center table by the front window. Lucky. We could enjoy the breeze and people watch both patrons and passersby. \n\nOk on to the food. $10 appetizers, pasta between $10-20 and main dishes more than $20. House wine was $14 a bottle and was delicious. \n\nThe menu is heavy in Italian so I found myself googling a lot. Ended up getting the calamari for an appetizer and lasagna as my entr\u00e9e. \n\nThe calamari wasn't that good. That is a major downgrade for someplace with such a string reputation. Texture was fine but the taste was a bit off. And the sauce they gave was neither plentiful nor outstanding. As for the lasagna, it was a small portion, looked real good, but not enough sauce.\n\nOk so bottom line. Initially I thought that the portions were small but more filling than they appeared. In hindsight, I attribute my fullness to inflammation. What is that, say you? It is basically when part of your body swells up, like your ankle when you sprain it. Well I basically had intestinal inflammation. How do I know? Because not only was I uncharacteristically full status post appetizer, but status post meal I had status diarrhea. Can I say with absolute certainty that it was the calamari or lasagna or noodle pudding period? No. But I did not eat much else for quite some time beforehand.\n\n+1 ambience\n+1 service (better than anticipated from reviews)\n+1 presentation\n-1 bang for buck\n+1 deliciously cheap house wine\n+1 variety\n-1 bad calamari (should be a staple)\n-1 diarrhea\n\nSauce lovers will be disappointed. Cheese lovers will not be. Glad I went, but this place is way overhyped. Will rather go to a small joint or little Italy.", "author": "Timothy T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-27", "description": "My sister and I went here to carbo load before the Brooklyn Half.  Though the restaurant was packed on a Friday night, we were lucky and only had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. \n\nWhile our server was really nice, the service itself wasn't fast. It wasn't terrible (compared to some of the other reviews I read) but I would avoid going here at peak times if I could. We had Tagliatelle Bolognese, a pasta with clams dish and for dessert, prosecco crema with fresh fruit. The pasta was obviously homemade and really good. The bolognese was better than the clam dish though. The dessert was also really good and a perfect light finish to the heavy dinner. Portions/prices were very reasonable for the quality.\n\nI would definitely go back if I was in the area.... and I would remember to hit up the ATM before - - cash only!", "author": "Linda C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-14", "description": "If you are looking for good Italian food this is the place. I love these place and the food they served my family has been going there for the last 14 years and we never had a bad meal.

Halfway across the bridge, the McDonald's he'd had on his way out of Bayside caught up with him: soda and coffee toyed with his bladder and I was hungry so we decided to find somewhere to eat close by. Yay for the Yelp app!\n\nActually, I had neglected to notice Noodle Pudding was cash-only, and we almost missed the restaurant like other reviewers, because the address and establishment sign are inside the restaurant instead of outside...please explain yourself, Noodle Pudding. We were seated, I opened the menu, rifled through my wallet, and then waited for Scott to come back from the bathroom to ask him if he had cash on him. Back to the smartphones we went. We left without a word, and wandered back in a half hour later. The host greeted us, \"You're back!\"\n\n\"Yeah, we had to go to the bank.\"\n\n\"In Manhattan?\"\n\nThe nearest Chase ATM is at the Duane Reade on Court (the actual, ornate Chase branch on Montague was impossible to get into despite its beckoning blue ATM light). Capital One was nowhere to be found, so I paid for dinner. We tipped a little extra, because I didn't feel like asking for a 5 and singles to break my 10 in change, which is fine since our waiter acted as a living water fountain and we are very thirsty people, and service was prompt and courteous.\n\nWe cracked open the menu a second time, and realized we had little to no idea what we were looking at...and Noodle Pudding's spelling is questionable sometimes. The waiter asked if we needed some help, and I informed him I don't eat pigs or cows - he walked me very quickly through the entire menu. Once in a while, though, I delight in being boring as can be. I love a good, interesting meal, but food doesn't always have to be out of the ordinary to hit that magical sweet spot. The preamble is to prepare you for the fact that after all that, I ordered Capelli D'Angelo Al Pomodoro, otherwise known as angelhair in tomato sauce. With a sandstorm's dusting of Parmesan, I was a happy girl. This was after I ate 5/6 of the bread and olive oil. Scott was more adventurous and got the fettucine with mussels, clams, and shrimp. He was full, I had finished off my entire pasta dish, but I couldn't shake the craving for dessert.\n\nThe host found us first. Did Noodle Pudding have a dessert menu? Why yes, would we like to see it? Of course. The waiter: \"There are no pigs and cows on this menu, by the way.\" Haha, okay. We opted to split the hazelnut gelato and the espresso chocolate cake, which must have been flourless because it was closer to a delicious fudge than a real cake, rich with coffee. The hazelnut gelato was flavorful and wonderfully nutty, but I wonder if it took a minute too long to be served (or if the glass dish it was served in was still hot from its last cleaning) because it had melted along the edges more than I thought it would. We heartily enjoyed both desserts anyway, and since I am now owed a dinner, I might find my way back over here again.", "author": "Puja P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-03", "description": "Calamari is the best.
