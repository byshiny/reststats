It was extremely hot that day (about 100 degrees with at least 90% humidity) so we were in a rush to get a table. Luckily it only took us 30 minutes to get a table for two but at least they provided cold ice water for those of us waiting in line outside. Pizza was good and worth the wait.

Went to the Coney Island Location last year with my family. Although the wait was a little long... The end result was well worth the wait!! Definitely the best pizza I've had to date!!

There probably is better pizza out there that doesn't require waiting on a line for a hour, but I keep coming back every few months as a sort of ritual pilgrimage.  I like walking across the bridge and around Brooklyn Heights.  I like the decor (kitschy but not intentionally so).  I like overhearing people in line, a sort of spectacle in itself.  I like looking forward to something without it being particularly fancy.  \n\nThe pizza itself is delicious, the bread in particular.  A well done, paper thin crust.  Decent sauce, decent cheese.  \n\nSo, yes, every now and then it is worth it.  But god, you'd have to be fucking crazy to go more than once a month.", "author": "Marc T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-06-03", "description": "Jesus H Particular Christ...  If this isn't the most overrated pie ever, may I be struck down by a bolt of lightning.\n\nTo quote Homer Simpson whilst biting into a rice cake... \"Hello?!?  Hello, taste?!?  Where are you?!?\"  Another reviewer said their toppings are sparse.  I'd say they're practically non-existant.  The blandest pie ever coupled with an hour wait on a weeknight left my girlfriend and I utterly baffled as to why this place is held in such high regard.

It's totally good.  The trouble is that it claims to be the best and I simply don't think it is.  Why?\n\n- The crust was burned in places.  Not smokey.  Burned.\n\n- The sauce is too middle-of-the-road.  Its like fresh tomato sauce from a can.  While tasty, it's also inoffensive and struck me as indecisive. \n\n- Portions of the dough were soggy in each slice.  I should note that other portions of each slice were fine.\n\n- Finally, my main complaint is that it didn't taste cohesive.  Luzzo's tastes like an artistic, cohesive whole.  Grimaldi's tasted like a mishmash of admittedly solid components that added to less than the sum of its parts.\n\nI don't steer anyone away from Grimaldi's, mind you.  It's tasty, extremely reasonably priced, and a New York institution that should be experienced.  I just don't think that in this best-of-the-best category it's the front runner.\n\nSide note: this place can be like Disneyland with all the obnoxious pizza-eating children screaming their heads off and their fat parents telling them to \"shush up!\" before returning to their pies.", "author": "Juston P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-18", "description": "Stopped in on a Thursday, the wife was boycotting so I was solo with the 2 kids, host was nice and friendly from the start. I asked if there was a spot to watch the game, they had a table near a large party in the back which would have been fine had I gotten there first but I figured the group was hanging out after work and I didn't want to keep saying \"earmuffs\" so we just sat in the dining room. There was a group opn the patio, another group next to us, the place was busy enough. Our server, nice guy, can't remember his name, did a good job, didn't wait long for the greet, beer was cold, pizza took about 20 minutes. All in all, a good time, parking was cool, we walked through the lobby, not much personality from the people manning the monitors but hey, it's not like it's Nakatomi Towers right!(Die Hard reference!!!) - Can't wait to go back, you would think coming from Redondo is easy enough.", "author": "Big Reg D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-17", "description": "A reminder of why NYC pizza reigns supreme. Nearly perfect crust and a nice balance of toppings, cheese, and sauce. Most impressive of all: Grimaldi's pizza slices taste great reheated after a night in the fridge. \n\nGrimadli's operates like a fine-tuned pizza factory with pies flying out of the oven and onto your table in no time at all. Our three pies (margherita, pepperoni and mushroom, and (no cheese) mushroom and roasted red peppers) arrived in less than 10 minutes. I am always impressed when cheese less pizza tastes good -- this cheese-less pie was great. \n\nThe restaurant's interior is alive with chatter and noise; the tables are clean; and the temperature is cold (no heat as far as we could tell). \n\nWas Grimaldi's tasty pizza worth the 45 minute wait in the freezing cold and the long train ride from Manhattan? Yes . . . but only once in a while. \n\nMy all-time favorite pizza place is still Lucali, also in Brooklyn (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucali-brooklyn-3). The place has a completely different feel (slow, warm, calm) and each pie is made with more TLC and personalized attention.", "author": "Chris T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-28", "description": "My friend and I were pretty hesitant about eating New York pizza but when Grimaldi's popped up on \"what to do in New York if you only had 24 hours\" we decided we HAD to go...especially because it is right under the Brooklyn Bridge and we only had 24 hours. I can't remember the name of the soda we ordered but mine was black cherry and my friends was root beer, delicious! As far as the pizza, we had a small margherita pizza and it was very good. I've never had brick oven pizza before this so I can't say it was the best I've ever had but it was definitely worth it. Plus, it was only $20 bucks which is huge because we were already doing alot of spending. Aside from the food, the service was bad and the fact that we had to stand up to let people through was kind of annoying.", "author": "Rocio A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-09", "description": "FANTASTIC.  You'll love the taste, everything is so fresh.  You really shouldn't HAVE to wait if you get there 15 minutes before noon you'll be seated as soon as it opens at noon.   That, and going on a non-weekend day will help.  This is the place you bring your friends that want real pizza.

Really good brick oven pizza. The pie is thin and crust is crispy. Towards the center of the pizza, it gets a bit soggy, likely due to the mushrooms releasing water. The toppings weren't gourmet but it was fresh. The mozzarella used is really good, I don't know what brand they used but it is quality stuff. Pizza is light on the sauce, personally I like it. Doesn't drip and ooze as you eat nor sogs up the pizza. \n\nDrink: Poor poor selection of red/white wines and beer. However its cheap.\n\nService: None. Just because it is busy, shouldn't mean a restaurant of this caliber can't provide decent service. Be prepared to ask for things over and over again. Sometimes the host doesn't even have the decency to speak to you, just points at you and points at an empty table. \n\nCrowd: Lots of people! Come early or come late. Don't come during normal hours.

But the place is crummy inside and the servers were unfortunately an Italian stereotype, \"ey, wutch you want?\" And not in that charming sense where you're feel like they're being friendly and that's just them, but in the sense that they seriously couldn't care less just because their pizza warrants it, but it doesn't.

He said to order from the right and get a number.  I did so without hassle, and got my pizza in ~10 minutes.  Just as I was leaving, they put a sign on the door saying the line now included sit-down and take-out, so I guess once the place gets busy enough they'll shuttle everyone to that line.  Pizza was great, but we shouldn't have taken it so far to the park on a cold day (it cooled quickly).  \n\nAlso, there was a couple with a dog that had just thown up in the back of their vehicle.  The man ran inside to get some napkins to clean it up, and the older gentleman (the same guy who told me where to order) brought more out along with a cup of water for the dog to drink.

Charred crust, fresh cheese, great sauce.  HOWEVER... Service here is something that seems to be lacking so you might want to set aside a good chunk of time if you're thinking of going.  With the huge line you might want to set aside your entire afternoon.  Got there 15 minutes before they opened and the line was already forming, luckily I got in line before it got too ridiculous. Get a table, and then I end up waiting about an hour for a simple cheese pizza.  I happen to know for a fact that to prepare a pizza like that takes about 10 minutes if you know what you're doing.  To cook it in their coal oven that they claim to have should take about 5-6 minutes. Pizza isn't something you \"slow cook\" in a 1000 degree oven.  So I'm not sure what they're doing back there but the lack of service and the time it took to get my pizza was absolutely absurd.  In summary, get in the place at like 11:30, probably don't get out of there until 1:30.  Stick to Joe's or Lombardi's where you can get a slice or a whole pizza in about 3 minutes.", "author": "Ben S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-05", "description": "The pizza is good but not great.
