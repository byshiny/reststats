They no longer serve food :/ (fish tacos \u0026 wings used to be really good) Their drinks are mediocre, nothing special. This place is affordable and can be fun with a group however the crowd ranges from 20s- 40's sometimes even older which can be weird.

Very diverse,mellow kind of place in Brooklyn Historic District. I was impress with the Urban Style Bar. Atmosphere was great, loving the cool vibe. I was invited by Comedian Dave Lester for there Mo's Sunday Comic and laughed all the whole time i was there.

Good drinks.\n\nThey take care of you in there.  It's a great alternative to Habana Outpost when you're not in the mood for the Brooklyn \"mix\" and seeing everybody you haven't seen in ages and don't want to see.\n\nGotta go to Mo's Mo Mo's", "author": "Andrew C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-03", "description": "Ok the music was jumping.  The crowd was beautiful. The bouncers friendly.\n\nThe drunks at the bar not soooo nice.

I hadn't had a any drinks and was alone and I definitely look of age (full beard). I had gotten off work late and wanted one drink before heading home. This is a bar I have been too before btw... \n\nANYWAYS, the young Charles Barclay lookin bouncer looked at me and made some excuses and then told me I had to be 25 to enter. I don't think that is a thing...that's a lie. \n\nI know bars can refuse anyone but this reason was BS.

I was surprised that for a place (according to the other reviews) that turns into a pretty packed bar at night, they manage to create a very relaxed and comfortable dining experience on a sunday morning.\n\nPros: While we did sit at a more lounge type couch with low table, I was with my SO so the ability to be close was nice. There were real tables as well if that's more your thing. The food was also very good. I'd recommend the French Toast, it had a delicious hint of vanilla. \n\nCons: Service took  awhile and the wait staff was a little absent. However I was having a nice time relaxing and enjoying the drinks (our waiter also gave us a free round of Mimosas for the wait). And hey, isn't Sunday brunch suppose to be languid? \n\nAlso, there are large TV's throughout the place which were playing football. We didn't mind as the sound was off, but as we were leaving they turned the sound on LOUD. This would have been a big con if it had been on the whole time. \n\nOur total (without the groupon) for two entrees, two sides and two alcoholic drinks would have been a little over $60.  Though I think you could get away without the sides, the entrees were plenty filling on their own.", "author": "Lydia B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-20", "description": "Never again in my mother fucking life will I come to this bar!!! How do you give someone's credit card to someone else??? How??? How does that's happen?? How??? We as a group was already annoyed by the fact that they felt we were with too many men (all law abiding men) Yet, we were kind and polite!!!!

I just left this establishment for karaoke Tuesday and as I was leaving with my friends I was told next time I come I need to drink liquor. The gentleman who spoke to us was very nasty and rude!

I instantly loved the place. Something about the atmosphere reminded me of home. There were records on the wall and GREAT music playing (Motown). Went there on Memorial Day to find that happy hour was until 8 PM. 2 for $8 well drinks and $5 drafts. I was pleased. My friends and I stayed there for about four hours. It was my last night in town and Mo's made the experience great. I'll definitely go back when I'm in the area again. Good service, great prices, nice drinks.

Another miss-categorized spot as this also came up in a \"Dive Bar\" search.  Mo's is more of a hipster lounge than a bar.  As we walked through, it seemed to have a great cast of characters.  Everyone was trying not to be trying to be edgier, cooler, more stylish than the next person.  It reminded me of all the hipsters who started wearing glasses and argyle sweaters many years ago to show they were \"different\" and \"weren't trying to conform\" only to find all other hipsters were doing the same thing, which made them all the same. Very cool decor here though.

IM BUSY!\" excuse me ? her attitude was unbelievable ! i didn't even want to stay for another drink but my boyfriend insisted to ask the other bartender at the end of the bar.
