When we came in the restaurant was only half empty but we had to ask one of the busboys to help us find our waitress. Adea came by with an annoyed attitude and took my order. She came by once and never smiles...does she want to be here? I think not.\n\nFood here is a little above average. They offer free bread basket.  Food presentation is always nice actually. I had the potato cauliflower soup, a little sour but not too bad with some salt.

It's never been a \"go-to\" of mine, but it's always a nice option due to the convenient location. \n\nI went here after wanting to meet a friend and bring my newborn out for a quick bite.. the afternoon lunch date turned into a true catastrophe which was only because the food was inedible and the staff is ridiculously out of touch. \n\nHad a turkey burger and sent it back after it tasted like metal. My friends burger tasted like bacon and meatloaf... on a bun. I then order a veggie burger after being terrified to eat the meat again and it was also a pile of mush that took 3x as long to come out?\n\nOn top of the food - the staff is A JOKE - our server disappeared and never came back to check on us. Then the two hostesses were on their phones the entire time we sat at our table.. taking selfies, talking.. then one more selfie...since they forgot they were at work, I guess? The entire staff acted like high schoolers after I asked for the manager and the hostess argued with me as I tried to explain my experience to the manager. \n\nIf you're a neighborhood newbie - pass on by this disaster and if you're a tourist you'd be better off going to Starbucks for some decent service. \u200d", "author": "Lucy R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-03-30", "description": "The space and location merits 5 stars. But the food--average at best.\nI used to frequent Heights Caf\u00e9 more often in the past since it has been in the same location for years and I always enjoyed my dining experiences.\n\nDoing some serious walking (17,000 steps to be exact) today on this glorious Spring like day, my friend and I were looking to grab a brunch bite (it turned out to be a belated birthday treat for me from my friend. Sweet). \nWe adore Brooklyn Heights and I thought a revisit to Heights Caf\u00e9 was a good suggestion. With plenty of outdoor seating and a massive indoor space, we sat semi-outside or near the open window. The waitress was prompt and our order was taken minutes later. \n\nFood is standard American fare. For brunch, omelets, griddle options, salads and eggs Benedict summed it up. My friend and I both chose the artichoke, mushroom and mozzarella cheese frittata and requested salad in lieu of the home fries. Iced coffee accompanied our frittata (we had twin meals).\n\nService was attentive and food arrived shortly thereafter. The frittata was pretty good. Salad was skimpy. Overall, food was average/nothing memorable.

We saw the reviews but thought that it was kind of like the diners in New York- not rated really well but actually good. Well our experience wasn't that great. We were the only ones in the restaurant but our food took a long time to come out. The food wasn't that great. It was ok. I got the special omelette that was supposed to be sausage, peppers, and onions. There was a lot of egg and onion and very little pepper or sausage. We shared pancakes too and they were ok. It tasted like they used frozen blueberries in them. We then waited a long time to try to signal our server down to get our bill.

It is not fancy in the slightest, and it is consistent in every way possible. Servers are polite and nice, food comes out fast, and the food is good! Nothing to complain about.\n\nFood: I alternate between getting their Caesar Salad or their Cheeseburger. First off, their cheeseburgers are so dang good. I actually think it is one of my favorites in all of NYC, and that's saying a lot. Their burger patties are thick and juicy, and without fail a trail of grease will run down my hand (a good sign for a great burger). You can choose what kind of cheese to put atop your burger, and they have delicious caramelized onions you can add too. The fries that come with it are delicious as well, and you can ask for them to be extra crispy if you'd like. A Caesar salad is as standard as they come, and if you ever get a bad one, it must be really bad. I like the Heights Cafe's salad because it comes with anchovies, and I either get salmon or chicken to go on top, and sub out the Caesar dressing for a balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nService: Good attentive and fast service. They always give you a bread basket to start. \n\nAmbience: Hip but casual at the same time. Not a distinguished spot at all with very little \"character\" but is a good local/neighborhood restaurant for when you want to eat out but don't want to go out of pocket from Friend of a Farmers, but don't want to eat at Five Guys.\n\nTip: Sit outside during the summer!", "author": "Jin C."}], "servesCuisine": "American (New)", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Heights Cafe", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "84 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Gtqea5YJjWmv9-NRFz9eTQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17186255555"}
