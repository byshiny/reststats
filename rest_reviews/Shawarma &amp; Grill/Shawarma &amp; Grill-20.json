Right when we walked in, we were browsing the menu board and were immediately offered a sample of their falafel. So good!! Their falafel is almost double the size of other places' falafel and wasn't dry at all, super flavorful. I got the falafel plate combo with was enough food for 2 if not 3 meals and my fiance got the beef/lamb plate combo which was also so much food. Neither of us could finish! Everything was really fresh, not only the vegetables but my falafel was fried to order. Looking forward to going back!", "author": "Michelle N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-26", "description": "This place is new and very good!
