Peter knows his beer and its really the only bar in the neighborhood that still has a homey, non-corporate feel to it. The beer selection is impressive for its breadth and specificity, and the food ranges from ok to very tasty. I used to come here every time me and my girl would hit the cinema up the street. Now that condos have killed it -big surprise -, we hardly ever stop in anymore. Janet had the nachos, which were terrific and I had a few too many Pilsners. (Urquell) I'm just glad the place is still there.", "author": "Nick J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-17", "description": "Great beer selection, very diverse, something for everyone. The food menu is limited, but that in my mind is not a bad thing. We had the pulled pork sandwich, and it was great, with the option to have arugula salad on the side instead of fries. Good service, too. You don't need a big menu - do a few things great rather than a lot so-so.", "author": "Sofie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-23", "description": "A favorite in my neighborhood. Food is delicious, the beer selection is incredible and staff always keeps it high quality. It's a low key ale house without the dive bar/sports bar/general d-bag vibes some ale houses come with.

So last week after drinking around the DUMBO area, I suggested we go here for food.  The staff was really accommodating to our large and intoxicated group, but we squeezed together.  The food was all really good for a pub, slightly more fancy than what I expected but not very expensive.  Their beer list was GREAT they had TONS of good sounding beers.

I used to live one block away and this was our easy choice. Always good beers, they change the selection every month so you get to try a lot of different beers, good food and the best service.

Stepping into Henry Street is like stepping into a little sanctuary! The bar is warm, cozy and inviting. The beer list (both draft and bottle) is impressive, with a rotating tap of solid, craft beers (both domestic and imported) and amazing Belgian brews by the bottle (from memory, they had Delirium, Scaldis, Kwak, Golden Carolus, Duvel, La Chouffe (which I ordered), and Chimay). They also had another personal favorite of mine- Capt Lawrence Liquid Gold on tap! \n\nBartender was very friendly, though he kept forgetting to refill my poor friend's water, which was kind of annoying. \n\nI ended up ordering the hummus to soak up some of the alcohol and it was a generous portion of both hummus and pita. The other food looked and smelled very good - I would say they serve \"above average\" food for a bar of this type...it's that upgrade you always seem to get when \"ale house\" is affixed to the name of an establishment in NYC! \n\nTotal bill came out to around $60 for the hummus and 5 rounds of high quality beer. Very reasonable! \n\nIf I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I'll definitely stop by!", "author": "Stephanie H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-02", "description": "Ladies with an attitude\nFellas that were in the mood\nDon't just stand there, let's get to it\nDrink a beer there's nothing to it\nBeer, beer, beer.....\n\nIf Madonna would only return my phone calls, we could update her old hit \"Vogue\" for our generation with my new lyrics about beer.    Anybody wanting to help me with the choreography drop me a line.\n\nBack to the restaurant...Henry Street Ale House is a cool place.  There are a lot of locals who jealously guard seats at the bar so as a newcomer, I felt a little unwelcome, but my very cool waitress Joan said I could just sit at a table. She was funny, ironic, informative and a little spunky*.  I liked her so service gets 4 stars.\n\nThe beer list is well-curated, with a nice selection of bottles and drafts.  I started with La Chouffe, which is one of my favorite beers and it was served in the tulip.  Then I had the chicken wings and deferred to Joan for my next diet-busting selection.  She recommended the jalapeno poppers.   The poppers were great, served with a huge dollop of sour cream and a small bowl of buffalo sauce.  Great!  \n\nThe wings were good, meaty, with a subtle spiciness.  I subbed the blue cheese for ranch and that made me happy.  Also used leftover buffalo sauce from the poppers to add additional flavor.  Paired my meal with a Fullers ESB, very tasty.\n\nFor good service and good beer selection, I'm a fan of Henry Street Ale House.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\n*Here's Lou Grant's take on spunk (@ 2:35): http://youtu.be/sNyj4FV56JY", "author": "Bill T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-02", "description": "Ordered: bottle of Belgian beer\n\nAmbiance: low-key, dark, wooden bar and furniture, one bartender (Sunday night before Labor Day).\n\nBeer selection: good.

The River Cafe, while beautiful, was out of my price range. I didn't feel like pizza, which felt like it was everywhere. The tiny shops were growing further and fewer between. Google Maps showed me Henry Street Ale House was open. Who doesn't like bar food? If you raised your hand: 1. I can't see it 2. You should give it a shot. I had their standard burger, which was SO good. Juices were locked in, fresh red onion giving that wonderful crunch, and a perfect slice of pickle on the side. My burger standards aren't extremely high but I know what good food tastes like. I didn't take a photo because I spared no time to dive in so I'm sorry for that.

This is not bone-in chicken, rather, fresh, juicy, pounded boneless homemade cutlets, with great herbal flavoring....I think I taste celery salt? I skip the gravy, and sub out the mashed for their awesome hand-cut fries! All the apps are great as well! Try the cheddar jalape\u00f1o poppers with their rich buffalo sauce and sour cream, or the stuffed potato skins.
