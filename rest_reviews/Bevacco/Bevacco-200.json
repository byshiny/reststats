The service was horrible though! we waiting for 25 minutes for a table, without a reservation, but were eventually seated in a table that had sat empty for that entire time. I should also say that the restaurant was only half full when we walked in. Perhaps this is a ploy to get patrons to sit at the bar and order there cocktails? (which are very good and $12-16 each). After the appetizers we waited 30 minutes for our main courses watching tables around us, who arrived later than we did, receive their food before us. We had to ask for water, ask for bread, ask for our meals, ask for cheese and pepper, and we had to order a drink 3 times before it arrived. Neglectful service for the cost of the food.", "author": "sarah g."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-04", "description": "Went to Bevacco with friends and the kids to celebrate the birthday and check out @thetuscangun's cooking since he is the new chef. The owner could not have been nicer, greeting us, chatting with us and super friendly and pleasant. The same goes for Gabriele who is as authentic as it gets - a wonderful spirit and chef. I ordered his famous porketta and was not disappointed. It was both crispy and melt-in-your-mouth tender at the same time. Friends got the gazpacho which they said was great as well as the pasta. The special, a Brazilian fish, was outstanding. And the soft polenta side simply dreamy. Go support this lovely gem in Brooklyn Heights.", "author": "Andrea M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-30", "description": "A very fine restaurant with reasonable prices for a pricey area. Excellent pastas (order ravioli - even for an appetizer) and very good entrees. Lovely interior design and lighting. Good for special occasions. Maybe not your everyday Italian place unless you're doing very well.  Service was a little spotty but nothing serious.

I had the Bufalina with tomato. Perfect. Then some of us had the papardelle with lamb ragu. The pasta itself had flavor unlike anything Ive had. A friend from Rome who dined with us said it was outstanding. Then I proceed to the Tagliatelle al nero di seppia - yum . We shared the passion fruit ice cream. Heaven. Will def return.

Excellent food and really nice wait staff. The space is gorgeous-just what the Heights needs. And the prices are very reasonable. The anitpasto de la casa was enormous-easily shared by two or three people-and only $12. Wines by the glass started at around $8. We'll definitely be back.", "author": "Nick B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-23", "description": "Calamari was drop dead!

They are unbelievably incompetent, slow, confused and rude. The manager told us we were the first to complain and I had to argue with him to get him to comp something. Our entire side of the restaurant was miserable. As we watched the waiter scowl at each tip he collected as the section cleared out (our food took over an hour), it was clear that he had no idea why he wasn't getting properly tipped. The manager claimed there were no problems and all the customers were happy. He didn't apologize but instead said, \"if there was a problem, I would know about it\". Did he apologize for my drink that had accidentally been mixed with dish soap? Nope. Did he apologize for the food taking over an hour? Definitely not. The people next to us waited almost 30 min just to get their credit card back. The people on the other side had an entire table of cold food and the waiter mixed up the checks so it took them equally as long to pay. I worked in the restaurant industry for years and I can say this was absurd. The manager took a glass of wine off the check, begrudgingly, complaining about us to the waiter while we were still sitting there. SO ridiculous. The only place with worse customer service is probably IKEA or the Brooklyn Home Depot. Don't be fooled by their decor. This place should be closed.", "author": "Rachel L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-23", "description": "WOW! My husband and I were in Brooklyn two nights ago and stopped at Bevacco for dinner on a friend's recommendation - we had the most delicious, incredible meal! First, they serve fresh hot focaccia with a sun dried tomato dipping pur\u00e9e with the meal - I could have filled up on just that; it was wonderful. Then we had shared their special app, a crispy parmesan nest filled with just as crispy fried baby artichokes and just enough goat cheese to make it addictive. So good. Then my husband ordered the free range veal cheeks (we never eat veal, for all the PC reasons, but free range veal - why not?) It was so tender and melting, accompanied by soft polenta and a little raddichio flan filled with a dollop of gorgonzola. I had the langostino special - half a dozen big, super fresh langostinos served with thinly sliced braised zucchini - they were wonderful. Then, dessert! We had three -  the bombolone, a fresh doughnut (fantastic - we fought over it) the apple cake (served with a little creme anglaise, more of a deep-dish pie than a cake - excellent) and a warm molten chocolate raspberry cake, which was a show-stopper. The service was friendly and efficient, the waitstaff were informed and helpful, the restaurant itself is beautiful - we will absolutely be back!", "author": "Miranda T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-03", "description": "Espresso was ok but the service was truly horrendous.

My favorite Siciliana salad was delicious as ever, and the eggplant parm super.  Everyone else had pastas, which were innovative and tasty.  But the best was the bomboloni for dessert. Friendly, helpful service added to the very pleasant meal. We feel lucky to have this place right around the corner.

Decent wine and beer offerings. Desserts may need tweaking.\nThe SERVICE however has been a horrendous JOKE on both occasions. A \"manager\" (middle aged, short of stature in a \"suit\") was oblivious, distracted and unprofessional--downright rude when we were uncomfortable at our tables--this happened twice, once due to awkward seating arrangement another time by the cold draft from outside---despite many available seats, he was ridiculous in acting put upon by this. \nThe waitstaff appears sweet and well intentioned and highly inexperienced. Long waits for drinks, endless disappearances of any servers from the floor, then sudden over pouring of wine and courses not well staggered. The problem seems to begin with inept floor mgmt. \n\nPLEASE get this right guys! So glad you're kitchen is turning out good food but no one can keep returning regularly for that kind of service.", "author": "CM B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-28", "description": "Thought it was a solid neighborhood spot and I think will be in our regular rotation of local eateries near DUMBO. They only serve pizza Monday-Wednesday and the pasta also looked delicious. I had braised beef cheeks with polenta, and other than missing any vegetables on my plate, I was really happy with it. Husband had branzino which was crusted in crispy potato hash (a very think layer) which gave it great texture and taste. Everything was well-executed and nicely presented. The only downfall of the meal was receiving two cups of cold coffee (literally - no steam, warmth, nada) but that was resolved but kind of embarrassing (for them) I would think. Entrees are generally in the 20s-30 and appetizers around 10-12 with pasta dishes somewhere in between. I personally really like the ambiance. There's white marble everywhere with honeycomb tiles and old fashioned coffee pots scattered in random corners (another reason to be embarrassed about serving bad coffee) with thonet-esque chairs. It's a clean modern look but definitely old world feeling with the edison-style light bulbs.", "author": "Kathy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-31", "description": "place was mostly empty but when I asked for a larger table waiter said no, that was for three and we were a two sum.
