It's 21 century not a 20!! Me and my friends are not from New york and If somebody charged gratitude fee, It was usually we were big group like over 20 people but we were only 3 and also our culture is not a tipping culture If I know that one before I order I didn't eat this restaurant I was so disappointed and I forgot about really good feeling after seeing great view of brooklyn bridge", "author": "Yeon Ju K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-10", "description": "We had amazing service and great pizza, the sangria is great.

The Sicilian was more of a Chicago style pizza. Very good however, not New York pizza if you wanted that. \"The Pizza\" menu item, probably more New York style if you are looking for that type of food. The medium is enough to share with 3 people (me and two other girls) may want a bugger pizza if you eat more. Over all, nice venue near the Brooklyn Bridge and could see myself going back with visiting friends.

I don't care if anyone thinks one is better than the other, there a great things to enjoy about both styles. End of story.\nI have never tried Ignazio's thin crust pizza, so I can't tell you what it's like. I can tell you though that their Siciliana Pizza with fresh basil and a wonderful thick crust is one of the best thick crust pizzas I've had. Toasty on the bottom and sinfully moist on the inside.

I noticed that the wings appetizer comes with carrots and blue cheese dip.  I like to order carrots and dip before entrees come out in other bars and they gladly bring it out.  I asked the waitress if I can order just some carrots and dip and that I didn't care about the price.  She said that she couldn't do that.  I simply do not understand why not.  The prices for the pizza are decent considering the location.  Throughout the warm months, you can take your pizza to go and enjoy a good ol' slice, or two, or three ... along with some great scenery.  I'm a bit bothered by the \"Cash Only\".  I'm sure that many people will disagree with me but I believe that when you say \"Cash Only\" you're implying come here if you have cash, if not, we don't need you so you should go elsewhere.  I believe that businesses should be honored when customers come in, regardless of whether they are paying with cash or cc's.  There's simply no reason as to not accept credit cards in this day and age.  It's also kinda odd that the owner has a \"thing\" for octopus -- they are drawn on the walls and its also the wifi password but there's no octopus or any seafood on the menu.", "author": "Leonard G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-09", "description": "This is one of the best pizza places around. There's heavy competition around the corner (Grimaldi's) but this regular pie is amazing. A light tomato sauce and basil just makes it so perfect. \n\nLots of tourists waiting on line to get in. The only problem is the confusion of take out or eat in line outside. It's all on the same  line so if you are looking for a pie to go and there's 15 people ahead of you on line waiting for a table, you're  going to have to wait till everyone is seated  before you can give your takeout order!!!\n\nThere's got to be a better way!!", "author": "Dona F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-03", "description": "Straight up tourist location. For us New Yorkers, this is very average low budget corner store pizza. Bad crust, bad cheese from a bag probably. You'll know what I mean when you taste it. Service was ok, location is killer, so you'll get a lot of out of towner's who don't know any better. But that's what makes it very expensive. If you have pizza, get it with a bunch of toppings, because it's cardboard without extras. No real cheese( taste like bulk graded mozzarella),no real crust, no bueno!

Maybe bc I was with my boyfriend and everything is more pleasant with him around. So much so that all I noticed was the nice rustic table between us and our ice cold drinks and conversation. I think the yummy pizza was the only other thing to notice here. It's a very simple, plain shop. \nDespite the spartan appearance of the place, they do have a few nice aesthetic traditions here.... they place the pizza on a footed tray which makes it look special. I also specifically liked that they served water in a metal cup (it stayed icy the entire time we were there) and the little glass bottle of coke was cool. Our pizza took a long time to arrive but when we got it, it was very fresh and good! You can tell they use real tomatoes for the sauce. We ordered a medium pie. Called \"the pizza\" and personalized it - half olives half plain. \nIt was ....a $17 ouch... But I definitely enjoyed it. Not the ouch.:P\n\nThe service was good and if you don't want to wait on line at Julianna's which is around the corner, this is a great alternative:)", "author": "Tal O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-04", "description": "This is my first Bad review on Yelp, maybe the last.

Easily one of, if not my favourite pizza in all of New York. Now I've never had it by the slice, so maybe the full pie is better, but this place is amazing.\n\nIf you are in DUMBO and wait in line at Grimaldi's or Juliana's, you are an absolute sucker. The pizza here is better and without the hassle.\n\nI make it a point to take the ferry over from Manhattan a couple of times in the summer to grab some Ignazio's and it never disappoints.

For example, the prices are less on the online menu and so are the food descriptions.   I did mention this to staff and showed them when I was there so hopefully they fixed that.
