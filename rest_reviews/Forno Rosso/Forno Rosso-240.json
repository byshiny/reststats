If you're a garlic lover like me then you def gotta try the bruschetta.  The eggplant appetizer has the most DELICIOUS tomato sauce and the Regina with its soft, chewy, perfectly burnt thin crust is outstanding\n\nI love this place.", "author": "Alexandra S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-07", "description": "The happy hour from 4p-7p has beer, wine and cocktails.

It's a cute little place with a warm industrial feel and tucked just off of Flatbush Ave. We love that it's never overly crowded here and the service is always prompt. They have some happy hour specials (no pizzas) that are a decent deal.\n\nThe main attraction here are the pizzas. Everything is excellent (we have tried pastas and salads and desserts) but the pizza is outstanding. We usually go for the traditional margherita and the one of a kind tartufata---a white pizza with mushrooms and truffle oil and is out of this world! Absolutely fresh and delicious!  We also enjoy the arugula salad--big and perfect to share, as well as the Nutella desserts.\n\nCould not more highly recommend a pizza spot!", "author": "Amanda B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-26", "description": "Very good pizzas and rustic Italian. A bit pricy  but good service.

We did not risk to order it after the first time. I called it a \"cucumber and onion salad with a thought of salmon\"-not a well-balanced and weirdly combined dish: it came with scallions/onions (not in the description); and way too many cucumbers. \nAll 3 times that we visited the place, our server happened to be Mai. She was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and fun to talk to. She even remembered our weird requests. :)", "author": "Taty B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-19", "description": "Ate here 8/18/18. Excellent!!!!

Big open space and friendly servers. \n\nThey have a number of salads and anti-pasti on their menu but only two pasta dishes. The bolognese and the truffle mushroom. The latter was pretty good. \n\nThe star of their extensive list of pizzas was the truffle oil and mushroom pizza. Yeah, truffle oil is a sin but this worked really well with the pie. \n\nDefinitely one of the better places in the area, but that isn't saying much either.", "author": "Brian L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-15", "description": "Very good experience.  My husband chose this place to try.  Not a far walk from our hotel. We each ordered our own pizza and they were delicious. We didn't get dessert, but the couple next to us did.

Have eaten in the restaurant several times with different groups of friends. Love the broccoli rabe, tartufata pizza, grilled octopus, bread served with olive oil, friendly service. It's also surprisingly kid-friendly, with high ceilings, plenty of toddlers dining with parents.\n\nDelivery not recommended.  On Wed May 17, 2017 I ordered food delivered to a place that was just 7 minutes' walk away from the restaurant. It was for a surprise birthday party.  To make sure they had enough time, I placed the order 1 hour and 15 minutes before we needed the food.  \n\nTo my great surprise, the delivery guy was *more than 20 minutes late.* I had been standing on the sidewalk in front of the building for 15 minutes trying to see a lost delivery guy.  When we finally located him, he had been just sitting inside a car on the same street, but for some reason two whole blocks away, just sitting there lost.  He hadn't even thought of getting out of the car to look for the correct building number, or maybe typing the address into Google Maps.   WOW. If I were the restaurant manager I would have immediately offered a discount to apologize for the delay, but no such luck.  I definitely won't be ordering delivery again!", "author": "Sophia W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-02", "description": "Amazing spot with really good quality authentic Italian food.
