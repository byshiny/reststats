A relative of the extensively trained baker my friend, well aware of my predilection for pastries, suggested I should give the bakery a try, particularly for their almond croissant - an almond croissant that I can say without hesitation is the best I've found to date in New York.  Buttery yet crisp on the shell with an open and airy crumb substantial with custard-like frangipane yet not at all wet or sticky this is the sort of croissant that leaves you stunned - at least until you walk back to the counter for another because you were foolish enough to think you would share it with a friend (and end up ordering an equally impressive maple-yam Danish that puts even the best sweet potato pie to shame, as well.)", "author": "Michael U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-21", "description": "I love trying new coffee shops and was excited to try this one based on the rave reviews on Yelp (and also because this places promotes itself based on a joke of a one star yelp review \"coffee tastes like licking the wall\")\n\nI tried both the iced latte and a hot latte but both came up short in terms of espresso strength. It's a pretty weak latte and I should've taken the hint when the person ordering in front of me requested his latte be made \"extra strong\".\n\nThey were all out of almond croissants when I got there (430PM) so I was unable to try one.\n\nFor all you coffee heads, they use BQE coffee beans.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place but if you're desperate for some caffeine, this will suffice!", "author": "Rena W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-01", "description": "Their almond chocolate croissant... best croissant I've ever had?

Miche and most other breads are solid 5 stars, baguette - not quite: it lacks the contrast between crusty exterior and soft interior: the whole package is on a hard, crusty side. Most pastries are original, exciting flavor combinations. And croissants... well, mostly they are very good, unless, when they are too \"bread-y\". It has become more frequent, unfortunately. On the last 2 occasions they were also FLAT and bread-y, which is, like, a no-no in the croissant universe. May be the owners are too busy with a new Grand Central venture to supervise the croissant baking in Brooklyn? Please, train your Brooklyn underlings better, do not give them any slack.

This is the worst of Nouveau Brooklyn, over- and un-: overpriced, unremarkable, uncomfortable, and unpleasant. \n\nI have sampled croissants all over the city--they're simply one of my favorite things in life--and the croissants here were notably mediocre, and incredibly overpriced at $4 (and more) per croissant. \n\nTo the reviewer who wrote, \"the best croissants in America\"--is that a joke? It's incredibly misleading, and so incorrect as to be frightful. This is the problem with Yelp--you can't trust most people, as they entirely lack taste and judgment. New York is a great croissant city, maybe the best in the US, but I've also had worthy croissants in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago (hard to believe, I know, but its true). \n\nIn New York, the best croissants are to be found in the bakeries located within what I call the \"croissant belt\": the 60s-80s on either side of the Park, with a few satellites downtown (e.g. on Ninth in Chelsea, near Sheridan Square, etc.) who are also true artists. I could list bakeries, but wouldn't that spoil the delight you'll experience when you yourself, on your own, happen into these wonderful havens of croissant-dom?  \n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid Bien Cuit--it is an impostor. This will be one of those New York purchases you instantly regret: \"did I just spend almost $5 on a shitty croissant? What would my mother say? What was I thinking?\" Etc.   \n\nOne additional note: never does service influence my reviews on Yelp: it just doesn't make sense! Who gives a fuck about the service? We're here for the food. I hate reading the reviews that say \"Sure the food was delicious but I'm leaving the restaurant a star because of the service\"--it's the damnedest, isn't it? And confusing, because it fuddles the star-ratings of a few excellent restaurants. When I review, I'm only concerned with the food. I will note, though, that this is the type of place that staffs and attracts unattractive, sullen, and impolite white people (ill-bred) on the verge of middle-aged-ness, slovenly when it comes to maintenance of personal appearance and hygiene.", "author": "Michael M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-17", "description": "Bien Cuit is just getting worse. Downgrading based on three things:\n\n1. The croissants have gotten much worse. They used to be passable, better than many NYC croissants. Now they are mass produced garbage that somehow taste soapy. \n\n2. The bakers rage when asked if they could select a bread for me that is a little less Bien Cuit. He begins to lecture me about what a true baguette is and how amazing his are. WTF?! I can go to the bagel shop and ask for a light or dark bagel! \n\n3. The price.

I got myself an Americano ($3) and their Cassis (Blackcurrant) cheesecake and paid $10.89 in total. so I'm guessing the cheesecake alone was $6 with tax??

Fruity dessert feels lighter for the belly. Their croissant are perfect, buttery, flaky, just like how they make it in Heaven. I believe that's where they got their recipe.
