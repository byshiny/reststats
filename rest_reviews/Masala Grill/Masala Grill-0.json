The service just keeps getting worse and now the food itself has gone down with it.\n\nLast nights order was supposed to take an hour... so much for \"ASAP Delivery\". An hour later I got notification that my order was out for delivery, however waited another 40 minutes for it to get there.\n\nThat would have been okay,  if the food was hot... warm would have been good too, but it was not.\n\nCold food in greasy paper bags. And my favorite dish, grilled vegetables (parni tikka)... no vegtables!\n\nTry if you must, the food is good... don't order through grubhub... takes forever, and don't go to close to closing... that's a different story for another day!\n\nAs for me, my last time ordering from Masala Grill.", "author": "Michael M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-26", "description": "I really love this place and their food. Their chicken tikka masala is delicious. I even went to the store for pickup once. One thing that's not really too bad but noticeable - they do tend to give less rice than they're supposed to (half the container is filled) so I've learned to just order and extra rice when I order from here. Other than that their service is extremely excellent and I plan on coming back again!", "author": "Jabari A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-02-11", "description": "I ended up here because the seafood restaurant was closed. It's a clean nicely decorated restaurant. We were seated immediately and got water and the crisps. But this place took 27 minutes to serve us our entree and we were going to walk out until the food came in a Knick of time. I had lamb Bhoti with basmati rice and garlic naan. The lamb was tasty but could have used some salt, there was none in the table. There was no gravy with this meat so I had dry rice or had to mix the meat and ask for tamarind sauce. The bill was $35 and change. Was it worth it? Not really, and I wouldn't go back though.", "author": "Rhonda H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-06", "description": "Beware: the vindaloo is insanely spicy!!!!\n\nOrdered from seamless, arrived several vegetarian dishes and a couple of the daily specials (which included plain naan, white rice, entree, soup or appetizer, along with several sauces.

We enjoyed the tandoori chicken tikka as well as the chicken Tikka masala curry. We also split samosas but found it to be ehh...the green sauce is good tho. Service was okay. It could have been better. We asked for no rice and if they can substitute it with at least plain naan but the guy said no...also did not like that I had to wait and keep asking for the water to be filled..why couldn't they just leave the pitcher of water on the table?

Food always arrives piping hot and prompt. Naan is always fluffy and fresh. Really haven't had anything I haven't liked - chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo are really good. The dinner combo or lunch special are excellent values for the amount of food you get. I really like their mulligatawny soup too - very filling, hearty, and good for cold days. \n\nAn added bonus for ordering delivery here is that every single delivery person who drops by seems extra friendly. I mean, I never expect it - but it actually is quite nice and makes me want to stay loyal to them haha. Anyhow, if you need a good affordable go-to Indian spot in the neighborhood Masala Grill is definitely not a bad choice. One of these days I'll make it over there and dine-in (apparently BYOB!).", "author": "Gene L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-02", "description": "Love it here.

The food here must be cooked to order because it took about 25 minutes to get our food, hence the reason why they ask if we wanted an appetizer.

The food is absolutely delicious but the service is getting pretty bad lately. \n\nThey give me the wrong food, which is not a big deal but it shows their lack of attention.  The thing is, we were only 3 tables and they still wouldn't pay attention. \n\nEach dish is served with rice, but they didn't want to give each person their bowl. They said we have to finish one bowl first. Okay, at least it'll be warm. I try to get the waiter's attention to get the next bowl of rice, and he keeps ignoring me because he keeps staring at his phone. \n\nNo refill on drinks, he never comes to the table to check on us, I keep calling him and he doesn't even notice me.  \n\nIt's not the first or second time though. They're constantly on their phones and don't pay attention.  I understand if they're bored and they're entertaining themselves, but come on. You charge your own tip, at least don't make me hate leave you a tip. \n\nYou guys used to be so friendly and attentive.

My friend suggested the place who is of Indian decent. Out of mutual excitement to try the food I agreed. We were seated pretty quickly since the place was basically empty. We observed the waiter quickly refilled her water glass and neglected mines. Not wanting to jump to conclusions I didn't think anything of it since my glass wasn't as empty until it happened again; at this point my glass was nearly empty. Finally on the waiters third pass he filled both our glasses and of course mines was noticeably not as full as my friend's. Due to there being minimal table space while trying to shift around the dishes my fork fell on the ground, one of the waiters then attempted to place the fork back on the table. Then to make matters works while the first waiter cleaned the rice off the ground he was cursing while sweeping. When my friend requested to go plates he returned with one bag and sat it in front of her. She then gave me the bag and requested another. The waiter began to pack her food. Last, if you noticed I had to keep calling him \"the waiter\". He never introduced himself and didn't give us a customer copy of the receipt.", "author": "JR C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-07", "description": "I am reading all the reviews and I am thinking to myself now, am I really that lucky, or what?

I got butter chicken (rice is included) and veggie Samosas. I was dining alone, and at the end I had enough leftover for a whole meal later!

Really fresh, super flavorful, nicely presented and good portions.  We were a group of 6 and despite the very small space, we were easily accommodated, but we arrived for lunch shortly after opening, so I'd suggest calling ahead if your group is larger than 4.\nWe had multiple dishes but the standouts were the Lamb Bhoti omg it was....i can't even find words....it was just crazy good!! So well seasoned and grilled kabob style, this is a must have. The Shrimp Basmati rice was excellent; the fresh sliced cucumbers placed on the side are the perfect cool crisp compliment to this flavorful and hearty rice dish. Extra credit for those wonderfully herbaceous crackers they give you to snack on while you wait for your meal. Theyre complementary and come with several different sauces, of which the tamarind was my favorite! I could never stop eating those crackers and dip; they were such a delicious surprise!! \nThey get a minus for the iced tea; I was expecting something that represented the food, something full of spices/flavor, but it was just plain old powdered iced tea. And the Mango Lassi was more like a pi\u00f1a colada, so beware it will not quench your thirst and will make you full.\nBut this place is about the food! And there's this chicken dish that's served on a sizzling cast iron plate that I MUST have next time!!!", "author": "Tiffany I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-29", "description": "This is very good Indian food.  The portions are actually big enough that if you order the Daily Special, it feeds two.  (Or it's enough for two meals if you live alone.)
