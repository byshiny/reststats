Service was great both times I went. Reasonably price for the portion sizes. \n\nI experience the oatmeal and a green juice one morning. Both get two thumbs up. For lunch I had the salsa kale bowl . It was so good I went back another day to order again. It was fresh and light with lots of zucchini black beans corn and kale. You can add chicken and or tofu. The second go round I ordered the tomato soup which was ok it wasn't my fav though. It had a great spice to it which I loved. They also have pre made options like tuna salad chicken salad a few other salad options with lots of juice options. \n\nThe only think I didn't like was that they have salmon listed on the menu and done actually have it anymore. \nI was so thankful this was right next to my hotel.

I would always go to this location because it's the closest to my house. However, lately, I've been thinking of going to the one closer to my job. At this location, the staff are not friendly, the food that is out looks old and the place is not always clean (no matter what time or how many people are in the shop).\n\nAlso the way the staff present themselves is not welcoming either. Often the music which appears to be chosen by the staff is too loud or inappropriate. \n\nI love the juice shop and will continue to support it but at a different location.", "author": "Denise C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-05", "description": "Juice Shop is a gentrified juice and smoothie bar with healthy options including salads. Their products are overpriced in my opinion, but coming from someone that makes their own smoothies literally on a daily basis 1-2 times my judgment may be a little skewed. Still, forking over more than 9$ for an almond smoothie - as delicious as it was - was a little hard to swallow.\n\nAll that aside, their options are inventive and seems that top quality ingredients are used. The space is clean and there is plenty of seating available. I'd return, but maybe a customer discount-loyalty program is in order unless people have 10$ to shell out on some almonds, plant milk and peanut butter blend.", "author": "Michael W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-04", "description": "YOU HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE IF YOUR CLEANSES ARE LEGIT! ! ! I've been SHITTING ALL FUCKING DAY! I've never shit this much from juice so you're definitely adding laxatives to it, no doubt. This is fucked up! I understand what cleanse means, I do, but people name juices all sorts of shit, doesn't mean it is what it says. Cleanse could imply that it's just cleansing my body by taking in greens! Wow  nice... no you spiked that with laxatives and name I'm at work shitting all day. Please want people. \n\nOn the other hand the juice was great and it looks like they have a lot of nice stuff there. I will be back, but don't be a dirtbag, don't put laxatives in peoples drinks. I've drank juice before, that's not my first time, there was no reason I should be shitting the way I am. \n\n \nEdit:\nStopped in today for another Kale Cleanse! No crazy shitting, which is good, but an awesome drink nonetheless. \nHowever, I accidentally left my Tuna thing on the table and I've been trying to call all day to hopefully get a credit but no one has answered. The phone just rings for a minute or so then disconnects. Very unprofessional to ever have a phone unanswered. I'm hoping they can see this and help me out the next time I go there because that tuna bowl looked really good and I'd hate to look out on $8 or so. \nUpping the star count from 3 to 4 on account of the food and the people behind the counter.

It's a little on the expensive side for what you get.  Why I'm giving it 3 stars is because the service is hit or miss.  I waited about 15 minutes today after ordering for a PB\u0026C Acai bowl.  The store was a little busy but the line was never more than 1-2 people, so I don't understand why it took that long. It looked a little chaotic behind the counter with the staff trying to juggle orders.  The bowl was also just ok - I prefer when acai bowls have flavors like peanut butter added that they add the ingredients in layers, so you can still taste the acai.  In this case it was all blended together so the bowl was like a think peanut butter shake with some granola, berries, and half a banana on top.

I wanted to like this shop, with it's healthy offerings and airy space. But I found the juices and smoothies SO expensive for what you get. Today I tried a kale bowl and wow, I finally get why people hate on kale. If you eat it this way, you will not like it. The bowls are expensive and don't include the protein, which you have to add separately. The dressing didn't work with the pad Thai bowl I got and neither did the toppings.\n\nThe only saving grace were the fresh ingredients.

I had placed an order for delivery to my workplace in which I was working at the time but instead of him coming into the establishment and asking if anyone ordered; the delivery boy consistently called my phone and was yelling at me. When I told him to come inside because I was still on shift, he came and tossed my order on the table. He even dared to try to instigate this situation further by placing the blame on me for not answering my phone. I know I put the correct address on the order so it really isn't much of a struggle to just come inside and ask if anyone ordered instead of yelling at me.\n\nThe part that really saddens me is that when I tried contacting this place to complain about the delivery, they so happen to never be around to answer my calls.

The place appeared to be overstaffed and not one worker took the time to make my drink. The price is decent and fair for the quality of the food but how they represent themselves as workers I wouldn't trust them.

Yesterday, after getting my yoga on, I needed a snack and decided to try the \"Cool it now\"-it was hot and I could immediately hear the song in my head as I ordered so it seemed like the right decision.  Ten bucks later-jeez, that's what it usually costs to get all the ingredients I need for like 3 or 4 smoothies at home- I walked away with a delicious really well balanced drink that really hit the spot and left me with a feeling of well-being : ) very refreshing as the name implied. \n\nService was friendly and quick, juice was delicious and expensive.

After the menu change I was already disenchanted with the place (considering they got rid of some of their better kale bowls and started selling poke bowls as if there aren't already entire other establishments dedicated to that). But this particular location always seems to be a bit unprofessional staff wise and doesn't seem like a good environment for having a meal. When I stopped in today, they were playing music so loud it was literally painful to stand inside the entire time to wait for the food to be made. Makes me wonder if they actually don't want people sitting down inside. And as for the food, it's been a little more disappointing each time I've returned. Either to try new menu items or revisit old ones. I ordered a kale bowl today and swapped the sauce. The sauce was LOADED with salt  (and traditionally it should be refreshing) and the bowl I had was drenched in the stuff leading me to pick out the less drenched portions and toss the rest. I didn't have time to go home and rinse off the leftovers and salvage the remainder of the bowl. I hate writing a review for like this since I used to love this spot.

Went in with a friend who treated me to my favorite Mediterranean Kale Bowl with Chicken. When I got back to my apt the salad tasted of tuna. I walked back to the store and was promptly asked by the cashier (who at this time happened to be the manager and not shift supervisor as she stated)  what was wrong. I informed her that I order a chicken kale bowl and this had tuna. Maybe I got someone else order. She never tried the salad in front of me. All she told me was that our \"tuna\" doesn't look like this. I said ok, well somehow tuna was in my salad. Maybe it was from the tongs, the bucket, or just the wrong salad. Can you just make me the correct salad. She then went on with well it's going to be just like that so do you want a refund. I remind her again that my friend paid for lunch and wasn't sure if he paid cash or card. This is when Rasheda (the \"Manager\") dismiss me and said well we can only give a refund to your friend, there nothing I can do for you, leave before I call the cops to have you removed. All of this happened in front of all of her staff, who instead of directing them to work as there was now a line of 6 people waiting. I asked her for her name, emp ID or a number to corp. She never gave it too me, I had to get her name from another employee.\n\nThe service at this store by the manager (Rasheda Andrews) is horrendous! She also yells at her staff in public (witness the day before as she was scolding her male employee over a previous customer complaint) by the door while she was sitting directly across from a customer who was trying to enjoy their lunch.\n\nWhat has happened to this location?
