I was put in touch with Dan who was very helpful in helping me to come up with a small catering platter. \n\nDecided to go with Chicken Kebab / Shawarma, grape leaves, sultan dip and falafels for about 15 people. The food got there just on time \u0026 was fantastic. \n\nHighly recommend this place. Amazing food for a reasonable price \u0026 great service. Definitely returning.", "author": "Mike L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-11", "description": "So glad to have discovered this hidden gem. The food tastes fresh and was incredibly delicious! The place is BYOB and has a very cozy backyard. We ordered 3 appetizers- greek salad, spinach pie and moussaka. For entree we shared a seafood dish with couscous. Everything tasted freshly prepared and perfectly seasoned. The only thing that needs improvement is the dessert. They didn't have most of the items on the dessert menu so we ended up ordering baklava, which we could have definitely skipped as it just was okay and too dry for my taste.", "author": "Tai M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-20", "description": "Awesome takeout tonight.  Got the mixed grill and mixed appetizer plate for 2 for $27 today.

I had a really lovely dinner with my partner! We ordered the sultan meze which included the best falafels ever,  delicious cauliflower, really smooth and tasty hummus as well as the eggplant dip which was really delicious! I really enjoyed the tahini dip and the warm pita that they provided! As for entrees, my partner had the chicken kebab platter which looked sooo good!! I however had the chicken tagine and found it average. I thought it would have included more flavor\nand more vegetables rather than just potatoes. I was also looking forward to trying out couscous..Anyways, we both really enjoyed everything about the restaurant and will definitely come back once again soon! Also do try the mint tea!", "author": "Miriam W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "This is my go to for delivery but I thought I would pay them a visit for a change. They have some tasty falafel that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only complaint; the grape leaves tasted like they came straight out of a can. Tasteless and soggy. The pita could also use some help too. \n\nThe service is always warm and inviting but I think I will continue to make this a delivery only meal.", "author": "Thomas M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-16", "description": "Very good Brooklyn Heights restaurant with typical Middle Eastern and Moroccan dishes.  Started with appetizer of five nice sized falafel balls which were delicious but served with a too bitter tahini sauce on top.  The meat pie was filled with delicious seasoned meat and onions but, again, that bitter tahini on top kind of ruined it.  Ordered the Moroccan meatball tagine with a side of couscous which was very good and served with warm pita.  The lamb tagine was equally good.  Service was helpful and friendly if a tad slow.  Prices are reasonable as well.  Would come back and recommended.", "author": "Anthony G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-26", "description": "Food was not good at all. The couscous was not original, extremely thick semoule. Service was not good as well, extremely slow, only one waitress was taking care of the entire restaurant. If you want a real couscous you should go to caf\u00e9 mogador in Williamsburg.", "author": "Alexandre G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-25", "description": "The falafels were moist, and the hummus was plentiful.

We ordered mint tea, lentil soup, mezze platter, and babaganouj. They started us off with warm pita with a side of hot sauce and tahini. We ended up with a complimentary dessert.

The food was excellent, the ambience was comfortable and relaxed, the prices are reasonable/low, and the service was attentive.
