After a long week of vacay and eating out there sandwiches made for a simple supper. Had the Brooklyn bridge sandwich and the roll it was served on. Oh my word! Soft and delish. Also stopped there our first night of vacay and had the chicken kabobs and schwarma. Very tasty! Service was friendly and in addition to the food we also purchased some water and snacks to keep in room to avoid having to pay $3 bottle at hotel. Def walkable from Hampton Inn and encourage a visit.", "author": "Julie E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-02-19", "description": "They open 24/7. The food is subpar but the fact that they are open all the time is a plus. It is more on the expensive side. Prices are comparable to manhattan after all this is downtown Brooklyn. Ordered a turkey wrap for $7. The turkey meat was standard but tomatoes were sour. Added a ton of mayonnaise without me asking. Service is good though. They make the food quick for pick up.", "author": "Irene L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-19", "description": "Great staff very helpful.

If you want to order something from the extensive menu, it's often easiest to order by number which is easier for them to identify. The quality of the sandwiches is pretty good, especially considering the fairly low prices. You can walk out the door with a hot sandwich in under 10 minutes!\n\nDon't forget about the 10% discount on deli items for college students, and free delivery for orders over $10. \n\nGold Street Market offers surprisingly upscale food items (fire-roasted poblanos in a jar? cambozola cheese?) and most items are definitely more expensive than they might be in other stores but that's the premium you pay for convenience and 24/7 access. The deli prices are still very competitive though with most hot sandwiches costing between $7-$8.50.", "author": "Nick H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-13", "description": "Avoid like the plague. Came here for lunch, fought my way through HS students, and had the guy behind the counter make me wait 15+ mins for one beef patty. He kept giving it away to people who came after me, and then told *me* to *relax* when he kept doing it. Then, he gave me a *microwaved* beef patty which disintegrated upon touch.

Fruit is typically available and of good quality. \n\nEmployees are very kind, and in over a year of patronizing the market (several times per week), have never experienced hostility from any of the workers. \n\nThe fact that it's open 24/7 is a huge plus, especially for those who live nearby and want to grab something quick.", "author": "Richard C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-01", "description": "Best deli Ive been to in NYC. So many sandwich and deli choices at a great price. Fresh produce, salad bar, and a daily hot bar for lunch. Cookies made daily and take online order and delivery.

This used to be my favorite deli until today. Bought an ice cream that was expired here, so I had to go back to the deli for a refund but the manager never apologized, saying the ice cream is only few days passed why I was making such a big deal about it.!! So I asked for a refund. The ice cream was $7.49, he paid $7.50 cash and told me I owe 1cent with an attitude.

Amazing. It's about time too. \n\nI read up about this place on my building's blog and immediately went over. The first thing I noticed is that the two ladies working behind the cashier are super friendly and greet each and every customer. The second thing I noticed was that they had chicken and waffle lays + garlic cheesy bread lays. I have been looking for those for AGES. \n\nUnlike other bodega's in the area that shall remain unnamed, this place is much cleaner, and their produce looks fresh.

Their sandwich wraps are way too expensive and takes way too long to make. Also the lady at the counter will get mad if you try to pay with card, as she accepts cash. I am not sure if she is pocketing the cash, but that's not my concern. She just yells at me when I want to pay with my debt card and demands I pay with cash.

Their menu is a pretty standard list of sandwiches, wraps, and paninis. The execution is fine, nothing to complain about but nothing to rate about either. \n\nTheir biggest draw is that they are pretty cheap and offer a discount to students.", "author": "Christopher R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-17", "description": "Very extensive menu for everyone.
