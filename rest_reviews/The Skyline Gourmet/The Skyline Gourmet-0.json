It's located in Downtown Brooklyn. Overall, it's the best deal in the area that has seen wave of gentrification within the last decade (10 years). Everything is the that area (Downtown Brooklyn, NYC) is incredibly expensive - from Chipotle to Metro Caf\u00e9, Pot Belly to Panera Bread, and finally, Five Guys to other misc. restaurants/fast-food establishments. The reason [   Skyline Gourmet Deli    ] is such deal is because they've kept their hood prices relatively aligned with \"hood prices\" even though the neighborhood has changed drastically.\n \nFries and Sandwich range less than $10, and compare to other establishments offer the a similar deal, [ Skyline Gourmet Deli  ] beats them because of the quantity of food. No longer would you be disappointed or hungry for the lack of food,  [ Skyline Gourmet Deli ] offer an incredible portion to satisfy even the hungriest of individuals.\n \nAnd for the more health conscious individual [           Skyline Gourmet Deli] has not forgotten you - they offer salad at non-competing price points; a salad at Metro Caf\u00e9 (same ingredients) will cost you $10.00. At [    Skyline Gourmet Deli   ] it'll only cost $6.75 with a bottle water included, thus, achieving a healthy meal and hydrating at the same time.\n \nToday, I purchase one of my favorite items from [  Skyline Gourmet Deli   ]; the Philly Cheese Steak on a hero (only $6.00). OMG!!!!!!! [pause for mouthwatering effects] The Philly Cheese Steak is the mecca of this establishment - the caramelized onion, the green peppers, the thinly sliced steak covered in the classic American cheese (disclaimer: I think American Cheese is America's worst creation), and finally, the item bring this tasty, heaven sent bundle joy, the Italian bread (yum!!!!!). \n\nIf you're in the area check out Skyline Gourmet Deli.", "author": "Darrel F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-31", "description": "Got food poisoning from this place TWICE, the food orders are always wrong and breakfast is usually undercooked.

Ordered food with specific directions to leave dressing on the side. Deliver it dripping in dressing. Call the place to have it changed and they refused to do so and tell me there is nothing to done.

I don't know what inedible frankenmeat they actually shoved into that oversized marshmallow they called a roll but it was a frightening bright red and full of gristle--exactly like that crap my high school cafeteria told us was \"ham\". Since I didn't eat it back then and certainly wasn't about to eat it now, I was out 8 bucks. Why do they pretend to sell something decent if they have no intention of actually doing so? Do they think we can't tell the difference? Also, there's nothing \"gourmet\" about the place. They probably should stop calling it that.", "author": "Marie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-28", "description": "Over priced store and orders take extremely long.\nI bought 2  croissants egg white, little onions and cheese and paid almost $15 because they charged me as a full omelette (EACH).

Really disappointing food. Their egg sandwich was alright (even though they didn't toast the bagel like I asked) and their hash browns were pretty good. But their chipotle chicken salad sandwich was awful. The roll was small and there was a tiny amount of chicken salad on it so the sandwich overall was not filling. The chicken salad was super dry and not flavorful. Also, I asked for plain chips and they gave me salt and vinegar chips, which I hate. Won't be ordering from here again.", "author": "Amy R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-19", "description": "I go to school nearby and this is my go to place for breakfast lunch and dinner!

It's an \"in and out\" deli. By that I mean you order your food, get your food, pay and get out. They seem to be fast, efficient and reliable. The prices are matched with other places nearby and the quality of food is better than most. \n\nYou can order through Seamless and/or Yelp for much faster service. If you order online there is also no minimum. \n\nThey have a prepared menu you can choose from or create your own. They have a $6.00 minimum for credit and debit cards which is also average for the area. \n\nThe cashier staff is also friendly and efficient.", "author": "Johnny F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "Gourmet deli food? Hmm sounds pretty good, right? I had their chicken culet and cheese sandwich. The chicken was hot and crispy but the bread was saggy by the time I ate it. The sweet peppers give the sandwich extra flavor but I wish they have added more cheese, lettuce and tomato, it wasn't enough to balance the peppers.", "author": "Alicia C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-20", "description": "A good lunch spot!

The owners are nice but the guys behind the deli counter are miserable and confused.  To be fair it might be because they don't speak English very well.  I ordered a $6 Triple Decker B: Roast beef \u0026 Turkey w/cole slaw \u0026 Russian dressing.  Here's what I got: 3 slices of staling bread, 2 slices of roast beef, 2 slices of turkey with cole slaw on the sandwhich instead of on the side, as is the usual.  The place has just renovated so it seems cleaner and brighter than it did before but it looks like they're serving less for more these days.\n\nTo be fair their breakfast meals are great if the guy behind the counter gets it right --which is a 50/50 chance in my experience. Expect a line in the mornings and during lunch hour so it may take 5-10 minutes to get your food and go.  \n\nThe place is also frequented by some very interesting neighborhood characters!", "author": "L A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-29", "description": "Just lost me as a customer.\n\nI've been coming here for over a year and the employees were always very polite. Today I got a foul smelling and awful tasting bottled soda even though it was previously unopened and not their fault. Their politeness disappeared when I told them about the situation and suddenly criticized my taste and said there was nothing wrong.\n\nI was confused because they seemed very friendly when I stop by and as a frequent customer, I would think they would be a little more lenient and understanding. I guess their true colors showed. Goodbye Skyline.
