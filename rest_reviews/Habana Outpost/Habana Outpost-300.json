Tho, I must say, WTF is up with their security. Like, come on, this place is not that amazing that there needs to be 5 giant scary security guys manning all the doors.\nCOME ON.\nAnyway, fun chill casual atmosphere that gets super busy when the weather's nice. Right near the C train (which is good during the day, but not so great at night since it SUCKS).\nFrozen margs were tasty, but let's be real, they came out of a machine and they don't hold a candle to Blockhead's $4 margs (these were $8). So it was fun and good, but honestly, nothing compares to you Blockheads, love of my life.\n\nDidn't try the food here tho, and I'd like to so perhaps I'll be back to try it.", "author": "Alex F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-09", "description": "The corn was amazing!

I went there this past Thursday and was the food was cold and the corn was skimpy:( I mean SKIMPY!!!! \n\nWhat was really shocking is that we ordered a beef and chicken burrito. We paid $5.00 extra for the chicken so imagine my dismay when we received a PLATE of cold chicken!!!:(  I told them that we wanted the chicken inside of the burrito and they said \"we don't do that\". I mean, \"you don't do what, sir\"??? We paid for a beef and chicken burrito but you won't put the chicken INSIDE of the burrito because you \"don't do that\"??? Soooo...my boyfriend ate a plate of cold chicken along with his cold burrito.

As far as other dishes, I can't remember that much except that people liked the catfish burrito, and I remember liking the corn. But the ambiance was very nice with the outdoor seating, and the food pick-up area resembling an outdoor food cart despite it being a brick and mortar restaurant.\n\nIt makes me feel like I am in Cuba.

I ordered the chicken quisedilla and I forgot what my husband ordered.... anyway...\n\nIt's very different than what I'm use to. It's a restaurant with a \"fast food\" style of ordering. There's a menu on the wall. No waiters and u sit wherever u want. That was disappointing. There's basically a food truck attached to the building. So u place your order insidr and pick up your food outside and then sit where u want. We wanted to sit outside but all the tables with the umbrellas were taken. I didn't want to sit in the sun. It would have been nice if all the tables were shaded. So we opt to sit inside. The decor is a mess. It needs a makeover badly.\n\nBut what they lack in decor and service, they make up in food! The food was sooooo good. The portions aren't large. It's just enough to satisfy. Perfect for lunch.

I knew it was going to be good when I walked in and George Michael's \"Father Figure\" was playing on the PA system. This place has great music taste, which is an underrated part of many restaurants, and it continued through the night. I was craving a Cubano so I had to order it along with the sweet plantains. I was in the mood for Cuban food. The one mistake was that my brother recommended I get one of the fruity alcoholic drinks: a mango mohita. All I could taste was the alcohol, not the mango. I originally wanted the mango fruit drink but since I wasn't driving anywhere, I figure alcohol isn't a bad idea. Oh well. Live and learn. The food was really good. The Cubano had swiss cheese but I could hardly tell from the taste. Plus, the sandwich was the perfect size, not too small but not too big so as to become heavy. It was filling too.\n\nEating outside was a good choice. It's a little chilly, but there's a little more color; a sense that the city is alive outside the walls of the restaurant on the outside instead of the inside.", "author": "Henry T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-12", "description": "Steak taco, Pork taco, Mexican corn, chicken and waffles on a stick.\nWhat shined through the most in this meal was the steak taco. Meat cooked to perfection, and seasoned to perfection in a good old Mexican-style taco. \nThe Mexican corn was good as well along with the surprise item on the menu which was the chicken and waffles on a stick. Unique in every way, my first chicken and waffle dipped in maple syrup experience was a good one to start with. The contrast of the salty chicken along with the doughy waffle dipped in maple syrup to combine the sweet and salty taste was nice to say the least.\nFor the steak taco alone, I will go back.
