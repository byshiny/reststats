If you're ever craving anything familiar and comforting at inconvenient hours of the night (or if you're one and a half beers in from your night out???), this is the place for you. They serve the usual diner fare- pancakes, waffles, fruit, and a whole bunch other selections.\n\nI was here at 3 AM craving for something crispy and greasy. We ordered jalapeno\u200b poppers ($12) and their sampler, which consisted of mozzarella sticks, zucchini sticks, a few pieces of buffalo wings, and chicken fingers ($18.50). They make the food fairly quickly- I think we were waiting for about 10-15 minutes or so. There were plenty of dipping sauces included in our takeout bag! \n\nThe jalapeno poppers were delicious! They weren't spicy like I thought they were going to be- it tasted pickled instead. The outside, which was perfectly breaded and fried, tasted amazing. An overall fantastic appetizer. :- ) The sampler was huge!!!! There were so many things to try. The mozzarella sticks were delicious- and once again- perfectly breaded and fried- and the zucchini sticks were no different. I think the zucchini sticks were my favorite since they were straight to the point- light, not too heavy, and didn't feel like I was consuming too much oil. The buffalo wings were super spicy\u200b but flavorful both inside and outside. Its exterior had a great crisp to them.", "author": "Anna X."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-18", "description": "A very solid three stars for this 6pm breakfast food diner meal that I had whilst *not* being even slightly intoxicated. (100% serious.)\n\nI figured I'd try this place out after having glossed over it many a times because it doesn't stand out too much from the outside, but I'm always down for some french toast and breakfast potatoes (maybe or maybe not at the same time -- no judgments here).\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the eggs benedict and I had the challah french toast and ham (and my boyfriends potatoes) and I thought it was actually pretty good. The french toast were fluffy inside and slightly crispy on the outside, as all good french toast should be. I even tasted a hint of cinnamon which is a major plus. The ham was ham. It's hard to mess that up I guess. And the eggs benedict, my boyfriend says, was fine. Nothing spectacular and not really worth the kind of high price for a diner. But, we both agree we'd come back and absolutely agree that it's a solid 1-3am option as well, if that's your kind of thing.\n\nThe inside is cozier than most diners, but that doesn't actually mean it's cozy. It's clean though, and I'll absolutely take that any day.", "author": "Kaley R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-03-04", "description": "Your basic diner. Lots of options to choose from, good prices, open tables on a busy Sunday morning. The food itself was good but nothing special and we were never offered coffee refills.

Both simple dishes. \n\nWe were shocked when the food finally came out.... it was truly disgusting. We politely called the manager over and kindly expressed our disappointment - especially with the unsightly $14 tuna melt - and instead of offering us something else or trying to mend the situation, he rudely swiped the plates away from us. We couldn't believe it.\n\nDon't go here.

They also was watching the World Cup which was great lol . They have seating in the front and in the back is like outside indoor seating it was beautiful but me and mom sat at a booth . I ordered a turkey bacon feta and spinach egg white omelette and also a toasted blueberry muffin . The omelette comes with toast and home fries . Everything was delicious the omelette was perfect and flavorful the home fries well they were home fries can't go wrong with that . My muffin was also pretty delicious the only thing about it was it was so big that the butter didn't get to all of it lol but it was delicious nonetheless . Like it was previously stated do not think of this place as a bougie place or a place with a awesome aesthetic . It's a diner a clean diner with excellent diner food and for great prices at that.

Not only is the food super cheap, it's also really good and great amounts. I hardly ever finish my food. There pastrami sandwich is to die for. And I think they make their own pickles which aren't too bad either. I am a huge fan of their coleslaw even though it has raisins in it it still has a great flavor. Every time I go I try to get the same waitress not sure of her name but she's awesome! I also love that they are extremely accommodating and personable.

It is the only diner in the neighborhood that does it, and they are exactly as advertised, a classic diner. If you need an omelette at 3am, they've got your back. If you need french toast or a greasy burger to absorb some alcohol after going a little too hard, you can count on them.\n\nI've been there for brunch, and I have to say, they're not really up to snuff with competition like Cafe Luluc and Miriam around. It's just classic diner food. Don't come here with your high-falutin' Brooklyn expectations of farm-to-table non-GMO house-made artisanal creations. Come here for plain old fashioned americana.
