Three comments:\n\n1. The food is very mediocre.\n\n2. The people who work there are dour, rude, and obnoxious.  Crappy service with an attitude.\n\n3. I saw roaches on the wall.\n\nLook.  There's \"LA Style Burritos\" a block away.  The guys are nicer, the food is better, and I never saw roaches there.  If you have a hankering for Mexican food, do yourself a favor and walk past Buddy's.  Go to LA Burritos.

Buddy's may have just about the worst guacamole ever, but I ordered a Brooklyn Burrito recently and it was pretty okay. It was way better, in fact, than the burritos I've had at California Taqueria, which has been my cheapo Tex Mex fast food go-to joint for months.\n\nIt's still not great, or even very good, but for New York fake Mexican food, Buddy's will do just fine.", "author": "Abigail S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-09", "description": "I must admit, I've only had one thing from Buddy's (basic gourmet burrito with shredded pork), but in my defense it's because this is the best burrito I have ever tasted in my life and I can't bring myself to order something that might be less delicious. You must try it.\nOne negative, their guacamole which is supposedly \"all avocado, no filler\" is a GROSS mis-advertisement. Quite the opposite, it's all filler, very little avocado.

You can't go wrong with their Brooklyn Burrito, and C. reports that the vegetarian burrito is also solid. They're relatively big, so prepare yourself for a filling meal. (I can barely eat the whole thing.)\n\nThe chips and salsa make a nice accompaniment to whatever you order, and be sure to try the lime Jarritos. It's a Mexican soda, and I recommend it. One disappointment. They don't serve horchata at Buddy's.

Most of the time the standard answer is that you can't in New York City. Be careful that you're not asking a Californian transplant, or you really won't want that earful.\n\nAnyway, I'm from Tennessee and I've lived in Texas. So that means I know tex-mex better and I'm no purist anyway. Buddy's does something great, which is cooking the meat to order. My husband consistently gets a chicken burrito and it's almost as big as his head. That means it fills him up, folks. I waffle between getting chicken nachos and trying to be healthy and getting a meat platter (I did once try a salad too). OK, Buddy's is pretty serviceable. If you're hitting up the movies later or you're just hungry and you don't want to break a $20, go to Buddy's. Now if they'd just slice that freshly-cooked meat into more serviceable pieces we'd be really cooking with gas. I'd say this place falls more on a Cali-Mex or Tex-Mex style scale of \"Mexican cuisine authenticity\" but please, it's Brooklyn. It tastes good, it's fresh and it's fairly inexpensive. I'm not complaining about having this option in the hood.

I even heard the cashier ask the \"cook\" if there was any cilantro, in Spanish. He also said no. Well, fellow cilantro-haters, it does. Enough to make you feel sick. Why lie about something like that to your customers??? Or if it wasn't intentional...how do you not know what's in the food you're serving?
