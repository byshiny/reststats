Yummy vegetarian options (i get the garden rolls, salad and tofu sandwich).  Super cheap.  If you don't like your teas too sweet - ask for \"half sweet\" or get the Jasmine Bubble Tea.  Oh - call ahead because even if there isn't that many people in there, it can take a while to get your order.  Probably due to all the other customers calling ahead : /", "author": "Danielle M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-28", "description": "I was glad to find a place where I can get a rice vermicelli salad in Brooklyn. That has to be one of my favorite meals. After getting and eating said salad I was a little disappointed, not as good as Quang in Minneapolis, but overall I'd say it was good and I'll be back. The spring rolls and iced Vietnamese coffee were both very good.", "author": "Ben S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-22", "description": "Two stars because the staff was friendly, the food is cheap, and I think the place has potential, but the three times I've been here, it's failed to impress.  Not enough veggies on the Bahn Mi, and the bread leaves a lot to be desired.  The meat was tasty, though.", "author": "David B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-02", "description": "Finally, a place to get boba tea in Brooklyn!  I used to love getting it back in LA koreatown, and now I don't have to take the D into china town just to get it.  I just had the grilled chicken sandwich today and it was really AWESOME.  They have a couch in the back which is really comfy, and yes, it is VERY stroller friendly.", "author": "Gia R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-25", "description": "No two vietnamese sandwiches are the same!

I loved this place. The bread they use for the sandwiches is really great, and I enjoyed the bubble tea I had. I recommend the classic sandwich. I look forward to coming back here next time I'm in the neighborhood. Actually, I'd probably make the trip just to revisit this place.

I eat it a lot in many different places. But I have never had banh mi like this. The spicy classic is a thing to die for and the spring rolls (minus the peanut sauce, but adding the hot sauce) were fresh and wonderful. The iced coffee was just the jolt I needed for the pick me up of ther day. Too bad they don't sell pho as well - they'd have to do that well. ;-) Hungry?

The bread is fine, but the vegetables are often sodden.  And nothing is reliable, save for the spicy classic.  By contrast, all the sandwiches at Ba Xuyen are worth trying.  And don't bother with any of the shrimp or summer rolls, either.  Limpid and nothing special.", "author": "John B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-21", "description": "i cannot believe that i've not yet written a review of this place. \nit's delicious. and that's what i have to say about it.\noh, and they're fast!", "author": "jessica l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-18", "description": "Excellent, just damn good vietnamese sandwiches, fast service, cheap prices, fresh ingredients.
