The service was friendly, but my boyfriend objected. Our waitress did seem too occupied with the staff there dining in our whole section. I guess there was some sort of party? The booth across from us was very drunk and belligerent. I had overheard a conversation of the woman in the booth with her children yelling and cursing about coworkers doing things. I'm not sure if she's a manager or an employee, but that's totally inappropriate and especially in front of her children and others around.\n\nAfter we had paid, the manager at the time came up asking how everything was. We said it was fine because it felt particularly awkward after our waitress had already apologized for us being in the staff section. \n\nI had to use the women's restroom before I left. There were children playing in it and one of the stalls didn't have a lock. I ended up using a different stall and noticed there were feces smeared all over the toilet seat while someone was doing business very loud in the stall next to me.\n\nOther than all of this, the margaritas were great. Food was mediocre. Sadly won't return again even though the building looks amazing.", "author": "Autumn R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-11", "description": "The service from the bartenders to the waiters to the hostess is friendly.

ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT COME HERE. AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AT ALL COSTS. My dad ordered \"the Korean\" taco and because of that meal he is currently bed-ridden with FOOD POISONING. The food was mediocre, lacked ANY flavor--and there was not a trace of \"Korean\" cuisine--overpriced, and was CLEARLY not prepared with fresh ingredients. This restaurant is an absolute disgrace to the Brooklyn Heights community and should be shut down immediately for serving such poor quality food.", "author": "Sae Rheen K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-06", "description": "Chain style Mex. is a cute central spot with some hits and misses, though it's hard to go wrong with Mex.\nAte:\nSpicy guac\nSeafood mocajete\nThis downtown Brooklyn joint is huge!. The guac is made table side which makes a good show \u0026 although it was spicy it was otherwise unremarkable. The chips had an awful spice to them, unlike the hangin' fresh ones at Vario 408 in Park Slope.

I was more excited when I saw thy offered brunch with unlimited mimosas. \n\nWhile I would love to say my experience was stellar, unfortunately I cannot. For being a table of four and the only table our waitress had, as the rest of the place was pretty desolate, our service was shoddy at best. We all ordered our drinks and meals but 10 mins later, still no drinks. It shouldn't take that long for small glasses of mimosas to be made but we all let it slide. Our food did come and while two of the four of us liked our food a lot the other two literally hated theirs. The waffle and banana pancakes were the losers of the group, which we all laughed a little that they did likely make bad choices ordering classic breakfast food at a taco restaurant. We all looked past this though and just kept drinking our mimosas. Cut to receiving the bill, we noticed we were charged for two side of eggs at $3.50 each. My fianc\u00e9 did order eggs so we mentioned to the waiter we were charged twice. According to the waiter the charge was correct... they charge $3.50 PER EGG. Now I know NY is expensive but really?!! Literally nothing was said and we walked out after paying but I can tell you those expensive ass eggs will live on in infamy with our group and I can promise my fianc\u00e9 will never step back into a Rocco's again.", "author": "Jennifer R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-18", "description": "Overall great Mexican food. I visited here on Friday with a friend visiting from out of town. Service was a little slower than we'd have liked but the restaurant was packed and the environment was lively. I ordered nachos that were very flavorful and juicy. Honestly, they are loaded with toppings and probably my favorite that I've found so far in NYC. The 1/2 order is more than plenty of a portion for one person and priced very appropriately at $9. \n\nIf you order tacos, order ala carte. It'll save you some money and they are just as delicious as the trio that costs you a lot more money. My friend loved the steak tacos and thought the meat was tender and flavorful. The chicken taco was nothing special - a skip for next time.", "author": "Jessica L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-17", "description": "Great Atmosphere  and the Taco Tuesday is CRAAZAAH!!! I LOVE IT!!! Sangria, they have the best in BROOKLYN!! Isabella is a beautiful courteous waitress there who is quite cognizant of the food and drinks when we were indecisive and she was right!!! The Nacho's, Shrimp Taco's and the Black Beans were BUENO!!! The Sangria too wash it down is exquisite.. Not that costly but again the good things in life are not on the dollar menu but I know some beg to differ LOL!!!!
