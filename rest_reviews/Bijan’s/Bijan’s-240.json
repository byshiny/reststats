I've ordered delivery and sat down to order, both were still delicious.\nDefinitely get the steak frites. When those squishy fries fall into the flavorful juices seeping from your medium rare steak and soak up the seasoning and meaty goodness into their potato-y bodies like a sponge, you'll be glad your ordered that dish.\n\nThey are super good at brunch as well. $15 for an entree, tea/coffee and a cocktail!", "author": "Jenny A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-25", "description": "Great little neighborhood joint.

The waiter was rude, inattentive, slow, and charged us improperly.\n\nI went with four friends for my birthday lunch and cocktails. The server was Jam. He seemed to make new rules about the menu that I have never had before: he wouldn't bring ketchup for each person that asked for it and charged us for extra blue cheese. Also, we were doing the buy one get one cocktail happy hour and when we ordered the second round he informed us that you had to order the exact same drink as the first round (again, I have been here many times and never witnessed this rule; all the classic drinks were the same price, and they weren't rung up individually so it shouldn't have been a problem. Also, he should have informed us of this rule before we ordered our first round). Additionally, the drinks were unstrained and the ingredients were so thick that you could not drink it through a straw.\n\nAlso, he was so slow and inattentive. Instead of coming to the table, we would have to flag him down or go to the bar. When we asked for water he kept bringing new glasses and not clearing the empty ones, so we eventually had over 20 cups on the table and no room to move. I had to go to the bar to ask him for the check, he then spent 20 minutes talking to a customer, and then my friend had to go up and ask for the check again (we were also not the only table to have to do this).\n\nWhen we got the check, we asked to split the bill. However, he decided to charge one person over $10 extra for gratuity. The menu says that there will be an automatic 20% gratuity added for parties of six or more. We had five people. We pointed this out to him, and he said with an attitude \"oh the menu is wrong, we should fix that. But, just so you know, 20% is standard.\" My friend said that we weren't that happy with the service. So Jam said: \"Then you shouldn't come back.\" \n\nWe were all taken aback by how rude and condescending he was. I have worked as a waitress before and would never say that to a customer.This is especially disheartening because I love Bijans, I enjoy talking with the other bartenders, and it's usually my go-to place when I have someone visiting. However, now I don't want to bring people there because I don't know if the experience will be great or terrible because of a nasty server.", "author": "Rebekka D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "The kind of place that used to be more common in the neighborhood.

Reasons for that are as follows:\n\nA) cost effectiveness \nB) for the health aspect of it\nC) I got fed up with a lot of mediocrities of food a lot of these restaurants are serving\n\nI am so happy I stumbled into Bijan. Usually I find fault in a lot of food and think to myself, \"how could I possibly make this better?\" \"Could I replicate this at home?\" I don't think I could for any of the food at Bijan. Everything was flavored perfectly, cooked perfectly and most importantly - what I found most impressive had clean flavored. My cousin and I went on a Friday night and it was packed. We ordered the wings that had this sauce that was so complex and delicious. It was a combination of buffalo wing sauce and some sort of Asian sweet and sour taste that was just out of this world. Their eggplant and garlic mezze was delightful but alas myself being a garlic feen would've added more garlic. My cousin then ordered the lamb burger. It was reminiscent to me of Turkish kofte in terms of flavor. Delicious! It is served with sweet potato fries that are seasoned deliciously and with parsley. Sweet potato fries came mandatory with the burger. Restaurants take notes! Sweet potato fries over regular fries any day. \n\nAn interesting star of our evening was the pickle-tini. A martini with your choice of either gin and vodka with cornichon pickles and pickle juice. It was so clean and deeeeelish. I ordered two. \n\nThe prices at this joint are great as well. I can't wait to try this place for brunch. It's been awhile since I was impressed by restaurant food.

The atmosphere is super low-key.  The semi-rustic and open space made it feel like I was sitting in someone's backyard or garden.  Our drinks were delicious and reasonably priced.  I ordered the Gingerita and loved it.  Everything is made with fresh ingredients so it wasn't overly sweet and didn't taste artificial.  I also stole some herb fries from my friend.  They were heavenly.  I have to admit, at first I was disappointed when she didn't order the truffle fries; however, that disappointment quickly changed to joy when I tasted the herb fries.!
