Walking in, I was already super in love with the layout \u0026 aesthetics of the place. Everything was a bit pricey. \n\nI take my coffee and drinks on the sweeter side so I decided to get a small hot chocolate. It was more bitter than I expected and a lot smaller than I expected, definitely not worth the price. \n\nWhen you order in, you'll get a number \u0026 food will be brought right to your table! \n\nWe got the B\u0026E roll without tomatoes and the avocado toast with a poached egg. My egg was a bit over cooked so the egg was not as runny as expected, and there was a bit too much lemon/lime squeezed on top so I had to scrap off and/or mix the avocado spread. Nothing too special so again I thought it was a bit overpriced. Took maybe 5 minutes for the drink and 10-15 for the food (we ordered in). \n\nTips: bathroom is located in the back behind the flamingo wall, no cash just card accepted, sizes of the drinks are on the side of the bar facing the tables, and once it gets busy the tables can seem very close to each other. \n\nOverall: great service, cute aesthetics, pricer items on the menu, and more on the bitter side of things.", "author": "Allison T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-19", "description": "Pros: loved the chai latte!

It was a little crowded but we were able to find a seat easily. The place is quite spacious. You have to order at the counter and get a number to put on your table. I love the concept of this cafe and love the different types of toasts they serve. \nWe ordered the salmon with cream cheese and dill toasts and the fig Jam toast. Both were delicious and were quite pricey for toast (about $10-15). It's hard to justify paying so much for toast. I do like the minimalist and blue decor. The cafe gets a lot of light too so it's very bright!

We were hungry and wanted a chill place to eat and grab coffee as a pre-workout meal and found this place while walking to the boxing class (right next door to shadowbox). The interior is really cute and if you download the Bluestone Lane app, you get a $5 credit that you can use (definitely worth it to download it). \n\nThe menu has a variety of different food items as well as drink items. Although it may be a bit pricey for my taste, I was VERY pleased with my food. I got the ricotta and berry fruit toast. It was only one piece of toast but the flavors were absolutely delicious and I kept wanting more haha. But without the $5 it's on the upwards of almost $9 which was a bit...crazy for a piece of toast LOL\n\nAnyways, despite the price, I genuinely loved everything about this place.

It's a chain and known for their Australian coffee and while I've liked their other locations, the Dumbo one stands out more for some reason. That's not easy considering how many hip coffee spots are in this neighborhood. Bluestone has a chill inviting vibe and ample space and yes the good avocado toast, served on a thick slice of bread with oil and a healthy portion of smashed avocado (additional toppings optional).", "author": "Lana V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-08", "description": "The dirty chai only available for dine is what I dream about! Very clean and nice environment. My friends all enjoyed their coffee and tea as well. A couple in our group was from Australia and were excited to see some authentic menu items from back home.\n\nWe did not eat here, so I cannot comment on their offerings. \n\nGreat spot to warm up after walking the Brooklyn Bridge (NYC to Brooklyn)\n\nDisclaimer: I went to another location in Soho and was greeted with: We are out of ice!

There are both outlets and wifi for doing work. The wifi unfortunately wasn't working too well when I went, but that might have just been a one time thing.\n\nThe drinks are Aussie-style down to the \"iced\" lattes having actual ice cream in them!

The place was nice and bright and welcome respite on a rainy day. The service was excellent as we received cheery smiles from helpful staff.\n\nBut don't go for brunch here as there's not much of a selection. The food was good but rather pricey. I got an avocado toast by itself and maybe I should have asked for poached egg or bacon or something to go with it coz I almost choked on it towards the end as I couldn't swallow the last bite. It was pretty overwhelming after if it's plain. I mean it wasn't bad and it had a spicey kick that I liked, but I think my husband makes better avocado toast so I don't know if it was worth it. \n\nI had a Bloody Mary to to go with it and it wasn't the best, felt kinda watered down but I guess it works.
