This is the kinda \"Mexican\" food you eat at an Irish pub in a Mormon town. Their $9 queso fundito is a small cup of nacho cheese that is of the type you get at the 711 out of the machine for 99\u00a2. The food was blah. \nThe receipt made no sense. The waiter told me the only sauce was cholula. Had to get a different waiter to get red and green sauce, that wasn't worth the wait. \n\n$17.15 and change for 3 tiny tacos, cup of canned cheese and a Diet Coke. \n\nNever coming here again.", "author": "Clint G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-13", "description": "Wow this place was pretty bad, the only thing that met expectations was a bottle of beer because you can't screw that up.\n\nI ordered Queso Fundito and received a bowl of cheese similar to what I expect to get from a baseball game.

I've tried the chorizo, the beef and the carnitas too, but pork is the best out of three.\n\nTo be honest, there's no consistency with their food or their service (especially when eating in). I've had times when the pork was killer. Other times, parts of the pork were super dry. The rice and beans are pretty good as a side (but far too large of a serving, I'd share). \n\nDelivery is speedy. I dare say, you may have better luck ordering via seamless vs. dining there. Yuca fries are another favorite along with the chips and salsa. \n\nCheap and cheerful.

If I lived nearby, I would definitely want to be a regular here. \n\nOur bartender was John, and after some questions about the menu, we decided to go with the Cadillac Margarita. As somebody that drinks often, this was strong. A couple of these would be enough, which at the $14 (IIRC) price tag, makes it worth it to not have to order multiple drinks to be able to feel anything.\n\nWe arrived after dinner, so we didn't try the food, but just based off the ambiance, service, and drink, I definitely look forward to coming back to experience more.", "author": "Michelle C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-06", "description": "Guac is barely one avocado browning... no salt or lime.

That's what I ordered, kind sir. Our wait wasn't too long, however, the inside is small and was PACKED and I'm glad we got outside seating. \n\nPROS: Good food, good drinks. Extensive menu. Reasonably priced. Outside seating for dining in nice weather. The Pedro's Margarita is a refreshing mix of sangria and margarita. Wings, spicy and come with a chipotle sauce \u0026 blue cheese.

All you have to do is make sure my margaritas are strong and my chicken quesadillas are delicious and you provide extra sour cream. That alone can give you 5 stars, and that's what I started to rate this place but let me tell youuuuuuu...\n\nI came here on a double date just to chill and have some drinks. We started with a pitcher of patron margaritas with blue curacao which was a good bargain. I think in total we were able to get 12 small drinks out of that (or maybe I was the only one who had 3 drinks). I ordered the chicken quesadillas with extra sour cream and my date ordered the shrimp tacos WITHOUT the chipotle. The other couple ordered the same dish, which I forgot the name of. ANYWAY! So the bus boy brings out my quesadillas and I ask him \"are you sure these are mine\", just off the strength that it was the only meal at my table ready to be served. He said yes and I let it stay on the table without touching it because 1. I wait for everyone to have their food before I eat and 2. I just knew that plate wasn't meant for me. Longer story shorter...the plate was meant for the table behind me. After 5 minutes of sitting on my table the waitress just took it off my table and placed it in front of the correct diner. WHAT?! She didn't even ask me if I touched it nothing and that just rubbed me wrong. The shrimp tacos came out with chipotle on it...figures. The bartender was good at making strong drinks but he took FOREVER to make them. \n\nDon't forget that this restaurant is tiny! I'm 5'11 so I had to bend low a little. I used the bathroom and it's so tiny that when I washed my hands my butt was turning off the sensor for the dryer lmao way too awkward.\n\nAll in all, the food is typical mexican food and the drinks are good. If you're looking for a chill time then come here.

I mean the house is located in Brooklyn, where all cool things happen and the cool kids play. My experience was far from cool, but not awful. Maybe average, OK, decent...bottle beer was five dollars. YAY.....\n\nStop by Saturday night after a visit to West Elm. Wanted some beer and a bathroom break. While the place was busy, I was not impressed. Lighting to bright and decor had that I was something else years ago, now I am a Mexican Restaurant. Very boring look for the festive look of a Mexican Restaurant.\n\nTheir selection of beer was standard; Bud, Corona, Heineken, etc. I had a Corona; it was cold with a lime and I like that $5 a bottle price. The area dictates a higher price point, but I think this is one of their drawing points; cheap beer.\n\nOverall, if you are in the area and need a beer Pedro's Mexican Bar \u0026 Restaurant has a niche.
