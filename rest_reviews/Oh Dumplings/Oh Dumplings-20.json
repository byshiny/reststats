A great take out place. The dumplings are good but the filling could've had more taste. The bing was good but not as crispy as I hoped it would be. It's still a soft opening so there's room to improve and make it better, just glad for some more Asian variety aside from Thai in the area.", "author": "Tracy S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-19", "description": "most authentic \u714e\u997c jian bing in the city, hands down.

Great location. Great for takeout. The vibe inside is a bit flustered and awkward as it's just a soft opening but I'm sure the neighborhood will keep going. They need to get some music playing in there though! Make it more comfy for their customers waiting for their meals. The dumplings were so yummy. We also got a crepe thing which was good but I could have eaten like 20 more of those dumplings. Delicious!", "author": "Abigail H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-27", "description": "Everything was cooked fresh in front of us!  Very quick.  We had the cucumber salad, chicken\u0026celery\u0026mushroom dumplings, pork spicy wontons, and then the lamb bing.  Very flavor and the szechuan spicy oil was great!  I have nothing but good things to say.

The food itself was quite good. The wontons were delicate and flavorful, and the chili oil had just the right amount of heat-- numbing but not overbearing. As all the others have said, the service is a little slow as the kitchen is small. I probably would avoid peak lunch hours, etc-- but if not too crowded, I recommend stopping by!", "author": "Sarah G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-15", "description": "Ordered rainbow set to taste all their dumplings.

Why claim organic chicken or grass fed beef when you are filling the dumplings with imitation crab! Bland taste and thick dough.\n\nAlso very dirty cooking space.", "author": "chris m."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-26", "description": "I thought these dumplings were absolutely delicious. Super flavorful beef dumplings with a little bit of beefy juice/soup that exploded out when you bit in to them. The bing was well cooked and had good flavor. The chili sauce could have been distributed a little more equally through the folded crepe, but whatever!\n\n My actual favorite was the cucumber \u0026 mushroom side salad. It wasn't too well marketed on the sign board -- it is called \"fungus\" there rather than \"mushroom\". I think they were 'wood ear mushrooms' -- also not sure if that name is better. In any case, that's some real Chinese food like my mama makes. Would highly recommend giving it a try - the tangy vinegar helps offset the heavy bing + dumplings.\n\nEco-friendly takeout materials :) \n\nStopped by on a Sunday night and had maybe a ~10 min wait to order and get my food. We were not in a rush (and totally understood, since the dumplings were being fried in the background / we watched the bing get made).", "author": "Iris Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-13", "description": "Been here twice now and both experiences were great.

They were substantial where 8 chicken ones filled me up quite a bit. The dough is really good as was the filling.
