The food was very tasty, the ambiance was really nice and they were really reasonably priced. We got fried rice, calamari, summer rolls, and a curry and all of it was presented well and large portions. What's not to like?", "author": "Quinn Li O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-03", "description": "I've never experienced such poor customer service at an establishment. We were standing in front of the hostess stand for 10 minutes when I said excuse me to an older Caucasian man with a Bluetooth ear piece. He was very unwelcoming, mumbled something under his breath and tossed the menus on the closest table. We noticed that he did this with multiple patrons. When our food arrived, we asked him for napkins. He lifted his index finger to us and continued to punch numbers into a calculator. He gave us the impression that he did not want to be bothered by paying customers. When my apple salad arrived there was a big piece of plastic wrapping in the salad covered in salad dressing. When I asked to speak to the manager, the waitress went up to the same Caucasian man with the Bluetooth headset. He rolled his eyes and refused to come to the table. The waitress returned to the table and apologized. She said it was the plastic wrapping that the greens were wrapped in when they were delivered to the restaurant. (So does that mean you guys aren't removing the lettuce from the wrapping to wash it prior to serving it?) The salad was removed from the table and our bill but the manager never came to the table to apologize. I would never eat at this restaurant again. There are so many other local options. The food wasn't even worth the terrible treatment.", "author": "Fernandez X."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-23", "description": "Food is delicious. Atmosphere is Chic. The prices are very affordable. Perfect for a first date, which you want to impress but not to spend an arm \u0026 leg. You can seriously order an appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 cocktails, and dessert for around $50. Love this place. Been coming for years. They used to be all-cash but now they take cards, if I'm not mistaken. \n\nPS.

The light fixtures were fascinating. I like their open kitchen where you can get a look . . . . oh who gives a hoot. \nTried their fried calamari which was decent. I'm not a seafood fan so decent is high praise coming from me. Boyfriend wanted it. He got it. He loved it. I ordered a Thai tea and fried tofu with vegetables in a green coconut curry. Thai tea was delicious. Perfectly sweet. The curry was ok. Not awful, but not what I had expected. It was not very spicy at all. Actually I was expecting it to be a lot hotter that it was. I actually got the tea because I was expecting a very spicy dish. It was also a little too salty for me. Most of the vegetables was bamboo shoots. I was expecting more of a variety of vegetables. BF got basil chicken. It was so salty. And way too much sauce. Uhg it probably brought sky rocketed his blood pressure.

Tiff and I sat in a table in the back. We shared a tom yum soup with shrimp, fried tofu, a papaya salad, and chicken Pad Thai. The food was good. The soup was large, semi-spicy with large pieces of shrimp. The papaya salad had a lot of shredded papaya, carrots, lettuce, and tomatoes. The taste was on the sour side with a light level of heat. The fried Tofu came our golden yellow color and we got an accidental dumpling which was quite enjoyable. The pad Thai had a brown color with nice sweet citrus-y flavor.
