Definitely not in the West Coast! For the best you have to come to this pizza parlor!\n\nIn my frustration eating at awful pizza joints, I reminisce of the best pizza from my childhood and I am basing this review on my experience 35 years ago when I frequented Fascati's.  This was when the borough was grittier and before Brooklyn became trendy.  (If I had a dollar for every ball team these days with a girl named Brooklyn on it...)\n\nI went back to Fascati's 5 years ago and they did not change, although the patriarch was no longer there, but fortunately the baton was passed.  I checked in with my bro who is still in Brooklyn, and happy to report Fascati's is still strong.\n\nYou will see them hand twirl and shape the dough. The crust is thin and not burnt.  The sauce is tangy.  The amount of cheese is right on.  No avocado or fufu toppings, since a well made pizza will shine regardless.\n\nI read reviews of the slices being pricey now.  When I was a boy, they were 75 cents.  Though The Wannabe Ramen Snob came from humble beginnings, he got a taste of the American Dream and would be happy to pay $10 a slice!\n\nNow if I can only find a Yelper to agree to freeze a Fascati's pie and send it to me in California...", "author": "Ray C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-04-07", "description": "Ordered stuffed shells without any red sauce because I had just got my teeth whitened and could only eat white foods. When I got my $12 dish, it was so small. It had maybe six shells and sauce less than halfway up the side. When I called to complain that it was small, they were unapologetic. They seem to have no ethic about giving value to the customer. Yes, their pizza and food is yummy, but I told them we would not be frequenting their restaurant often like we used to.", "author": "Siobhan G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-27", "description": "I've been coming to this place since I found it in college. Lived nearby and was hesitant because I am a picky pizza person, but friends of mine convinced me and 10 years later, 2 moves out of BK, I still find my way back to Fascati. Jeff is awesome, as is the rest of the staff. The food is amazing! Cant stress that enough. Im not going to rant and rave although I should because I could go on forever about how good this place is but you get the point! 10 years and Im still a fan.

The menu said the garden salad with chicken would be 6$ and each meatball sub would be 6.25. I find that the subs were each 10$ and the salad was 11. The salad was tiny and had cardboard tasting chicken. I called the restaurant to tell them I was overcharged and the manager (or whoever answered the phone) called me sweetie which I find sexist and gross and he told me that anyone can post on the internet. I would have asked how much it was going to cost when I was on the phone but he hung up before I thought of it.

But Fascati is completely unpretentious, serves up fresh slices, and they're pretty damn good. The square slice was my favorite, but they also do a ricotta slice.

I always get a \"square\" and a \"slice\".  Usually the \"square\" wins, but today the \"slice\" was perfect. It was thin, evenly baked, but still had a chewy-ness, well distributed cheese, tangy red tomato sauce and it folded just right, down the middle and had just a drop of red oil run off.
