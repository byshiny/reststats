With a warm and cozy atmosphere, I went there because I heard so much about it and wanted to grab a bite to eat before the play I came up from DC to see at the Kumble Theater. The wait staff was friendly and professional and the waitress we had was a class act! Tasha brought out water with ice to the table, but proceeded to bring an extra glass of ice to keep the water cold. Very nice touch! When our food arrived, it came to the table piping hot and delish!! I ordered a veggie omelette which was very tasty and nourishing. Came back later for the famous cheesecake after the play. Loved the original with strawberries, but wished the crust was made from graham cracker crust. Not sure what crust they use, but I didn't care for it. Other than that, the food was good comfort food. When I'm back in Brooklyn, I'll be sure and stop through again!", "author": "Sondra L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-13", "description": "Finally tried the famous Junior's on a trip to NYC.

Burgers very good, fried chicken excellent, avoid the cheese steak.  The wait staff very nice for NY.\n\nI strongly recommend eating at Juniors.

Once we got back to the house, some of his friends came over, and when I offered them some cheesecake, they all were like \"nah, I already ate and I don't like sweets\" or whatever, but when they found out it was Juniors cheesecake, these grown **s men ate up all my damn cheesecake like they were some starvin children!  \n\nBy the end of the night, I was actin like a fool, \"where's my 3 cheesecakes!?!\"  I was so mad!  But when everyone left, my friend showed me that he hid a few slices of each kind in the back of the fridge.  I guess they always act like piranha when it comes to Juniors...\n\nMmm, can't wait to get back to the east coast and get some more!  In my book, it's the best in the country.", "author": "T T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-26", "description": "Eh, it lives on its fame, the cheesecake is great but the food here was just ok.

I prefer a graham cracker crust but the lemon cake bottom was very delicious!\n\nI also ordered a key lime pie, which is my favorite dessert, and it's TERRIBLE .. the custard was thick and heavy and gross .. it wasn't tart at all .. the only thing good about it was a thick graham cracker crust ..\n\nProbably 10 minutes after trying a few bites of both, I had uncomfortable stomach pain and dashed to the bathroom and ... well you know what happened!\n\nDon't know which one made me sick, but one of them did! ):  Next time I\"ll try each separately and I pray it's not the cheesecake .. because I love it so.", "author": "Anvy A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-13", "description": "I liked Juniors. It delivers what you expect with ridiculously good service. Bonus points for authenticity and music.\n\nFood- 3.5 Stars\nBreakfast was fine nothing special. Omelet's were fine, home fries as well.

We split a Pastrami sandwich and a piece of Strawberry cheesecake.  Sandwich was a little small and OK but nothing great.  Cheesecake was good and obviously the main draw.  Understand that prices probably need to be high here to maintain operation and possibly for rent but not exactly a value.  Odd behavior by waitress in that she insisted on handing me the check vs just leaving it on the table, then she was insist on giving it back to me was it once it was run with credit card and pointed to area where I needed to sign and leave tip and waited for me to tip and sign.  Was a bit odd in that I have never experienced that before and place wasn't busy so they weren't doing it to quickly turnaround tables.

Had Junior's ever since I was a child. Have faithfully ordered their triple chocolate cheesecake with chocolate chips on the inside as well as the strawberry cheesecake. The prices are expensive but rightfully so!
