The Regina Margherita was heaven. Crust is thin and perfect, the creamy tomato sauce, mozzarella, and I added prucciuto for a ridiculously amazing pie. The only complaint is the Bloody Mary, which had basil in it, which was very unusual for me, but I still sucked it down. They topped it off with a complimentary Nutella pizza that was mind blowing and such a treat.", "author": "C.
