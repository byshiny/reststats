I came here to try the duck pad thai which I've never seen on a menu before. There was plenty of duck and the portion was large and very reasonably priced  ($11 for dinner).  It was on the spicier side as opposed to a sweet pad thai. The noodles were quite thin. The staff was extremely friendly and there is plenty seating. The neighborhood is fun and makes a great date night place because you can walk around afterwards.", "author": "Tony T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-28", "description": "As an update to my recent previous review, they CAN make the curries with soft tofu (instead of fried), and I love it! Makes me feel so much better about what I'm putting into my body.\n\nI have also had the shiitake roll, and shiitakes are one of my favorite mushrooms, so it makes my taste buds and tummy very happy to have this as well.\n\nI doubt there's much else on the menu that I can safely eat (aside from a couple of the other vegetable-only rolls), but I love both the red and yellow curries so much that I'm totally content on ordering one of those each time I go.\n\nAlso, they provide some complimentary fresh fruit at the end of the meal. It has usually been cut up oranges, but they gave us watermelon slices on the most recent visit, which was nice!", "author": "Barbara C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-04", "description": "I'll preface this review with a note that I USED TO go here many times as it's close to work. That's before I lost trust in the restaurant that I wasn't being cheated. \n\nHowever, I recently went here with two others, and while the food was decent, the reason for the one-star review was the completely unacceptable way we were treated by the staff. Having chosen this restaurant for the evening as we had gotten a Groupon deal, we had fully intended to use it. Unfortunately, we found out that the staff were completely unwilling to accept it, citing reasons not included in the fine print to invalidate it (that the third person got an item not covered, even though the Groupon was for a dollar amount for two, and the other two people did get valid items OVER the dollar amount). \n\nIn short, the food is fine, but don't count on this restaurant to honor any agreements with an outside partner. As a note to management, if you're going to work with Groupon, make sure your staff knows what's in the fine print and get a manager to help if they don't. That way you won't lose customer trust.", "author": "David Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-15", "description": "Good fresh Sashimi for the East coast. \n\nWhite wine was served Luke warm. I like the idea of the patio in back, but was too warm to try. Only problem with this place is the lack of commitment to Sushi. They serve so many other options it is hard to understand why...

It was advertised that the back patio is open for diners.\n\nWe went straight to the back patio which was well put together with summer flowers and plants that compliment the restaurant's motif.\n\nThe tuna don that I selected tasted good and the fish was fresh. It was adorned with wooden boat and sake jar. It was also served with miso soup and vegetables salad with ginger dressing which is standard in any Japanese restaurant.\n\nThe staff are attentive yet unobtrusive. I was given a nibble and cold bottle of Kirin light as soon I got seated. I will definitely comeback here in the future. My only qualm is the unnecessary over adornment on my sushi plate.", "author": "Reggie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-05", "description": "Great first experience ordering delivery from this place. I've walked by their spot on Montague St hundreds of times but never bothered to go in or order from them for some reason. \n\nRecognized the name on yelp, and decided to give them a try. Food was delivered quickly, efficiently, and most importantly, with a smile! The food all seemed prepared with care and everything tasted perfect, which is sadly a rare feat for delivery.

I ordered a few rolls for delivery and they were really delicious.  Very interesting rolls and for a great price.  The White Snow Roll and Brooklyn Roll were my favorite. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is for the chicken pad thai.  The dish didn't taste anything like the traditional pad thai that I am used to.  There were slices of somewhat slimey chicken, a few slices on green onion, minimal egg, and a little pile of peanuts.  The flavor was just off, very off!

The food is very good. The staff is super attentive in a very pleasant non-intrusive way. We had the crispy duck salad- very fresh and crispy. The pad Thai with shrimp had a bit of a kick to it. It was yummy but a bit spicy which some people may not be prepared for.  We have been here a couple of times with the Groupon deal (including this time) and plan to come back again. \n\nThey also give you some refreshing slices of orange after dinner.

So you need to order or go into Saketumi for a couple of different  reasons. 1. Delivery service and or dining service is super quick (like always) 2. Delivery person or waiter/waitress is always super friendly! 3. (For delivery) They package everything up really securely and nicely. 4. The food is always super hot a fresh and delicious!!!

I'm always down for a \"Thai Food Outing\", and this place definitely satisfied my taste for Thai. Upon sitting, they offer a moist toilette and a glass of water. The waitress allowed us time to review the menu and then returned to ask about our beverage choices. She gave a great suggestion for Sake, and brought our drinks promptly. As shown in the pictures, the food presentation was excellent and matched the taste. We had sushi appetizer platter and also the sashimi appetizer platter, which was fresh and taste. The main courses came out in a timely fashion and the server checked on us throughout our stay.

Excellent service.  We sat outside at first,  beautiful,  but my son got cold so the waitress happily moved us indoors.  She was very friendly.

Their lunch specials are amazing, especially the bento box-it's a great deal! Their prices are right and it's a filling meal. You would think that because they serve a variety of asian foods that they might not taste good, but everything I've had here has been good.\n\nI would highly recommend the teriyaki bento box for lunch, comes with shumai, two pieces of california roll, a salad and a soup. The teriyaki itself comes with great portion of vegetables too. Also, I can never finish the rice.
