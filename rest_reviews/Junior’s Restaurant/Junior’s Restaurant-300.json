We didn't get to have a piece. Because we sat in the front section which was the caf\u00e9 area and they only had two servers... We didn't get half of what we ordered and what we did get we had to wait an hour for... And of course it was cold. Next time I'll just go get the cheesecake online and have it delivered.", "author": "Kris L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-04", "description": "I had business in downtown Brooklyn and afterward decided to stop at Juniors for a bit of refreshment and a pick-me-up. I sat at the counter and ordered cheesecake and coffee. But this wasn't an ordinary piece of cheesecake. Juniors offers an array of cheesecake that surpasses any chain cheesecake restaurant. I ordered the red velvet cheesecake. It was a thin layer of moist, delectable red velvet cake topped with an entire New York style cheese cake and on top of that was another layer of red velvet cake topped with a thick layer of cream cheese icing. Needless to say, this was not a low calorie treat. It was delish and I had coffee with it. It's also quite possible to take half of the cheesecake home.\n \nThe waitress was super attentive. I wanted milk, not the half 'n half she offered. She quickly got me a small pitcher of milk. She refilled my coffee cup three times and also refilled the milk pitcher.\n\nJuniors is a 50s style deli with hustle and bustle. One of the managers asked me how I enjoyed my meal. I've eaten there before and that's kind of standard for them. They ask. The cheesecakes are incredible. Other baked goods are very good too. The food is diner food.", "author": "Nike C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-05", "description": "I live in Brooklyn. Expected better from this location.

That's a bold claim... Rare for folks to make it but even rarer to live up to the hype.  I don't even like cheesecake, but this was amazing.  A thin doughy crust perfectly complements the thickness of the cheesecake above.  Strawberries as big as your head pile high above the cake and the combination of it all takes you places.

Cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, pie... Delicious. \n\nAll the portions are generous. The omelettes are gigantic. There is a lot of corn beef hash. If you don't  want the entire pancake order, you can ask for a single pancake.

Went to this place after a terrific show in Barclays only to ruin our experience with disgust! Don't get me wrong, place was packed but quality and cleanness were questionable at the least. Table was sticky and smelly as if the fresh vomit was just wiped out. In fact that was the smell of the entire restaurant!? Yack, but we were super hungry and ordered their \"famous \" sandwiches, I had turkey with coleslaw and beef tongue, both came dry and stale, slices of Swiss cheese looked like a year old at least! Drink overloaded with ice and tasted as dish washing detergent. Pieces of food scattered all over the floor.

My family and I came here, a group of 12 or so. I tried about six different entries, and ordered an unconventional item myself, specifically the jerk chicken with collared greens and rice and beans. Surprisingly, the food was all very enjoyable. Brisket, tongue, jerk chicken, mac and cheese, pancakes, among others...everything was good. So I figured that the food was good, the dessert would be great, slam dunk. Strange thing...the cheesecake wasn't great. Don't get me wrong, it was fine. Just nothing special. Ultimately, I've had a lot of NY cheesecakes in NY; this one was no better than many of the others. It was almost too think, wasn't that sweet, fine but nothing great. I actually enjoyed the low sugar one more than the regular. It was also disappointing that the waitress told us that they'd charge us $5.25 to add fresh strawberries to one of the cheesecakes. Still, food was good, dessert was good, service was excellent. A very good experience.

I heard so many good things that I was really looking forward to eating at Juniors. My mom, boyfriend and I went today for Lunch. We ordered the bacon cheeseburger, western omelette and French toast with bacon. Before we received the food our waitress didn't offer us any of the complimentary dishes and I was wondering why since everyone else had it on the table. ( Beets, coleslaw, pickles and bread) we had to ask for them which I didn't like and instead of bringing us bread and cornbread she only bought us 3 slices of cornbread. But again I'm not too sure how that works, if you get it with a specific dish and what not.. The food was Ehhhhhh! The cheeseburger had no flavor and it was super dry. The omelette on the other hand it was really good but my mom got food poisoning and I'm not really sure why... the French toast was ok but too greasy because of the way it was deep fried ... tables were super sticky and the service was okay. Also, there's this other girl that works there in all black, not sure if she's the bus girl or not.. ( Alittle chubby ) she kept slamming the box with the utensils and had such a bad attitude in her face when a customer looked at her....overall, experience was ok....
