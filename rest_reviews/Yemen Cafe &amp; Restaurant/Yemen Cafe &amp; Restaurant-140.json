You know this place is legit because the clientele seem to be mostly Yemenis and people from other Arab countries. Yemeni food is unlike any food you've had - it most reminds me of some combination of Middle Eastern, Ethiopian, and Indian. \n\nAll their dishes come with a tasty soup, a salad, and unlimited homemade bread. They are most famous for their haneeth, which is a delish slow roasted lamb with rice. However, my go-to dish is the glaba which is minced lamb saut\u00e9ed with onions and tomatoes and flavored with a combination of spices that are out of this world. The loubia stew will knock your socks off.\n\nFor drinks, they do offer Hawaiian Punch but this is a Yemeni restaurant so you should get the Special Yemen Tea. It is located in a self-serve thermos in the back. I was a fool and poured the tea into one of the metal cups. Those are for water. Use the styrofoam cups for the tea and your experience will be much more pleasant.\n\nThere is a secret dessert hiding out in the appetizer section called Fatah with Honey. Get this. It is a divine combo of soft sliced Yemeni bread, honey, and black seeds. Make sure you get it with cream.", "author": "Nick T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-17", "description": "This place is definitely one of the stops for food if you are in the area. True Yemeni food. Clean and generous. I am a heavy meat person and I got to say wow. The cleanest lamb meat in town! Hummus is also one of the finest around.

If i could post the video, it would do justice to the presentation and the magnificent creation. The fresh clay oven bread accompanying all the meals \n\nEveryone def. needs to check the place out and I surely look fwd to returning very very soon...!", "author": "Asim F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-19", "description": "My favorite spot in downtown Brooklyn.

There was 14-16 of us, so we had a family style for appetizers and salad and we ordered our own entrees.\n\nWe were each given a bowl of lamb soup which I thought was sauce for the pita bread at first, but I suppose you can drink it as a soup or use it as a dip too. Any way, it had the right amount of seasoning with just a hint of spice and tasted similarly to curry. The pita bread that was given to us is similar to Roti Canai. It had a bit of a crunch to it and tastes really well when dipped in the lamb soup. The waiters also gave us a plate of hummus and Baba ghanoush which I absolutely loved because there's eggplant in it. It complements well with the pita bread.\n\nThe Lamb Haneeth is one of the most popular dishes at Yemen Cafe and many of my classmates ordered it as did I. The lamb is slow roasted and served with mixed vegetables and basmati rice. I was really excited in trying this dish since it's one of the popular dishes and I love lamb! Everything was on point and seasoned just perfectly! The lamb was so moist and the meat had a nice shade of pinkness to it, really light, moist, and the best part was it fell right off the bone. This dish was really super filling!\n\nThis was a nice experience. It was different, but I liked it. I think I would give Middle Eastern food.Now that I have tried Middle Eastern food, it makes me wonder how Australian or even Portuguese food would taste like.", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-26", "description": "OK kebabs and lamb chops but the clueless service detracts from the experience.

I came alone and it was a great surprise. I had never tried Yemeni food before and loved it. \n\nIt is a pretty busy atmosphere full of a large I believe to be Yemeni people, although I could be wrong. I don't want to stereotype. Regardless it seems to have very authentic food based on the staff and crowd. \n\nEverything I tried, which was largely whatever the waiter recommended to me was amazing, really flavorful and delicious. \n\nThe second time I came I was super excited to bring a skeptical friend and man was I disappointed. The place was super busy this time borderline raucous , there were kids literally walking on tables, which made us hope that they clean them all very well after each customer leaves. \n\nWhile that would have been enough to reduce my original five star impression it was really the food that was disappointing as well that dropped my review all the way down to two. \n\nThis time I tried to  order myself and ordered to lamb dishes which were described elaborately and seemed amazing. The first one was decent, very tender although not as flavorful as I had expected or desired. The other was the kababs which really were only one star quality. \n\nThey were extremely tough way over cooked more than a little charred on the outside and completely flavor less. We didn't even finish them they were so bad. \n\nUltimately, I was super embarrassed I brought someone here and also completely disappointed by experience.", "author": "Carlos P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-16", "description": "Food is below average \nWe had the fahsah and lamb haneeth which apparently were their best dishes and we were not impressed \nWe also had the kibdah \"lamb liver\" which was great \nService was great as well", "author": "Osamah A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-15", "description": "Don't know where to start.

The place was packed when we got there so we had to wait for a table.  Once we were seated in the tight, dingy looking dining room, the food right away started coming out.  The meal started promising, a wonderful lamb soup and a nice salad.  Then, as quickly as our orders were taken, our entrees came out.  Chicken haneeth was over cooked, dry and not seasoned at all.  Even worse, chicken agda had absolutely no flavor what so ever.  Could've benefitted from being served with a more fragrant basmati rice instead of the plain white rice they served with it.  Service was quick and friendly.  Prices are fair for the large portions you're given.  I just wish the food wasn't so bland.  I do not recommend this place at all.", "author": "Anthony G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-24", "description": "Great food and service.

We all ordered Haneeth (a fall outta bone beef or chicken with rice).

It's worth it to try.\n\nThe meal starts with a lamb broth soup that is automatically brought out. It was delicious and one of the best parts of the meal.\n\nWe had the Foul to begin, which is a mixture of fava beans, tomatoes, and onions that is cooked in a stone bowl and comes out bubbling. You eat it with the flatbread that the servers bring out. It was good, but not amazing. \n\nWe then had the Lamb Haneeth with basmati rice.
