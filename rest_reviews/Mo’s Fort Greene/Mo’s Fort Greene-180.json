We had the coffee, chicken and waffles, organic eggs breakfast with a side of cheese grits and apple sausage. All of the food was good and our waitress was sweet. The chicken and waffles came with 3 pieces of chicken which was generous! My only complaint was that the cheese grits and the chicken were a little too salty. Once you took the skin off the chicken it was fine but we really couldn't get into the grits like we wanted too.

The menu advertises their chips as \"homemade,\" yet they were the most store-bought chips I've ever tasted in my life. The cheese was hard and tasted like they pumped it out of a gas station in New Jersey and drove it all the way to the bar in a refrigerator before serving it to me.", "author": "Adam B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-19", "description": "Way less diverse than it use to be.  I had high hopes for making the pilgrimage back to the \"new Mo's\" but in all honesty this shit is super basic.  Too many wannabe thugs, \"old school playas\" and people who looked like they were hanging out with their \"black friends\" that night.  Things use to mesh effortlessly in this place but now it just seems like it's trying too hard.  I was here on a Saturday night and its totally feasible that other days/times may be better.  I'd consider it for after work/happy hour but definitely not a late night spot.", "author": "Ivory W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-26", "description": "Spacious and good bartenders. This place is a blast. I've avoided going here when it gets cranking late at night: I prefer the mellow neighborhood bar vibe. And, this place offers a great vibe. I sat in on an impromptu Trivial Pursuit match that the bartender started \"just because.\" Winner got a shot on the house. Good deals on beer and a great selection.

The bartender seemed very easily distracted and needed more training.

I was kicked out because I accidentally knocked over someone's drink.\n\nThis is not a place to hook up.

The Parole Punch was tasty.  I'm not sure it is cash only in 2013 but...whatever.  The food was decent, nothing to write home about but, it is a bar.

It can get crowded! Tried to eat here one week night evening, but sat waiting outside for waitress for ~15 min after I waited a while at bar to be told to wait at table outside. Too hungry to wait.

Fun times both times though I think I like this version a bit better. Fun, nice place. The food is meh but the drinks are stiff enough and it's great that you can get table service.

Not cute.", "author": "niesha d."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-22", "description": "As a 10+ year Brooklynite who frequented the old Moe's, I was very skeptical of the \"transition\".  After all, I thought the new owners could have at least come up with a new name!  While I made no plans to go back, I decided to give it a try last Sunday night b/c Soul Summit was having a party there.  The venue had overlapped their booking, so when I showed up the comedy show was still going on, although no one seemed to be laughing... Everyone was standing around waiting to boogie.  Eventually the music started about an hour late and the place was fairly packed.\n\nMy main criticism is that the new owners barely gave the place a facelift.  The cushions in the back are were the same old, smashed cushions.  There were some small new booths across from the bar, but I have got to give the new owners a D+ for effort in decorating a \"new\" bar.  They put in little to no effort in the remodel aside from gluing album covers to the wall.  Putting in a couple flat screens is not a remodel...\n\nThe bartenders were responsive and the drinks were decent, but the apathetic and lackluster remodel leaves me disappointed.", "author": "Tadd W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-21", "description": "Mo's is a good spot! Great music! Great staff! It gets crowded!  No cover!! Casual dressy.. Anything you can wear with a wedge or heel! I wouldn't wear flip flops but if that's what your comfy in.. Go for it!

This is only in reference to the brunch. I bought a brunch groupon a few months ago because I live nearby, but upon reading the reviews about this being a great place to pick up women or get drunk not far from home, I was apprehensive to say the least. Generally pub/bars/clubs don't do next-day brunch well and I was worried the place would be dirty from the night before and the food would be sub-par frozen bagels with philadelphia cream cheese. Not the case at all! \n\nThe food was amazing, especially for a place that's known for being a bar. One of the best brunches I've had in a while. The bagel and lox plate was everything it needed to be; the fried chicken(respectable) and waffles(banging!) plate was on point; I even loved the cheese grits and I don't really like grits in general! The place had a good atmosphere and was clean enough. We sat by the window on a rainy, lazy Sunday afternoon. It was just nice and laid-back. The one drawback: the service; the waitress was a little spacey, would just disappear for a long time and kept trying to memorize our order, but it seemed like a challenge, though she did get about 95% of it right. I wasn't that bothered by it, I was just enjoying the food and my company! \n\nI like Mo's so much, I just got another groupon. Oh, another thing, I don't know about this place at full price, but I felt like it was a really great deal for the quality, taste and portions of the food!", "author": "Carla M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-03-10", "description": "The Indian girl that works at Mo's it RUDE RUDE RUDE ! I have never had a pleasant experience at Mo's when she is working there. She intentionally poured beer on my shoes. She turned the beer bottle upside down over my shoes and the remaining beer in the bottle got on my clothes and shoes. She then had a weird snicker on her face after she did it.

Ever since then, I've gone back to Mo's 5 other time and they never disappoint....  They have the best chicken and waffle ... Portion was nice and service was great....  Also love their french toast and chicken sausages....  \n\nI can't comment on dinner - I've only tried their brunch..... \n\nWill certainly go back.", "author": "Honest R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-21", "description": "Went in for brunch.\n\nCoffee was warm but not hot. Took over 5 minutes to get a new cup that was reheated in the microwave and served in a cup with a crack in it.\n\nOrdered Breakfast potatoes which were extra since none of the brunch items seem to come with a side. The potatoes never arrived even after being told by our waitress they would be right out. Server was very apologetic but I'd rather have been told up front they weren't available so I could have ordered something else. \n\nGrits were greasy.\n\nThis was the first and last time I would eat here. Food was good but not great and brunch items should come with a side. The server was nice and as I said very apologetic but with a more experienced server all these issues could have been avoided.\n\nMaybe I'm showing my age here but the hostess was texting while standing at the front door.

People go to lounges and clubs to dance of course and a dance floor would be relatively packed but I guess this bouncer felt like he was the King of Ft. Greene this night, I arrived with my friend from Canada for the holiday weekend. We were able to get into the place no problems (and no cover which is a great plus for this location), able to get to the bar with no real long wait and not over crowded. We had about 2 rounds and proceeded to the dance floor where we were stopped and told we could not go up. I looked at the crowd and was like \"ok I understand we will just wait a moment\". Then about 5 min later a group came in and went to the bar (I know because they were right next to me ordering) then proceeded to the dance floor without being stopped. Me and my friend (a female I might add) approached the dance floor again and again we were stopped with the security saying \" I control this and I am not letting anyone up there\". I looked at him with such disdain but said to myself \"it is a beautiful weekend and there are plenty other spots to go\". I am only writing this review in hopes the staff at Mo's tighten up. I know it is a populated city but this place is for locals and regulars so there is no need for staff to act posh and uppity especially if your only a door man.", "author": "Lawrence S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-09", "description": "Crazy owners just let one of the best DJs in Brooklyn walk because they didn't want to pay him more money, even though he was the reason so many people showed up.
