I cannot wait to go back in that line and wait some more for that delicious pizza. My bestie L and I went here and ate a whole large pizza by ourselves. I did the heavy lifting but MAN did this pizza hit the spot. It was worth the wait. It was worth the flight from Indianapolis to NYC. They do pizza right alright. All the toppings tasted good. Mushrooms really go well with pizza!!\n\nBathrooms are fine, service is fine, you do share tables with others but hey who cares when you're having food-gasms with your pizza. Love love love!! P.S. I think it's cash only.... Be prepared to wait. It will be good! :) And I will definitely be back one day.", "author": "Jessica O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-07", "description": "BEST PIZZA WE'VE EVER HAD! My boyfriend and I decided to travel to NYC from Boston. We ordered a large pepperoni, chicken and extra cheese pizza. Definitely filling! The crust was excellent--there was a certain flavor to it and the crunch was perfect! The only downside is the wait--we waited about 30-40 mins outside, and once we were seated, we waited another 20-something mins. Be prepared to wait in line for some time, and then at the table! The wait is definitely worth it, though!", "author": "Jailene E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-21", "description": "BEWARE!

It's everything you were told and more.  \n\nSome tips: \n\n-Get there at least 45 minutes prior to opening time because the line can stretch down five blocks -- no joke.  \n\n-A small pizza ($12 base; +$2/topping; large is $14 base) can be split among two people with large appetites or four girls on a diet.  I would be in the former group.  \n\n-All pizzas come with basil by default, but they hand-shred the basil, so you get a net of three leaves.  My advice: pay the additional $2 for extra basil.  \n\n-If you eat meat, opt for sausage.  It's pure awesomeness.  Less is more when it comes to Neapolitan pizza, so I would not order more than two toppings.    \n\n-Go to the Brooklyn location.  You will not immediately have room for dessert if you split a small pizza with one other person, but still enough energy left to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Once you've crossed it, you will then have room for a Chinatown bakery pastry.  It's the perfect plan.  \n\n-They don't sell by the slice, but why would you not want a whole pie?  Silly.\n\n-It's cash-only.", "author": "Cathy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-12", "description": "Pizza was good but really wasn't worth making the trek out for. \n\nToppings are extremely over priced considering the amounts they give you. \n\nIf you're in the area give it a try, if not, just look in your area.", "author": "Mendel L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-02", "description": "I know this is a New York establishment, and maybe at one point it was the best pizza, but I think that there are better pizza spots out there. We came at an off time (around 4 PM) for lunch, so we were able to get a table pretty quickly. However, it was sandwiched between two other tables, making really inconvenient every time we wanted to get in and out. I'm certainly not knocking them because their customers were rude (they weren't particularly accommodating when we tried to go to the restroom. One lady even commented brusquely \"it's a good thing you're small...\" and to be fair, she had a point because it might have been impossible for someone else to get in and out). However, I think that they probably should re-think their seating arrangements! I know that this is New York and space is at a premium, so restaurants try to make the most of their tiny space, but most of the time , the servers at least try to help you get in and out of your seat if you're sandwiched in. In our case, our server couldn't even reach us! I had to stand up to get water from them, and hand it to the friend with whom I was dining!? It was also a bit precarious when they reached over the other table to deliver our pizza!\nNow onto the pizza itself: 3 stars. And that's about it. The crust is good, but the tomatoes make the pie a bit soggy, particularly towards the end. I did think that the fresh mozzarella is really key to the pie. Without it, it would have been a pretty mediocre pizza. \nFYI: cash only.", "author": "Michelle W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-12", "description": "Definitely worth the walk across the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge.

Waited in a short line on a Thursday. Man controlling the line was rude. We were asked to go upstairs and when we arrived at the top we were ignored for about 3-5 minutes. It seemed like there were plenty of tables, why the wait? No air conditioning ,\nOnly fans that might help slightly depending where you are seated. No alcohol and no credit cards accepted. Servers are bored/rude. Very few options if you like veggie pies only mushroom, onion, and roasted peppers. I watched the waiters use the laminated menu to crumb clean the tables, gross! The Pizza was very good we got a large cheese and a large half sausage. The sauce tasted great the cheese was very fresh. The dough is thick and on the chewy side. Service = 1\nStar, pizza = 5 star Final score 2-1/2 stars . I am glad I checked it out would not go back. Beware they hide the tip on bill , so know what the total should be.

This is hands down one of the best pizza places in NYC! I'm a Pizza enthusiast! I have eaten pizza all over the world some good, some bad, and very few excellent! On a scale of 1-10, the pizza here is a 10+!!!! I have never had a bad experience here! I travel from Miami to NYC at least once/twice a month, this is my to go place every time I fly in!!! You do need cash as they don't take any other form of payment. I believe every business owner has the right to operate his/her business as they see fit. The cash thing really doesn't stop folks from coming in, I don't mind one bit paying cash for some dam good pizza!! I highly recommend it!!! I will caution you on the salty black olives, as they mention in the menu, they are salty as hell. I love olives, but not that salty. You won't regret the visit and prices are reasonable!!!

Very flavorful and the crust was just right, not too soggy and not stiff. Little can be said about the service of the wait staff. It took them a while to even acknowledge me sitting at the bar. There was at least 4 different waiters that passed or stood right in front of me and none of them said anything, gave no eye contact and made no effort to let me know that someone would be by to help me. They seemed more preoccupied with the tv that was showing epic fail videos. I had to flag down one of the bus boys cleaning up and he called my waiter which had passed by me at least twice since i got there. Overall, pizza is great, just dont expect good customer service.", "author": "Adrian T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-20", "description": "Yum, yum, yum!

The pizza is good, not phenomenal.  There's a long wait after you've ordered, which is a bummer. Going by the recent reviews, looks like it's been deteriorating over the years.  \n\nThe small and large pizzas differ by just $2, so you're better off buying one large pizza for 2 people instead of 2 small pizzas. \n\nService was bad and we wondered why, until we realized the tip was already included in the final bill.

Please don't waste your time in line at this place. I wouldn't say I'm a pizza snob- but I have had MUCH better pizaa in and around NYC. This pizza is about as average as Dominos; and given the choice- I'd pick Domino's over Grimaldi's! See, where I think we went wrong was not ordering enough toppings to mask the obscenely bland flavor of the pizza. We ordered two- one was the white pie (no sauce)- absolutely plain. Which sounds as plain as it was- crust and mozzarella, very ordinary mozzarella too. The next pie was a regular pie with jalapenos, very salty whole olives (who doesn't slice olives on a pizza) and onions (barely detectable). I was underwhelmed to say the least. I didn't even want the left overs. Definitely won't be coming back every again and will highly recommend people not standing in line in the winter to get a cramped table in this joint.

Grimaldi is much much better. Yelp you are letting the people down. About double the cheese, cheaper, and much more flavor.

I'm still not sure.. I think that after you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge from downtown on an empty stomach in the heat and then manage to find the place and wait in line out front in the heat for almost an hour... anything would be good served in Air-conditioning and serving you a cold drink to go with it. \n\nOnce you finally get in the joint, it's CASH ONLY!!! LOL.. Watching the people see this after their trek to see that they had no cash, was more than interesting.. they pack you in the place, sit you at a table with others.. so, if you sit 2 people at a table of 4, go to the restroom first, otherwise, you're trapped in the chair.. \n\nThe waiters are not very attentive and that is being kind- they barely wait on you or come by, imagine Tony Soprano's gang pissed off because they're slinging pizza in a dark dingy joint... hmm...or I think our waiter resembled the Italian kid friend from the show, \"The Wonder Years\".. I'd be more specific had he come back by to ask us how the food was or if we needed refills, another drink or something, but he didn't.  \n\nThe reason you wait so long outside is that the service bites.. they all get your order, never come back, then.. you sit there and have to wave someone down for your bill and remember.. It's CASH ONLY.. so, if you need change.. you'll sit there a long time to get that.. the table behind us sat there the entire time we got seated, ate and were trying to get our check to get their change.. yes, that is part of the dilemma with the wait outside.. Thankfully, I had cash and some singles to leave it after only waiting about 15 minutes to get anyone's attention to find the waiter for the ticket.. then, he never came back.. who thought he would? \n\nThere were 2 of us, we ordered the regular/small pizza and drinks.. it was only $24 or something.. the pizza was big, we didn't finish all of it.. others next to us with 2 people got the normal size and it was HUGE.. I guess if you want to take it with you, it's worth it, but who in the hell is going to carry a huge pizza box back across the bridge commuting where ever in the heat?? .. I will tell you who.. Tourists.. yes, I witnessed it.. and it was 98degrees outside and they were hauling it back over the Brooklyn Bridge with them.. Maneuvering through NYC is hard enough, let alone having to do it with a large pizza box.. to each their own.. My only reason for going through this experience was because my mom was visiting and had seen it on Food Network or something and had asked to go. \n\nThe Pizza- it's big, hot, piping hot, gooey, crispy thing crust and topped with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and we added garlic, mushrooms, pepperoni.. it was good. However, a few days later, we went to Patsy's Pizza in Midtown.. No wait, walked right in, A/C, good service and guess what? The pizza was just as good.. so, I wouldn't rush back over to do that again, when I can get the same/better closer.", "author": "Heather R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-10", "description": "I was disappointed at my experience this time around versus the first time around. And then I found out that this isn't the REAL Grimaldi's (they moved next door to Juliana's).\n\nThere was no line, and I was really shocked at how we were able to stroll into the restaurant to get a pizza.\n\nI definitely tried to keep an open mind when I ate the pizza, but it just wasn't as good.
