We spent at least $700 for a couple of shrimps, half a corn, two potatoes, and barely any meat. We're still hungry. It was tasty food and great service but they need quality and quantity.", "author": "Zawad N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-01-19", "description": "It was ok. I've had better. I tried the crab legs in garlic butter sauce with potatoes and corn on the cob. There was no option to mix or combine proteins. I could seriously have just had a pound of steamed crabs legs from the stop and shop up the street for half the price perhaps less.

Me and my husband both love seafood and had never even heard of this place before but I am so glad we found it because we will definitely be going back! A part from the delicious food the service was incredible! Our waiter whose name was Suwit (I asked him how to spell it) had such great energy and was so accommodating. Everything he recommended was simply delicious and the food and drinks came quickly, we were never waiting on anything! So not only are you going to have a bomb ass meal but incredible service as well. I cant say one bad thing about this place, just head on over!", "author": "Jamie R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-12-28", "description": "There is much to say about Claw Daddy's! First impressions.... great host and wait staff. We had zero wait with a reservation. At the bar, the adult capri sun is less than boozy. More like a regular capri sun. Nice flavor, but you do not feel like you're enjoying a cocktail!\n\nWe frequent The Boil every month and are HUGE fans, minus the wait. Here he ordered his usual...shrimp and snow crab. I ordered my usual... king crab in butter garlic with medium spice. Both of our meals were absolutely overwhelming. We could hardly taste the meal through the spice! I could not taste the garlic butter on my king crab whatsoever. The atmosphere was fun and I wish I could say I would be back, but I won't!", "author": "Alicia J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-26", "description": "This place did not disappoint me at all. The $7 happy hr drinks the $1 wings and oysters. We wanted everything on the menu because it all sounded so good. We had excellent service.

So me and my sister and my mom walked in to\nJust get a drink and we sat at the bar, their was two bartenders at the bar and one of them completely ignore us. We sat at the bar for 20 minutes and the bartender didn't greet us, ask u for our orders, ask if we wanted water or even remove the old food that was in front of us.

We ended up being sat within 20 minutes. Took a while for our server to get to us but that's because 4 of his tables were sat at the same time. My seafood bag came out significantly before the rest of the food, including the 5 wing appetizer but the food was good.  I wanted a regular cocktail, but they only serve those adult Capri Suns so I opted for a glass of Prosecco instead. The DJ's music selection was definitely a plus.
