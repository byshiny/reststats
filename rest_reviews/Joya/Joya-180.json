Unfortunately, the flavor is not my jam. The tom kha gai and tom yum soup were far too sweet.

Super affordable, great date night or just hanging with friends spot. The food is quick and their Red Curry Chicken and Vegetables Noodle dish is baller. It is also super affordable- Pad Thai and a lot of other entrees come in at $10 - $15, which is not typical for this neighborhood. Just as good as Song in Park Slope, which I believe has the same owners.", "author": "Kayla G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-22", "description": "I cannot agree with other reviewers more that this is the best Thai food in Brooklyn, hands down. They have great decor, a great outdoor seating area in the back, great service and when you factor in price, I don't know why you'd go anywhere else. I live in Brooklyn Heights and Joya doesn't deliver so I walk 15 min down there practically weekly to get my fix of Chicken Red Curry - go out of your way to go to this place!", "author": "John C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "Joya is a cool and hip little place with excellent Thai food! \u00a0The place has a friendly and relaxed atmosphere, Prices are very reasonable and service is nice and efficient.

The food was very fresh . Open kitchen so you can see the chefs cooking everything. Tried the fried calamari. The sauce made the dish tasty. The curry puffs was nicely seasoned . The spicy noodles had just the right amount of spice . Generous portions of food . Good value for the price .

She orders a meal with shrimp and veggies and rice.  She noticed that the shrimp was not deveined. Uhmmm yuck! She told them to take the food back and remove it off her bill.  They said they were willing to devein it right away.   My friend said no thanks, it should've been deveined already.

Nothing spectacular! We were seated immediately by the kitchen. It was fun to See the cooks make our dinner, but as I mentioned, it wasn't a memorable meal! We.

The temperature in the restaurant was 84 degrees didn't understand why management couldn't have adjusted the thermostat. Felt like I was eating in a sauna instead of a comfortable environment. Even the waiter was sweating felt bad for them. The main course was good but once again lacked flavor. Been here many times and am aware of how the dish should taste.

Some people left out of anger, lots of people were leaving during our never-ending wait, yet only one or two groups got seated.\n\nSomething clearly doesn't work here, it's probably the staff. Don't bother coming unless it's empty. There are too many other Thai places within 2-3 blocks distance, making going here a waste of time.\n\nAlso it's supposedly cash only, if you dare.", "author": "Ian J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-08", "description": "I think this might be my favorite Thai place, period. I've been here a couple times in the past, but that was several years ago. I'm glad to see that there hasn't been a decline in food, service or overall ambiance! \n\nTo start, we shared a small order of calamari. It was a perfect size for us. Though they looked a little light, they were flavorful and the sauce that went along with it was tasty. They were crispy and thankfully, there weren't too many tentacles. He had the massaman curry with jasmine rice and I had a beef pad see yu. This was the first place that I ever ordered this dish, and since then it has become my usual order. It was a large portion, especially for under $10! I definitely had to take some food home. The noodles didn't stick together, the beef was juicy and I didn't mind eating the veggies in it. I regret not ordering a Thai iced tea, but that just means I have a reason to come back. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came in a little before 6, and there was no wait. Score! We were seated in the outdoor area, which was cozy. Since there weren't too many people around, it felt romantic. \n\nService was good - we were checked up on several times (not that there were many people to look after). Our waters were full and our food came out pretty quickly. Our food was packed up quickly and they dropped off our check in a timely manner so we could get out of there.", "author": "Michelle B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-21", "description": "Modern and trendy local thai restaurant. Good prices, generous portions and friendly staff. However, their food is hit-and-miss. Overall, Joya offered a very satisfying experience. \n\nAdventitious lunch for 2 while we were in the neighborhood. Having reading many good things about Joya, we were not disappointed when we stepped in. The interior is beautifully modern; great place for intimate dinners and casual lunches. Lots of detail in their art hanging around the walls. Joya gives off a feel-good contemporary vibe. Their lunch specials are $10.00: anything on the menu + soup of the day/ house salad. We ordered the Massaman curry and Pad See Yue with a soup and a salad. \n\nMassaman Curry -- Probably one of the best Massaman curries I've ever tasted. The coconut and curry medley was perfect -- neither flavor was overpowering the other. The curry was creamy. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The amount of potatoes and chicken in the curry made it difficult to finish with just one bowl of rice. I ended up having to doggie bag the rest for another serving at home.\n\nPad See Yue -- Unimpressed. I have had way better pad see yue dishes in the past. My main qualm with the dish was the beef; the beef was way too overcooked. It was too tough and nearly flavorless. The noodles were also too cooked -- soft and almost soggy -- and too salty. A careless, messy contrast of a dish.\n\nAgain, wonderful atmosphere -- if I lived in the area, I would not mind coming here every week, if not to eat to just chill out. The food is my only qualm -- consistency is key and personally, I'd prefer not to play russian roulette with my food. With that said, Joya's still a winner in my books and I would not mind coming back.", "author": "Kenny M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-10", "description": "I eat in and order delivery on the regular from here.

Once she arrived, it was easy to get a table. The food was incredible and reasonably priced. Definitely recommend this place as a top notch Thai spot in Cobble Hill.
