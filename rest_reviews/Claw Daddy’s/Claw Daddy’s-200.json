There are two parts to this restaurant--a beautiful bar area and a casual sit down area. Plenty of space and really kind and great service. We stayed in the bar area and made it in time for some happy hour specials which were really amazing! $1 oysters, $1.50 baked oysters and clams, $5 beers, $6 wines. We stayed for dinner and had amazing chicken sliders, shrimp po boy, shrimp ceviche and deviled eggs. All were really great and the portions were very generous. I'm looking forward to coming back to try everything on the menu!", "author": "MR S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-03", "description": "Claw daddy's is one of my favorite seafood spots. I recommend it to anyone who would listen. Of course when I heard there was a new location downtown Brooklyn I had to visit. Upon arrival service was great, ambiance was good but I couldn't help but notice that the crab meat was a little saltier than usual. It wasn't the sauce but it was the actual meat itself. I'm not sure why but it was significantly noticeable and made my meal a little less enjoyable. I will consider trying by this location again but if this happens again I will have to continue to go to the city.", "author": "Asha G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-22", "description": "Amazing all the time.

Young feel.  Music was hip-hop which is aight but something a little softer would have been nice. Especially since the lighting is low.    Overall i really enjoyed. But just a little high on price for amount of food.  I am from New Orleans so i am biased.", "author": "D C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-08", "description": "I love Claw Daddy's. Their food is bomb. Their drinks are bomb. The ambience is great! 10/10 for sure.

It was the grand opening of the Brooklyn location and as expected they had no tables (we arrived at 7:40pm and were party of 6). we didn't quit that easily - we put our names on the waiting list, joined the bar and waited for a party to be called. Now what's cool about Claw Daddy's is they offer you these \"Capri Sun\" pouches for your beverages whether it's a nonalcoholic or one of their infamous cocktails you get to enjoy it in one of those cool adult kid like treats. After 20 to 30 minutes we were seated in the dining room. It was my first time at a restaurant as such, where you dine with bibs and gloves, but I opted to take the non-messy route for my first time at claw daddy's. Instead of opting for one of the seafood bowls I had a smorgasbord of appetizers - the chicken biscuit, the garlic butter shrimp, the lobster roll and the little fish puppies. My friends ordered the seafood bowls which I did sample and I must say they were pretty damn tasty (it's part of the reason why I'm going back!) There's no reason for all that flavor to be locked up in a plastic bag and I don't have a chance to fully enjoy it. Overall Claw Daddy's was a great experience: love the food and music. My waiter was so-so but the general manager gets four stars.", "author": "Laquana B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-31", "description": "I got played eating at this place. We ordered a 1.5 pound lobster with there garlic butter sauce. I was excited until I actually tried the food. The lobster came with two pieces of the tiniest corn and two tiny potatoes (great sides). Inside the lobster there was barley any meat. The quality of the lobster was beyond horrible. When it comes to seafood of your eating bad quality you have a huge chance of getting food positioning. I'm staying away from this place and if I do decide to eat lobster it'll be in red hook.", "author": "Julius S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-28", "description": "To be honest they need to learn how to season their crab legs. $56 for mad unseasoned crab legs is not fair. drinks are the best only good thing about this place sorry.

Touching the lemons or mints. Make a drink didn't like it then throw it out never to wash out the cup.\nTwo two bartenders what working Sunday evening neither one showed any interest I approached the manager and ask him if these are the only girls working he went to the other bartender and I watched her say to the manager what about the other girl  when I finally spoke to the rude girl to ask the service she asked me you're not waiting for a table no I'm waiting to get a drink I don't understand why that makes it different why did it took her that long and if she thought we was waiting for a table there was still food in front of us you didn't clean up your bar area..

Brooklyn's Claw Daddy's ROCKS!", "author": "Aisha T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-24", "description": "Claw Daddy's is my favourite restaurant in NYC and I often visit the LES location. This was my first time at the Brooklyn location and I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere was more intimate and the music was upbeat. The food is not as good as the LES location but its still up there (pro tip, order a side of mac n cheese and mix in a little of the Claw Daddy's special sauce). The Happy Hour special is one of the best around with $1 oysters, $1.50 grilled oysters and $5 draught beer. The LES location is better for larger groups but the BK Claw Daddy's is well suited to dates. One thing I would add is the food came a little quickly, there was too much on the table in one go. I would ask the waiter to slow the food down as to not overwhelm the table.", "author": "Matthew B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-20", "description": "This place was great.
