Before going to Grimaldi's you have to understand that it is an experience... waiting in line, being crammed next to people you don't know, and  your waiter being short with you. It's all part of the Grimaldi's experience. I think the best part of our dinner there was that they made a cheeseless pizza for Hannah, and in my opinion is was better than the pizza we got with cheese.", "author": "Hannah R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-15", "description": "Don't miss the BEST pizza in all of metro New York.

On a cold January night, my friend and I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and waited in 41 degrees chills for 1.5 hours, only to get disrespected by the old white-haired owner. The wait outside is long and he was pushing people to step behind a crack in the step. He got a little rough and I don't think it was necessary for him to use his hands to push people, he could've just asked us to, since the line wasn't rowdy (we were too cold). \n\nIf there's one thing that irks me, it's when random strangers touch and shove me. I got annoyed and said he shouldnt be pushing people. Then he yelled at us loudly and rudely in a menacing way that we need to step back, and to not worry about who was behind us, but just to keep ourselves in check. WTF. I really regret not saying anything to him then, or getting out of line, but by then, it was already 50 minutes the wait and I was too stunned that a restaurant owner would treat their customers like that.\n\nSo the owner is an a-hole who ruined the experience and taste for me. I know I can't stop people from going here, the hour+ long wait says something about the food, but for me, Grimaldi's has let its popularity get to its head and the shitty service doesn't warrant a pizza.", "author": "janice l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-05", "description": "girmaldi's, the pizza that made the brooklyn bridge famous--hey, i just found out that they have 2 in texas!\n\nbut sure its worth the wait in the sea of tourist (just be sure to wear you fanny pack floaties cause you can drown if not careful!). the pizza is paper thin and with burnt edges.\n\nRemember if theres a line of people, make sure to follow and conform to the crowd!", "author": "Ishmael V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-12-31", "description": "they dont even deserve this star. when my grilfriend told about thisplase i thought it would be awesome, but i got disappointed.\n \nfirst this place s aweful.\n\nsecond croweded and not enought place\n\nThird they charge for the service, the getting tips why they charge for the sevice.\n\n4th the people who are serving are in a rush and they want the costumers to leave early forn that place.\n\n5th they use cheap toppings such as pepperoni, sausage, mozzarella, and other toppings. they charge a lot of money for cheap toppings this is stupid\n\n6th the owner or whoever that guy is, is rude and look like that he doesn not like the people. at least he should nice whit the people because we are giving him our money to make him rich. \n\nthey dont delivery, they dont have parking, the sevice is slow, the people who eat pretend tehy enjoy the food. but the true is that they hate taht pizza. when i was there a saw one couple who pretented to enjoy the pizza, the guy was acting likeif he enjoys the pizza. \n and one more thing sorry if my grammar is bad, but this is how they sould descrived.", "author": "Juan Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-20", "description": "Best pizza in NYC hands down!

Even betta, it's in Brooklyn! Fugheddaboudit! What a bunch of assholes here. Even worse than those Italian guys wearing an F.B.I. shirt or getting a Ford Mustang just to have that Italian badge on, but not as bad as those Gotti boys with a fake tan and a hairdo that look's like Enola Gay dropped another H-bomb. I'm talking about the cameriere at the damn joint. Why must it talk 2 hours to make pizza after waiting in line for an hour? Why do places like this must have an attitude? So a joint like this gets customers, they have to treat customers like shit? What a bunch of stronzo's working here, right? Fuckin' deal with it, cuz this is New York. It's a place where assholes from all over the world come to live. We're the international hub for assholes everywhere. We hate everybody here, but if one of us goes down, we stick like glue and then we hate each other all over again. Grimaldi's known for it's brick oven and it takes time to get the wood burning. This is an ideal place to order in advance for take-out and dine in if you're willing to drink with friends and family for a long time, cuz they will not give two shits about you, ya know whattamean, oh!\n\nOverall, you finook, go here if you're waiting for the water taxi to take your ass to Ikea, but if you want something else, go to Lombardi's.

Despite the line of tourists eager for the experience outside it just isn't that good. If you want to try the pie - really - call ahead - don't wait in the long ass line.
