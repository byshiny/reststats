I've been to the Fatty Daddy in Park Slope but have been waiting forever for a great taco joint to open closer to me. Very similar idea, and they nail it. I've already had the steak tacos and the spicy stewed chicken burrito -- both top-notch -- and my kids have devoured the al pastor tacos and chicken quesadilla. And they are tough customers, let me tell you...\n\nWe've taken out, and eaten there -- both times food came quickly and service was great. These are folks who love what they do and it shows.

Probably would have given 3.5-4 stars based on my initial meal, but my left overs grossed me out. I ordered two chicken quesadillas, a side of chips and a side of spicy salsa. When it first was delivered, it was a pretty large portion and the chips and salsa were great. The salsa was pretty spicy so if you don't like spicy, you should get regular heat. The quesadillas tasted good, nothing amazing, but good solid quesadilla. When I went to eat my leftovers the next day, I bit into a HUGE piece of bone. The bone was probably the length of my pinky finger. It grossed me out and I couldn't finish the rest of my leftovers after that. I don't want to have to worry about having bones in my chicken so I'm not sure if I would order from here again :-( Maybe I will stay away from anything that may potentially have bones in it because the prices were reasonable and the portions were big.", "author": "Isabella S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-09", "description": "It is a good taco. Is it amazing? No it is not. Will you get a smile? Definitely. They make good tacos here. And for Brooklyn they are good. For California, they would be ok. I actually liked here the grilled fish tacos. First time I prefer it over the steak or the chicken. Flour tortilla is a must, and a touch of spice and lemon.

First of all, my food took 30 minutes to come out, and when it finally did, I had to send it back because they got my order wrong. 45 minutes later, my food is not out. I wait 13 more minutes, and my food comes out. The tortilla tasted so bland and stale that I might have guessed it was cardboard if I had a blindfold on.

I understand Fatty Daddy is owned by Layla Jones, a great place and neighborhood institution that I have loved for 10 years, which makes it all the more sad to say how much I disliked this.   \n\nIt's not so much that the food quality horrible, its that it obvious the owners are devoid of ANY effort in making an attempt to understand what Mexican food is about before they opportunistically took this location (which once was a decent bar).   I get the feeling that they thought \"hey, people like Mexican food...It seems easy and we can make some money.\" \n\nI've been a few times, just to see if I'd see some signs of effort, but each time the food was painfully thoughtless.  My first meal there kinda summed it up.  My burrito consisted of some super bland, cold-ish Chorizo, plain BASMATI rice (huh?), some chopped tomato, some chopped romaine lettuce, and the most sorry black beans ever that had absolutely no flavor and tasted as if they were sprinkled in right from the Goya tin.  Surrounding this lifeless innards was a massive tortilla that was not even given a touch of heat...again, tasted right from the package. \n\nIs it really that hard to learn how rice is prepared in a Mexican food tradition, is taking the time to cook and flavor beans?  (only black beans on offer, FYI, not pinot beans as would seem a logical addition)\n\nNo, I didn't get poisoned, and its not the end of the world, but its a very sad state of affairs when such effortless food is being offered.  \n\nMaybe people don't care and are happy to spend money for this, but Mexican food is an amazing, glorious, and flavorful thing  -  I'd love it for Fatty Daddy to bother to learn what it's actually all about.  It's not too late!
