You can see the bagels cooking in the back, baked daily. The bread is always soft and delicious on the inside. The bagels are served with more than a healthy serving of the cream cheese, which looks to be homemade. The veggie kind has big chunks of pepper, carrot, and onion in it.

The service was great but it all changed from there . \n\nSo we get our food and sit outside the movie theater , my husbands bagel didn't have bacon like we ordered it only had egg n ketchup , so they messed up the order . Then my bagel was just weird , it had a really strange taste to it . It tasted kind of moldy and metallic just like someone els has wrote on here . It was weird cause I couldn't pin point it but really felt like throwing up . Needless to say it was a waist of money . The bagels suck at this place .

I bought bagels for my son and his roommates thinking they'd be thrilled to have free food. They were not. My son said, \"Dad, that's the place where I just spit the bagel out and threw it away. We'll go eat breakfast somewhere else.\"\n\nI thought he must be exaggerating,. He was not. I took one of the bagels to munch on my way back to our hotel. The bagels had a very unpleasant taste to them which I could not readily identify. Metallic? Sorta, but not quite. Moldy? Yes, but not exactly. I then read somebody else's review and they said \"metallic and moldy\" to which I responded, \"There you go, it's both metallic and moldy.\" I belched that gross metallic, moldy flavor the rest of the day. Yuck.\n\nEither there's something in the water affecting Brooklynites powers of discrimination or it must be hit-or-miss on the bagels. How else to explain the discrepancy between reviews gushing \"best bagels on the face of the planet\" and those lamenting \"gross metallic moldy taste; I threw it in the trash?\"\n\nSo, roll the dice. You'll either have a great experience, as some people seem to, or you'll be burping up moldy bagel for hours. As for me, I'll never go back here.\n---\nAugust 2016 Update\nWe had friends visiting from North Carolina. They stayed in our apartment in BH for a week. i said \"You can get great bagels anywhere in New York, but avoid La Bagel Delight, they're gross.\" \n\nSo friends are enjoying New York, posting pictures on FB, when one of their NC friends commented \"How are the bagels? Aren't NYC bagels are the best?\" The response came back \"Meh.\"\n\n\"What do you mean NYC bagels are 'meh?'\" I asked. Turns out they went to La Bagel Delight. Didn't I tell you this was the one place to avoid? We had to take them to a proper bagel place (cough...Montague...cough...Street) so they didn't leave thinking NYC was the land of \"meh\" bagels.", "author": "Tim R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-16", "description": "I love coming here for bagels!

YES, they have MINI-BAGELS if you are susceptible to carb-guilt like I am. LOVE IT!\n\nSPREADS: The olive pimiento is my favorite - very flavorful! But beware, they will place an entire tub of spread on your bagel.

Now I give some places the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was my hair but really.. unless I was in the back of the kitchen and put a strand of my hair to get cooked inside the egg, that's not even a possibility. It was just so mortifying when I found a strand of hair literally lodged inside the egg, please let me make that clear, it did not just fall into my sandwich, it was clearly cooked inside the egg. I love my breakfast, and the fact that this place absolutely ruined my day because of it was a huge let down.\n\nI didn't want to be rash, so I called the place and asked if I could talk to management about what I found in my sandwich. The lady who picked up told me to call back at 2:00PM because they were going through a lunch rush. I didn't know that 11:00 A.M. was a lunch rush. I decided at that point it isn't worth it and that the least I could do for this joint ruining my day and ignoring my request to talk to management is to make sure that the people of Yelp have a clear indication as to why exactly no one in the downtown Metrotech area of Brooklyn should EVER have the unfortunate experience I went through.\n\nSo check this out.. this place has had previous violations for personal hygiene among vermin, and food safety violations.

While I wasn't necessarily looking for a chain-y kinda place, La Bagel was literally around the corner from the NYC Transit Museum (our killing time destination) and it had four stars.\n\nI was so pleased! It was around 11 am on a Sunday, there was no wait, and we got our food reasonably fast. \n\nA couple things though: \n1. The counter girls were constantly just yelling \"Next! Next on line!\" in a really not nice get-your-ass-over-here-or-get-the-f-out kind of way. There wasn't even anyone to get INTO line! I don't know if that's just the Brooklyn in them, or if that's just the La Bagel way, or if they're just robotically calling for the next customer as a habit (because I'm sure it gets busy enough in there that the yelling is at times necessary). Who knows, but honestly, minus a star because it was just abrasive.\n\n2. They gave me the wrong cream cheese on my bagel. However! The counter girl was extremely sweet, apologized and got my corrected order out pronto. She even offered to me to keep the wrong one, too, but I really didn't need it. So they redeemed themselves for a portion of the abrasiveness here. Very pleased with the service.\n\nThe bagel and coffee BLEW MY MIND. I don't know why it was so damn good! I WAS hungry, I AM pregnant, but seriously, it was just delightful. Maybe that's where the name comes from? I would go back a hundred times over.
