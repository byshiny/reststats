Shake Shack has somehow found the balance between fast food but still retaining quality. The 4 locations I've tried, including Fulton Ferry, Citi Field, Uptown East, and Midtown, they all retain a high quality while ripping through lines and lines of people waiting for burgers.\n\nThe burgers are also juicy and large, and it feels and tastes like homemade burgers, not a pre-packaged frozen assembly line that fast food operations run.\n\nBravo Shake Shack, Bravo.", "author": "Rod V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-03", "description": "Note: we only split a chocolate/pb milkshake, but it was amazing!

They're so freaking addicting. \n\nMy sis couldn't find parking at smorgasburg so she said shake shack it was cuz luckily there was parking like 20 minutes away from shake shack LOL thank god right because 20 minutes walking in 98 degrees is a super fantastic idea for a heat stroke. I mean for a burger. Yeh she had that mean shake shack burger crave. Me, on the other hand, I'm a shake shack fries kinda glutton. As we ate our perspective orders (her=burger, me=fries), a worker doing his rounds to assure their service gets to our table. He said you look like a regular and I was like yah yah of course. Then, he asked how are we doing. I said awesome! And he was like awesome?! :o :D I said your fries are awesome~~~! And he laughs and says something I can't remember because I go back to eating le fries. Very shortly, he comes back and slips a card for a complimentary order of fries under my elbow  woah haha it was an awesome experience :D thank you Shake Shack!", "author": "Teresa C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-14", "description": "First time at a shake shack where there is no line to order.

Though the textures were great (chicken with a crisp outside and tender and moist inside, soft bun) there really wasn't much flavor going on. They say that there is \"buttermilk herb mayo\" on it, but it definitely didn't give enough to make the sandwich work. The same goes for the pickles. I didn't even notice their contribution to the sandwich. No kick. Just flat. And a chicken sandwich should come dressed for success. I shouldn't end up trying to rub the side in my hot dog toppings to try to give it flavor.\n\nDid it fill me up to some degree? Yes. But would I order it again or recommend it to others? No. \n\nI think they need to make it a lot more flavorful (flavors should pop!) and interesting before rolling it out in Shake Shacks all over. Right now, Chick-fil-a definitely has them beat across the board. I'm thinking I should give Fuku and some other local places a shot, though...", "author": "Lauren B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-27", "description": "I just wanna say thank you to this particular Shake Shack (or Shake Shake from all the times I've been calling it tbh) for allowing my friends and me to hang out during our Brooklyn day of our New York trip. There was a lot of fun memories at this Shake Shack when we were at Brooklyn (since this was the closest one to the bridge haha). At one point we had a huge gap during our day and we didn't know what to do for about 3-4 hours, so we ended up just hanging out here at this Shake Shack...like 3-4 times haha. Like I said in my other review for Shake Shack, I think the food is overpriced and coming from LA/California, I still prefer In-N-Out in my opinion but I do enjoy the good and chill vibes at Shake Shack during my time in New York City.

The one in Dumbo sells draft beers (not bottle beers) which not every location offers. I always get Shroom Burger because if I get the one with the patty, it becomes too heavy for me to digest. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it's so hard to find a place to sit down and the tables and floor get messy and dirty during busy time. The bathroom which has a number lock also gets dirty frequently. Oh well, I'm just going to concentrate on enjoying my delicious cheese-filled fried portobello mushroom burger whenever I come here!", "author": "Irene M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-09", "description": "Tried the new ChickenShack at the DUMBO location last night. Nicely-seasoned batter, very moist inside -- definitely one of the better fried chicken sandwiches in New York. \n\nWhile it may not quite match Chick-Fil-A on its best of days, the ChickenShack is still very delicious -- without the flavor of bigotry.", "author": "Mike T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-06", "description": "I've been waiting forever to finally try a Shake Shack burger. Living on the west coast, you only hear about the utter madness SS has inspired in New Yorkers. Now that I've finally had one, well ... it was a good burger. That much I can agree with. Fresh ingredients, not overly greasy -- definitely a good burger. Love the house draft root beer too. That's a nice touch -- don't always want just Coke or Pepsi. Not thrilled with the fries too. Crinkle cut? I'm like, \"Am I at Del Taco?\"\n\nBut is the hype justified? Gotta go with a firm no on this one. I've had plenty of gourmet-ish burgers at both full-service and upgraded fast-food places. SS definitely stacks up, that's for sure. But does it compare to the west coast king, In-N-Out Burger? Well, sort of. But really, these are two different style of burgers. I like both, but there's no comparison between the two.\n\nWhat I wasn't feeling was how much SS costs. $45 to feed four? At a burger place? Not really crazy about that. All in all though, definitely a good burger. Just make sure you get there early and beat the lines.", "author": "Cee A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-04", "description": "Not to be confused with the Downtown Brooklyn/Fulton Mall location, this Dumbo one is utter chaos. It's a shame because it's such a prime location with a lot of potential, but suffers from being WAY too small, making even the C-line wait horrendous because there are people everywhere (even the restroom bathroom hindered people trying to get to their tables). Maybe I'm just spoiled by the service and gratitude at other locations when I load up on Shake Sale vouchers, but they just seemed harried and actually even stamped incorrectly here.\n\nPS 'Fulton Ferry District' is not a city yet somehow the magic Yelporithm knows it's in Dumbo?
