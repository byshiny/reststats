I'd never heard of this restaurant before but so happy they've opened a location in DUMBO. The food is flavorful and fresh. I've tried various sides and proteins and all have been a party in my mouth. On top of it all, they are reasonably priced (comparable to Dig Inn and Sweet Green). One of my new favorite \"bowl\" restaurants!", "author": "Dorothy J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-10", "description": "I live in the area and alternate this place with untamed sandwiches across the street.
