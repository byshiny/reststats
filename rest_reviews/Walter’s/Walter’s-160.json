To keep from popping off I just left.

This is one of the very few places we are regulars at. When we need our shredded duck bun and artichoke dip fixes, nothing else will do. Big up to walters for keeping what comes out of the kitchen consistent for the 3 years and change ive been going there. They also have an amazing burger that is not to be missed. Love this spot! Service is always on point too.

I saw the restaurant in passing, and it was fairly busy for a Tuesday evening, so the following week, I made it a point to give it a try, particularly with the great Yelp reviews.\n\nWe arrived at 7:15 and already the place was nearly full. But there were still a few tables open, so we were seated right away. I decided to cheat on my diet and order the fried chicken, and switched the fries for the mashed potatoes. JUST HEAVEN. My husband got the grilled bar steak, which wasn't quite medium rare, but still tasty. \n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed the tiramisu and key lime pie were VERY VERY good. \n\nIt's a short walk away from our apartment, and most DEFINITELY a restaurant that we plan on being regulars of. I love everything from the food to the service to the ambiance -- they are doing it all right!", "author": "Shu Jin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "I only dined here once or twice, the food is good but they rush you out and the tables are too close for comfort.

My g/f and I have a nice meal at the bar - I had a fish special (Hake) and she had two apps as a meal (meatballs, and octopus).  All were yummy, and arrived quickly.  Lots of flavor and well-presented simple meals helped.\n\nOne point about our spot - we were near where lots of cocktails were made, so we would often get the aroma of muddled mint, or lime, or whatever else they used.  While nice, it did interrupt our food smells, which were pleasant by themselves.\n\nService was good and attentive.  I had a nice Six Points beer/lager.\nFor the meal and good tip for two, I paid $85 (special, two apps, and a beer, all plus tip).", "author": "Liam R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-11", "description": "Amazing food, adorable corner spot, great people!

The place was packed but the hostess and bartender kept an eye out for seats at the bar. Me and my guest were seated within 15 minutes of entering the place. \nThe service was great. I had the deep fried pulled pork fritters as my appetizer and pan seared catfish and red cabbage for my entree. I wasn't a fan of the fritters as they were a bit bland and a bit too much for me to eat. The catfish was marinated perfectly and was delicious.\n\nI will definitely be back.", "author": "Nikki H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-22", "description": "Yum and cool. 20 minute wait on a Saturday was expected but we took seats at the bar to get in early.

The service is stellar. (How do the servers memorize the names of six oyster varietals and their various flavor attributes?) The decor is charming. The value is good. The food is creative and it definitely hits that mark of accessible dishes just beyond your reach as a chef: Really great ingredients prepared with creativity, skill, and thoughtfulness. \n\nWe shared:\n\n8 oysters (four each of two varietals so we each tried two oysters of the same variety so we could really, really taste all those attributes)\nBar steak with frites: This is a skirt steak, marinated tender, perfectly prepared, and served atop a small, dressed arugula salad. It was a contemporary successor to what Sammy's Romanian served decades ago. \nKale Caesar Salad\nBrussels sprouts: flash deep fried and server in vinegar-based \"Vietnam\" sauce that probably included some sriracha and aleppo pepper.\nApple-cranberry cobbler: We couldn't find the cranberries but we loved, loved, loved it. A delightful dessert in a cereal bowl served steaming hot and topped with what tasted more like a biscuit or scone dough than one usually used for cobbler. \nTwo glasses of sauvignon blanc brought the bill to $100 before tip. \n\nBONUS: Frites condiments include mayo and mustard in addition to the classic ketchup. \n\nBONUS: Amazing oyster sauces! Strategically, we ate our oysters just with lemon to get all the flavors, and samples the sauces alone.", "author": "Steve N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-18", "description": "Wow what happened though? \nFood was terrible*, drinks were \nSub-par**Huge bummer\n\n*\"pork belly\" was an over cooked pork chop \n**fix your martini olive game ASAP", "author": "ReviewHaiku F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-29", "description": "Popular little brunch spot in Brooklyn.

So we proceed to dinner number 2: Walters in Fort Green. Walters has been my favorite watering hole for in Williamsburg for a few years now. So right when I walk in, I was delighted to see the same Latin American gentlemen that has been treating me well in the OG spot for two years. I've watched with this server since he was a pup; and I'm so happy to see him now as a seasoned pro. The two other servers were also on point.

What a lucky find!! Walters is all you can ask for!! Great ambience,  personable  bartenders,... Alejandro and Ruben, AMAZING food!! We started with the raw bar!! Fresh, cold, delicious!!
