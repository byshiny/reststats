The bread here is amazing! I had a Brie and Apple sandwich that was perfect. When I saw the cookbooks and talked to the server I realized I was in one of the best bakeries in NYC. Hand made, fresh ingredients, loads of care and consideration to detail.

This looks like a small local business, surely people will take their custom elsewhere if she keeps speaking with her mouth full, and is unintelligible when she does speak", "author": "Nik W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-08", "description": "Lovely new bakery in the old Tazza space. I was pretty bummed when Tazza closed, having spent many hours there with a stroller parked next to me. The newly reopened space is reconfigured but also welcoming and will hopefully have outdoor seating during warm weather. Most importantly the breads are fantastic. I've stopped by a few times and have tried a variety of baked goods at this point and none have disappointed.", "author": "Lana V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-02", "description": "Really excited to have a new bakery and bagel source in this corner of Brooklyn Heights.\n\nStopped in today for a coffee, and I picked up a loaf of sourdough and a flatbread snack. All delicious, and the price was entirely (and surprisingly!) reasonable.

Finally a real bakery in this neighbourhood! I visited the first time today around 5:30 and took advantage of their buy 1 get 1 free deal.

Good selections of pastries, cakes, and breads. Tried their new goat cheese sandwich -- omg, so delicious. Staff was sweet and service was fast.

When I got home and took it out of the bag, before 8:30, I found the crust dry and hard ... to the point that it could be torn away in big pieces, stiff and sturdy.  The crumb was not much better.\n\nIsn't the crust supposed to be flaky and the crumb moist?\n\nAnd where's the butter?\n\nOh, it's bitterly salty.\n\nI obtained a second opinion, just in case my senses were on strike today.
