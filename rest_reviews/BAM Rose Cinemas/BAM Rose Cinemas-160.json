I love the ambiance. Prima! I loved them enough to become a level II member. I have a few things that just drive me crazy though. \n1. You're an art house cinema. Why are you serving Regal Cinema Yellow No. 5 popcorn?\n2. Your cinema club is such a great idea, but managed in such a haphazard ridiculous way, where do I start? Half of it is online. 1/3 of it is managed by a 3rd party. 1/3 of it never answers the phone and keeps 9-5 hours. 100% is still sent by mail? Why, if I'm allowed to buy membership online, and you have a numeric receipt system, do I then have to wait 2 weeks before I can get discounted tickets? This is a movie, not elective surgery. Just print the membership number out in the receipt email? Why on earth don't you do that? Why must I wait until Monday, to call....to get a temp pass? \n\nThat's it. The rest is love.

My last two visits were to see the Alvin Ailey dancers, and then to see the Dance Africa performance this past spring.

They show new movies, some that are not in wide release around the city, special features, and programs on different cinematic themes or works by a specific director or star (I think they call these \"cinematheque\"). \n\nI remember when they did the massive renovations at BAM and opened the movie theater and re-did the performance space and they really did a great job. There are 3 screens, good but expensive popcorn (it's still a movie theater even if it's a good one), and I have it on good account that they sell decent coffee. \n\nThe prices are around a dollar cheaper than you'll find at the Court Street Regal and theaters in Manhattan, plus it's just a nicer movie-going experience and you can see things that aren't playing anywhere else in Brooklyn, except maybe at the Brooklyn Heights Twin. Instead of tons of talking and people yelling \"oh snap!\" and \"don't open that door!\" people actually come to watch the movie and not just provide commentary. You can also become a member, I think for $75 a year, and buy $7 or $8 tickets with your card.", "author": "Sam F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-29", "description": "Really beautiful building with 4 theaters inside, concession booth, all the amenities of any big movie theater except they play foreign films!

It is a very funny and very weird little something, written by Jules Feiffer and directed by Alan Arkin, that contains great moments of Beckett-like absurdity set against an early 70s NYC milieu.)\n\nMr. Gould was very nice, responding to certain film nerd queries in a pleasant manner and with an earnestness he need not have employed.  After the q \u0026 a, we filtered into the lobby for open bar and a mingling.  This is where my story occurs.\n\nNow, let me preface the following with a little description of my friend Pauly.  I love the guy and I owe him eternally for his years of friendship but he tends to get himself into awkwardly hilarious situations with disturbing frequency.  The reason for this is that he is is the nicest human being you will ever meet but also exceptionally nerdy. His wife allows him a room in the house for his vast collection of action figures and he has an array of busts of Marvel superheroes arranged on his mantel, so I think we can all agree that I have offered a fair and accurate description. \n\nFurther, both Pauly and myself have a slightly odd obsession with the work of Mr. Gould.  The source can be traced mostly to his work with the director Robert Altman (i.e. M*A*S*H and THE LONG GOODBYE).  However, you cannot discount his turn as Ross and Rachel's dad on FRIENDS, an under-appreciated gem of a performance.  \n\nWhile I am at it, a succinct description of Mr. Gould ca. 2009: attired in trousers hiked above his navel and a wool cardigan, he currently bears a more than passing resemblance to a kindly old Jewish grandfather.   \n\nSo, we are mingling in the lobby of BAM and fortifying ourselves with alcoholic beverages.  Pauly \u0026 I are hovering near Mr. Gould, slowly getting drunker and waiting for the moment we can approach him and, surely, impress him with our knowledge of Altman so that he quickly becomes enamored with us and we are the best of friends for all time.  That is the plan, at least.\n\nTime progresses and Pauly \u0026 I are now well past the point of mild inebriation.  We see our opening and walk over, shaking hands with our admired future-friend and introducing ourselves.  We stick to our Christian names for the moment, assuming that he will assign us special nicknames at some point in our impending BBFdom.\n\nThis is when it happens, that magical you-had-to-be-there apex of awkwardness: Pauly launches into a long, involved description of a Batman comic book.  \n\n(Later, during the first of many reconstructions of this event, it is determined that something in the comic reminded him of LITTLE MURDERS, the film we had just seen, though Pauly failed to mention that critical fact during the actual conversation.  I believe the comic in question was BATMAN: GOTHAM KNIGHTS but I am not absolutely certain.)\n\nMr. Gould listened patiently to this unnecessarily detailed, nay unnecessary on every conceivable level, description of a comic book for a full five (5!) minutes before politely excusing himself.  I stood mute witness to the entire glorious exchange and I cherish the memory.", "author": "Christopher R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-22", "description": "I became a member of BAM and its one of the best things I've done that has helped me enjoy Brooklyn more.

You can never time it to miss the previews. Sometimes the previews start before the written show time and sometimes after. This means if you are five minutes late you could be missing the first part of the film.\n\nCinemas 3 and 4 are the larger theaters with the bigger screens and have that old theater grand movie experience. Cinemas 1 and 2 are much smaller and have the art house cinema feel and because they are small you better get to the movie on time.

The theaters are large and generally quite comfortable (a sold out weekend show in the largest theater being an exception) and the picture and sound quality are well above average.  \n\nMinor gripes: $12 movies, no more batch candy (what happened, BAM?) and only average popcorn.

Unlike BAM HARVEY, where I've never seen anything I didn't like, I've only ever seen one thing I actually liked at BAM OPERA... \n\nI came here a few times a few years ago, a couple times a couple years ago, and I've been here twice in the past week. Way back when I went bonkers for \"Sasha Waltz: Impromptu\" (which was the only dance performance that's ever made me cry -- it was harrowing), b\n\nThe two things I saw this week both had me rolling my eyes and actually contemplating leaving... \"Woyzeck\" was absolutely massacered -- it was more Cirque de Soleil and Stomp and Blue Man Group and Cabaret than it was Georg B\u00fcchner, I hated it -- being faitful to the text or even the story was the last thing on their mind... \n\nAnd then there's the Steve Reich/Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker/Rosas I saw the other night: they butchered Pendulum Phase (rushing it's ending, completely murdering the entire concept of the piece), the two women dancing along to Piano Phase was a moment of genius (the overlapping shadow-play was stunning), Marimba Phase was interesting but nothing special, Eight Lines had sloppy unfocused dancing, Four Organs had absolutely terrible technically hilarious dancing, Drumming Part 1 was just uninspired and redundant dance-wise, and last but not least I was mortified by their treatment of Ligeti's \"Po\u00e8me symphonique pour cent m\u00e9tronomes\" -- rather than starting them all simultaneously a few \"fierce\" dancers \"preciously\" started them individually, and metronomes weren't all the way wound, and you could barely hear them, it was used almost as an intermission... No intermissions, a pitch-black auditorium, you couldn't leave if you wanted to... \n\nAnd then there's the Pina Bausch \"dream-scapes\" nightmare, but I'd rather forget about it.", "author": "David L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-24", "description": "My friend and I were lucky enough to get discounted tickets for \"As You Like It\" and were worried our rear orchestra seats would have a pole in front of me blocking the view.\n\nHowever, when we entered the venue, I was surprised how intimate the setting was compared to other theater venues I've attended in the past.  \n\nIt was my first time at BAM and I admired the rather unfinished look it had with the exposed brick, beams and the rusty looking ceiling.\n\nThe cafe is also simple sellling sandwiches, water and coffee but you're really there for the show.
