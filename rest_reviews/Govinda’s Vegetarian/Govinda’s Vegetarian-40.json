Now that I've tried it on a day off, I really wish this was near my work because it's a perfect midday meal/mental break type of place - affordable, quick, friendly and low-key. I split a $12 complete lunch and a $2 extra side with another person, and we were both full. The food has a home-cooked taste and seems free of excessive grease and salt that you sometimes get with commercial kitchens. Decor is simple but has a welcoming vibe.  \n\nIf you're put off from trying it only because you imagine sticking out among a crowd of robed hippie types, don't be. There was a variety of people from the community eating there and the guy serving our lunch was so beaming and friendly that it kind of made my day.", "author": "Zoey F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-16", "description": "Govinda's is the type of place you'd never expect to find in NYC, with the added benefit of actually being *IN* NYC. \nA true hidden gem, nestled in the basement of a Hare Krishna temple in downtown Brooklyn, Govinda's offers top notch food made with love at prices fit for a pauper's wallet.\nGV has a constantly revolving menu, so don't expect the same thing twice!

The Eggplant Parm is an amazing choice though they did change it so it's mainly served on Thursdays rather than Thursdays and Fridays. Definitely get there early because they may run out of things you like but stuff is constantly being brought out from the kitchen so there's a lot for you to try. Their curry-style potatos are great, the cabbage meatballs are kind of meh for me, and a lot of the other dishes (too many to name) are good. Their desserts, namely their Cheesecake is absolutely delicious. I think it's better than Junior's. The one with homemade whipped cream and blueberry compote is definitely a must try and the portion is huge.", "author": "Brandon Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-21", "description": "I feel like I've just hit the jackpot.\n\nAnd by jackpot, I mean I've discovered delicious, cheap, fresh food in the most unexpected place imaginable. Yes, I'm talking about in the basement of a hare krishna temple. Don't you just love that?\n\nYou can wander past this place without doing a double take. There's no large neon sign. No flyers. No people advertising outside. It's good ol' fashioned word-of-mouth marketing and of course many thanks to all of you. When you walk in, look past the man that sits by the door and past the temple services and to your right you will find Govinda's. Picture this: Walk down a flight of stairs into what looks like a much-needed-rennovation space that reminds me of an older catering hall/cafeteria. The walls are a interesting shade of green and it's a veryyyy casual atmosphere. And..... I love all of it. \n\nThe staff here is incredibly friendly and always have a smile on their faces. If you look at the sign on the wall (see picture) it'll tell you the price breakdown. Everything is made that day (buffet style) and fresh out of the kitchen. Their desserts for the most part are vegan so if you have dietary restrictions, always ask! They're very accommodating. \n\nAs for the food. Holy cow (irony, I know) this stuff is GOOD. No GREAT. They offer vegetarian/vegan options without sacrificing any flavor. I've been able to each lunch here (Mon-Fri 12:00-3:30pm) a few times and their star dish IMO has to be the eggplant parm. It's not your traditional eggplant parm by any means in that there's a underlying hint of curry with every bite. Super \"meaty\" and cheesy. I've also had their: pumpkin soup, quinoa salad, curry chickpeas, roasted curry potatoes/veggies, vegan cookies and cupcakes. Their meals come with their own homemade multigrain bread which is pretty stellar like everything else. \n\nNot only are the portions pretty hefty (I have yet to finish my full lunch), but they're very reasonably priced. Everything I've had here has been nothing short of amazing. I'm looking forward to becoming one of their \"regulars\". \n\n***TIP! Their daily offerings are usually posted on their facebook page.

Part of me wants it to remain it's beautiful little secret. However, I'm on yelp to share the secrets with my friends. \n\nI am a pescatarian but love going strict vegetarian. Govinda's is the best place to be vegetarian. Vegetarian here does not mean grease, cheese or processed. Quiet the contrary, everything I have here taste delicious and utilizes, grains and vegetables with spices. You will find some cheese sometimes and it is still delicious!\n\nThe portions are always generous. I do 3 sides and sometimes I can't even finish my plate. I always do 2 warm sides and a salad. The salad always has options of toppings such as beets with feta. Yes and Yes!! One Friday I came and as if they were waiting for me. I ordered the eggplant parmesan. There was a roasted cauliflower side and the salad with beets and feta. All ingredients I love! The eggplant was perfection! Sometimes I come here specifically for eggplant. \n\nThe menu is always changing. I have been there a number of times and still manage to try something new. It's delicious, cheap, filing and you will leave here happy! \n\nThe secret is officially out!", "author": "Carolina S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-30", "description": "Extremely affordable; homemade and delicious.  This was a fantastic find on a cold a Friday afternoon.  Don't skip dessert. While the bread looked bland it was sweet and wonderful.  Juice was like tang and the soup tasted watery.  Music and ambience a little headache producing, for me.  But overall, pretty darn awesome.  The main corses kept me full all day.  A great value and cultural experience unlike any I've experienced.  Apple pie worthy of return visits.  Yum!  Cheap!  Outstanding cultural experience!

Doesn't seem like a restaurant at first but if you go downstairs you'll find a very low key cafeteria. The portions are generous and the food is authentic.

UPDATE: They did get back to me.\n\nAs for the review of the place/food itself - as everyone has noted its in the basement of a temple. Very plain and almost cafeteria / soup kitchen setting. There's a small section with the food that is served buffet style (CASH ONLY). Everything is vegan/vegetarian and the menu changes daily. Thursdays and Fridays are the most popular days because those are the days they serve eggplant parmesan.\n\nThe food itself is affordable - $4 for one item, $6 for 2 items and $7 for one item with 3 sides. There's an $8 and $10 option as well and they give you a good amount of food. $4 for cake and $1 for cookies\n\nIt was a little confusing though because given their menu I should've been able to get 2 eggplant parms for $6 but was told I would have to pay $8 if I did that. The wording of the menu did not make that clear at all.\n\nSERVICE:\nThere's a woman there who was very friendly and pleasant, but there was also a guy there helping her who had a sourpuss face, unfriendly demeanor and nasty attitude. He made me feel uncomfortable every time I went up to look at the food (I got some food to go at the end of my meal) and made me not want to go back.\n\nWhile he was already in a sour mood before I had any interaction with him, I think the later bad vibes he sent my way stemmed from the fact that I handed him money over the counter and instead of him looking to see that there were quarters in my hand he simply dragged the money out of my hand, which resulted in some quarters ending up in the quinoa. \n\nHe looked annoyed at me even though had he been paying attention he could have avoided that accident. (p.s. - he didn't change the quinoa container after picking the quarters out. EEK!)\n\nTIP #1: If you have t-mboile there's no internet connection in the basement\nTIP #2: CASH ONLY!\nTIP #3: Go on eggplant day (Thursday and Friday) but go early because it's their busiest day and they do sell out\n\nMajor gripes - very short operating hours, they do run out of the stuff you want, and the line can get really long", "author": "Camille H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-15", "description": "The place was pretty nice lol. When I saw that the place was described as a cafeteria, I was worried that it was gonna look like those cafeteria's from my high school years. Those brought horrid memories especially with the food. CRY. Fortunately, it wasn't like that, phew\n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is at the basement [lol, dont be creeped out]. It has a classy, nice yet casual cafeteria-ish type of dining area. There is a wall painting of a Hindu god, a few chandeliers, a couple of cute flower decorations! Hahaha, see? Now that's seems pretty nice.\n\nFood: Everything is VEGETARIAN! Their small menu changes daily. However, their menu items range from decent-delicious. It's also very recently-good priced ESPECIALLY THE WHOLE MEAL VERSION! Ooh, btw get the FREE drinks at the end of the food ordering line: i love the green mint iced tea [trust me so refreshing!!!] \n\nPrice: Very cheap-reasonable! At most, for a whole meal, you'll probably pay like around $13 for a huge meal! The whole entre came with a salad too. ;D\n\nWorkers: The servers are really nice and friendly.
