Exactly what a diner should be. Go here for breakfast, lunch, or late night. Never a problem waiting or with the food here.", "author": "Chris K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-22", "description": "This place is convenient, huge (never a wait for a table), and cheap. it looks like it could be a set for a diner. they have all types and configurations of tables, one for every possible size group. many are booths, and they seat small parties at large booths when it's not busy - that always feels a little luxurious, even if you're sitting on a plastic bench cushion. \n\nThis place's best point in my opinion is that they have fantastic hot chocolate. It comes from a machine, and I don't know what they do to it to make it so good, but it's addictive. I usually wind up having two, even so far this summer when it's been 95 and humid. \n\nMy wife would probably say that her favorite aspect is that she almost never has to look around and flag someone down to bring here more coffee, they just come past with more all the time. \n\nI've come here maybe 10 times since the spring, after never going there for the first two years I lived in the neighborhood. I usually get breakfast food - had a couple omelettes, which have been decent (though not always exactly what I ordered - they've put raw mushrooms in place of the cooked portabellos I requested, and regular tomatoes rather than cherry; on the one hand, those are not listed as omelette toppings, but on the other hand they are listed as toppings/ingredients for sandwiches and salads, so why preclude their use in omelettes?). I've gotten some good croissants and some dry ones that were probably left over from previous days - hit or miss on that score. \n\nMy go-to is the monte cristo club - a french toast triple-decker with ham, turkey, and cheese. It's weird, they always use significantly more turkey than ham or cheese (I'd prefer a different ratio, but not trying to make trouble here). It comes with (good) french fries and (always, for some reason) two onion rings. It's a gut-busting sandwich, so I usually have half, and then finish off the fries and take the other half home for a later meal.\n\nMy wife likes the homefries (and the french fries - it's a pattern) and she is always eager to go here. I'm skeptical about the cleanliness - the last time I went, my menu seemed sticky. The neighborhood offers tons of diner options, but I have a feeling we'll be back here.", "author": "Josef K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-03", "description": "Classic diner...

It's a diner! That's what it's been for years, and that's what it is still. It still has the same quality food as it's always had. They thought by changing the name from diner to restaurant, and updating the decor, it might fool somebody.  Wrong. What it needs to do is cut that ridiculously large menu in half, focus more on the quality of food, and it might get better business as well as reviews. The only thing it has going for them is its late hours and delivery. I've been eating here for over 15 years and honestly nothing has changed, and it's sad. I've been holding off on this review hoping the food would change, but it hasn't, and I continue to find myself disappointed. On top of the terrible quality, they are also way overpriced. If happy days was closer I'd go there instead, and their food sucks too. Lucky for park plaza, they get my business because I'm too lazy to walk 3 blocks for crap food. The only reason I've given 3 stars is because of their quick delivery, and the massive variety of food they have, although I said it kills the quality of food having so many options, but none the less is convenient when you order delivery.", "author": "Jake S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-24", "description": "I ate at this restaurant for the first time yesterday and I was so amazed at the taste of the food, the presentation and how quickly it arrived. My boyfriend and I ate at the bar/lounge side of the restaurant and the area was clean, well ventilated and our waitress was so friendly. I began my meal with the loaded nachos and they use a mix of yellow, red and blue corn tortilla chips. This was the first restaurant that actually meant LOADED Nachos. They included an awesome guacamole, onions, peppers, jalape\u00f1os, chili, shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream, and a bunch of other things I'm sure I'm forgetting to mention. My boyfriend ordered the wings with the angel of death sauce. This was the first time he had ever gotten hot wings that lived up to its name. Since we went during happy hour the wings were 50 cents a piece. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar salad and was so happy with the amount chicken they gave me. It was a large grilled chicken breast which covered the diameter of the bowl it was served in. The grilled chicken warmed the bed of lettuce so nicely. The greens were tossed in Caesar dressing, garlic and I'm sure grated Parmesan cheese. All there of these items left us with a bill of 27 which wasn't bad at all!!! I would surely eat there again.", "author": "La'Donnia P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-08", "description": "I felt like I was in my own rendition of Back to the Future.  Super friendly service, really cheap food, and 1980's wood/leather decor.  The food was fine (omelet, pancakes) but the service is really friendly.

Great place to eat when you're in the mood for... almost anything. \n\nThe menu is ridiculous. In addition to their 40+ breakfast options (served anytime), they also offer everything from paninis to burgers to braised lamb shanks to pulled pork. It will take you a few minutes to run through your options. Depending on your choice, you can get fed well for anywhere from $7 to $20. Not bad. \n\nI love any restaurant that gives you a small plate of noshes while you're waiting for your order. We got a plate with potato and macaroni salads, hummus, pickles and olives.

I have to start out with the positive, the waitress, and manager were very apologetic and willing to correct any issues.  So, first things first:  my sister has been talking about how yummy the grill cheese is at the Park Plaza for two days.  She finally orders it, it arrives with a long hair peeking out of the cheesy center.  The waitress barely put the plate down, when my sister noticed.  Back it went!  The second grill cheese came out with American instead of Cheddar. Back it went!  The third and final grill cheese wasn't melted, but it was too exhausting to send it back.  So, the rest of us had no issue with our food...until...there it was, a piece of paper baked into my pancake! Ugh!  A million thoughts floated thru my mind, about the life that piece of paper may have had before finding it's final resting place in my pancake!  The manager said he thinks a piece of the bag fell in, when they added the mix to the mixer.  He did comp both meals.  Meanwhile my husband sat happily with his French Toast and Gyro meat.
