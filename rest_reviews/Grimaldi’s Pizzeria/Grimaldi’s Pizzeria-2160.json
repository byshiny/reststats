Naturally, we know our pizzas just as well as we know our bagels.  This is the real deal.  \n\nI found out with pizza as fresh and as delicious as theirs, it's better to order less toppings to taste the classic ingredients (bc they are THAT good) and too much ingredients might weigh down the thin crust and mask the simple goodness of  tomato sauce, mozz, and basil.  I get extra cheese, my bf gets sun-dried tomatoes. But that's it, no more extras.  I did try the pepperoni once and its good, but I prefer margherita.\n\nI don't indulge too often on fast food, but when I do, I make sure I take a trip to Grimaldis if it is pizza I am craving because polishing off half a large pie is worth the expanded waistline and the wait.  However, I skipped the wait when they opened up one in Queens.", "author": "Jamlen F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-24", "description": "Yesh, you have to wait in line sometimes for an hour or more\nYesh, its touristy sometimes\nYesh, its the best pizza in NYC", "author": "Sumit D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-21", "description": "Went last night with friends and waited on line for 1hr 10mins..finally got in and got a large pie, half pepperoni and half mushroom with sausage. When it came i realized how thin it was..im a fan of both thick and thin pizza's but this was just ridiculous. It was paper thin and the crust was totally burnt because of how thin it was. The cheese and toppings just felt apart when we picked it up because the slice was so god dam thin..some parts were crispy like a thin cracker when you bite into it. And that's something i don't want in a pizza.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it wasn't too bad taste-wise, but it was just way way way..too thin. The sausage especially was really good, but i didn't taste much of the mushrooms. Since it's paper thin, each person would probably have to eat 4 slices AT LEAST to actually be full. All and all, its ok, give it a try..but i don't think its worth the 1hr 10min+ wait. If you pass by and there's a short line or no line then ok give it a try. Other than that it's not worth waiting almost 2hrs for. Just imagine a piece of paper with toppings thrown unevenly on top and as you pick it up / fold it, everything just falls out.", "author": "Carol R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-07", "description": "Well its an OK pizza not worth my two hours I tell you...TWO FREAKING HOURS IN LINE!!!!! no way I'm glad we went to get it out of our systems. Service is fast and pizzas don't take long at all. Thin crust oven brick cooked pizza had Margarita, pepperoni and white pizza with sun dried tomatoes. Best one Margarita pizza tomato sauce has a good flavor. Why three stars, because if i had to go to this place without the f....ing line might have been three and a half. But for white pizza Pizza CS in Maryland wins it all for me.

This place has some delicious pizza!  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because theirs often a loooong wait for a table.\nThe owner is a patient at my dental office and he's a sweetheart!  He treats us to dinners here often and I'm very eager to accept!  Why not!? It's the famous Grimaldis afterall and my belly is always so happy to accept!

They say less is more on their pizzas.  I've gotten a red-sauce pizza both times I've gone since they import their tomatoes from Italy, and I wanted to have a authentic pizza experience.  I got mushroom as a topping, which I wouldn't recommend it made the pizza extra soggy from the water in the mushrooms, and the mushrooms are in more of a raw state then a good browned baked state.  Environment is cool.  Get there early before the main meal times cause lines get long.  They are pretty quick if it's just two people.  Two people can easily eat a small pizza which consists of 6 Huge slices.  Don't take leftovers they'll just get soggy, but its good enough to eat it all there and be a little extra full.", "author": "Laura B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-29", "description": "Thumbs way up! This place is not famous without reason- great pizza, fresh toppings, (super lethal spicy jalape\u00f1os ) and vintage feel. I also really like their ricotta cheese, and fresh basil.
