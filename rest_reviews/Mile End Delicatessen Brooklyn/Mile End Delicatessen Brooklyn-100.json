Quite filling and heavy breakfast options. Didn't rest well in my stomach but was thoroughly enjoyable to eat.

We just stuck with the classic as a side to the smoked meat sandwich (which beware has mustard on it! My boyfriend nearly had a meltdown) and brisket hash (delicious). But my mouth watered watching the specialty poutines being prepared, especially the Greek. Snag a spot at the bar if you can... It overlooks the open kitchen so you can watch the cooks do their thing.

The beef was mainly chunks of fatty beef with very little meat.  Charged extra $4 for coleslaw side dish.

So what's the problem, you ask? The soup was 9 f*$%#ing dollars! The sandwich was 12 F\u0026*^%ing dollars- now if this were like Carnegie or Katz where you get a giant matzo ball or more then 1/4 lb of meat- i'd be thrilled, but they're nuts with these prices. JEEZ. I've gotten better value at a 4 star celebrity steak house in Vegas. \n\nMy grandpa passed this year :( and I haven't had a decent jewish meal since- but if she saw what I paid for mediocre food- she'd turn over in her grave. You can do so much better with any other jewish deli or if you need delivery- definitely go with a diner that will rival the quality of this food for way better value.", "author": "Bethany W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-30", "description": "Overpriced.

There are 3 big communal tables/benches and a few bar seats and due to the nature of the setup, you'll leave smelling like fried food.\n\nI had the latke and schnitzel sandwich and a try of the smoked meat burger. The latkes and schnitzel were tiny. For $16, I'd expect a side or something. It's literally, potatoes and 2 small pieces of chicken. Why is it so pricey? My latkes were burnt and the aftertaste was pretty bad. The poutine was relatively good but again, overpriced.

Good service, good food, and a good night. \n\nTwo people seated in the front of the cooks. These guys honestly look like average joes, but they were very open to conversation and advice. Very modest too, and their prep methods actually differ slightly. The waitress was patient and efficient, though we didn't give her much trouble ordering. The menu was small and it was easy to order a variety. We had chopped liver, small classic poutine, smoked meat sandwich, and beats with smoked whitefish. \n\nThe chopped liver and poutine was served very quickly. Poutine was average. The fries were average, gravy was average(tho very warm), but the cheese curds were awesome. Big chunky and very close to melting point, making the poutine truly a poutine. I've never had chopped liver, but this was a pleasant experience. The bread and pickled veggies accompaniment was perfect. The buttered bread and liver were very similar to eating tuna on a cracker, but more refined as it should be. Beats and smoked fish was very unique, definitely have to try it, and I hate most veggies! \n\nLastly the smoked meat sandwich. Glorious, glorious smoked meat. It can give Schwartz a run for their money. This is where the chef prepared ours with the fat, which I love, but depending on the chef, they cut it off due to controversy on fat.

And great for sharing! I had the broussel sprouts and I wasn't the biggest fan.

It was overfried fries soaking in the gravy, with curds. The fries were rock hard, to the point that spearing them with a fork was impossible.  They were nice enough to let me have my fois gras shavings - or dust -  on the side, but the foie amounted to something like a teaspoon full  (not a rounded teanspoon, but a level one). C'mon guys, I know foie is pricey, but not THAT pricey.  And what's the point of adding them as a feature if you can't even taste them?
