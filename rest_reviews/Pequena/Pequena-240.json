The food is delicious, and the place has a great vibe. \n\nThe chips (they have this great spicy rub) and pico are fantastic, and of entrees, I think their enchiladas are best. The beans, rice, and guac are all solid, so really you can't go wrong here. \n\nIt's sometimes quite crowded (it is quite pequena, after all) but the decor is really fun and the vibe cool. Plus, although things used to move slowly, it's clear they've recently hired more waitstaff because there are new faces and much faster service.", "author": "Miriam G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-09", "description": "I like Peque\u00f1a because it is delicious and satisfies 2 picky neighborhood eaters.

The broth was rich, clear, and clean with generous hunks of avocado and refreshing bits of tomatoes, corn, red onion and sour cream... What really stood out was that the chicken in the soup was shockingly tender and moist- not dry or rubbery like many other places. SO GOOD\n\nI also had the sauteed fish tacos that were simple and delicious. You can really taste the ingredients, nothing overpowered by sauce although it could use more salt. Rice and beans were average, portion size is great!\n\nI went on a Friday night, place was totally packed. The hostess and staff were incredibly personable and friendly accommodating our large party of 6.

But listen, the appetizer platter was gargantuan; the guacamole was fresh and tasty, even the home made chips were crisp and tasty (a word that I'm not tossing around; it WAS tasty; it retained a clear taste of parsley and olive oil embedded in the corn), and we didn't even noticed at which point of digestion our stomachs had assimilated this as the ONLY course of the evening; needless to say, when they brought my again-gargantuan platter of chicken fajitas, I cursed in protest since they were delicious and I couldn't even finish 15% of my plate. MiG kept reassuring me, but I felt guilty; perhaps I should have **dare I say it?** taken a doggy bag??!! No. Never. I don't believe in re-heated food, and apparently neither does MiG; her mushroom tacos, which the waitress told us were going to be prepared again due to the fact that they were cold, magically reappeared on our table in a count of 10.... a microwave parlor? perhaps, but nevertheless, Pequenia does in fact stay true to her name (means small in Spanish feminine) in terms of location, but NOT in terms of food. The platters are simply gigantic; this is the kind of place you come when you are totally famished or after fasting. \n\nOne last observation, hanging in the wall there were several Mexican skeletonshttp://www.ghostdroppings.com/images/photodroppings/PileOfMiniSkulls.jpg ; just like the ones you see in Frida Kahlo's paintings; they have always reminded me of black magic and creepy portents, this day was no exception as our small White Sangria Carafe kept refilling itself magically even after we had served ourselves several glasses (great sangria btw)... but hey, if portents are bent on making me drink, then by all means you little devils; replenish my Carafe to infinity for all I care! \n\n**bias switch off**\n\n**Special thanks to MiG for pointing out (much to my embarrasment) that we had in FACT drank Sangria NOT Mojitos; I blame the devil urchins and their black magic though**", "author": "Javier M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-24", "description": "the name is no joke, this place is tiny.\n\nhowever, the food is so good. i could probably eat every meal here and not ever feel bad about it.

This place is always crowded, and I don't understand why.  I had a date here, and it took alot to prevent me from wanting to gag.  The chicken tacos were inedible.  Chockfull of grease.

I will also say up front that coming from Colorado, I have a different reference point for what constitutes good Mexican and Pequena, mi amigo, just ain't it. I ordered the chili relleno, or maybe it was pork enchiladas, it doesn't matter cuz it was COLD! I mean El Dia de los Muertos COLD. I didn't even want to send it back to heat it up because it wasn't good anyway. They do have some things going for them: the decor is fetching and the guacamole is actually quite good.
