Ingredients were all fresh, and pizza came straight from the oven.

There was a 15-20 min wait outside to order takeout or eat in. We finally sat down and got a table. The employees were extremely rude!!!! I got a small pizza with half pepperoni. The cheese wasn't throughly melted on the pizza \u0026 it was hard to bare through my half of the pie.. This place was extremely hyped up. I don't plan on going back. BTW: They only take cash \u0026 they don't sell slices only pies !", "author": "Bria M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-08", "description": "What a major disappointment!!! Went there this past Saturday, to my surprise I was in one of the dirtiest pizzeria.  I have know clue why people are still talking about Grimaldi's.  Service, food and atmosphere GROSS!", "author": "Vikki C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-02", "description": "Got in right on time before it got packed. \n\nTHE AMBIANCE:\n\nGrimaldi's is one of those pizzerias where you feel like you just walked into your grandparent's house. Dough smell in the air, cozy, and very welcoming. This spot is two (2) stories by way of a staircase on the back right. We sat at a half booth half table space. The seat was ripped up but I thought it gave the place character. The tables are not very spacious because they pack a lot of people in. Ten (10) minutes after being seated the place started getting packed for lunch. There was not a table in sight that was unoccupied. The women's restroom is located on the left of the staircase. \n\nTHE PIZZA:\n\nWe ordered a meat lovers pizza with ricotta. I LOVE ricotta so I was very happy. The pizza came out hot and the flavors were there. The only thing I noted was that the mozzarella, when cold, started getting a bit rubbery and they don't have a cheese shaker on the table; they do have a garlic shaker, though, which was neat. The crust of the pizza comes out thin. I enjoyed it.\n\nTHE ALCOHOL LICENSE:\n\nNon-existent, which is a bummer! I wanted a nice, cold beer with my slice. Word on the street is that it's been \"pending\" for over one (1) year.\n\nTHE TIPS:\n\nA line will start forming outside of the building.", "author": "Paola N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-13", "description": "We came here at noon on Father's Day and got very lucky that there was no long line outside. We were seated upstairs right away and the pizza was out of this world, but they either have no AC or it wasn't on and the heat was brutal. Definitely makes it difficult to enjoy a meal when you're so uncomfortable and sweating from the heat. Also be aware that they only take cash, we weren't aware of this until we saw it printed on the menu but thankfully we ended up having enough cash on us. But the pizza really is outstanding.", "author": "Lauren M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-20", "description": "Word on the street is that Grimaldi sold his restaurant to someone back in the day but change his mind and wanted to open another restaurant. Since he sold the rights to his name, he opened another restaurant down the street from this place- Juliana's. And now Grimaldi's is a franchised chain. HAD I KNOWN THIS EARLIER, I would've eaten at Juliana's instead of this place. \n\nGrimaldi's was very pretty disappointing. The dough tasted undercooked, the tomato sauce was really watery (making the pizza very soggy), the cheese tasted like plastic, the sun-dried tomatoes didn't taste normal (not in a good way), etc. It can get pricy since you pay for each additional topping and it doesn't matter if it's half of the pizza or the whole thing. Even though the large (8 slices) is only $2 more than the small, I'd stick with the small size for two people.\n\nNote: CASH ONLY!", "author": "Ashley C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-12-28", "description": "Went back after many many years to enjoy pizza. I was extremely disappointed with the  quality and taste. Dough was mushy and tomato sauce was average.

Patrons have been known to praise the pizza. Unfortunately, I was not impressed.\n\nPrices are very reasonable - a small cheese pizza for $12, large for $14, and $3 for additional toppings.The pizza was crispy and thin with a bit of char - great. But...the pizza was dry and lacked full flavor. I was expecting a classic, flavorful, slightly greasy Neapolitan style pie. This was not it. \n\nAlso, the place is in disrepair. The ceiling plaster is falling off and wallpaper is peeling, especially in the women's bathroom, which was overflowing with trash onto the floor.\n\nUnless you are in Brooklyn for another reason, don't waste your time coming from Manhattan to patronize this place. There is much better Neapolitan pizza elsewhere.", "author": "Melanie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-20", "description": "Between this and Julianas (next door) there's always a line of 30 people deep. My boyfriend and I came after the U.S. Open and got here at 10pm with NO line. We tried coming here before on this trip but just figured we'd give it one more try before leaving NYC and if it wasn't meant to be then so be it. Looks like the pizza Gods wanted is to try it so we got in with ease! \n\nCouple things to note:\n-no slices \n-no resos \n-no delivery\n-cash only\n-if you THINK you'll be hungry and craving for pizza, GO WAIT IN LINE IN ADVANCE. You'll get hungry by the time they seat you. \n- pizza comes out FAST! prob in 10 mins (give or take).", "author": "Kathy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-25", "description": "I've come here the past two times I've visited. A great place to stop at before or after crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. If there's a line, don't be intimidated, it goes by fast. The pizza isn't exceptional, but it's very good and worth a visit. It's build you own, which I'm a fan of.

This pizza joint was the best one we had while visiting NYC. Their ambiance was superb and we felt like we were eating at a pizza joint from the 1800's.  \n\nWe had the large pizza with pepperoni and meatballs with added ricotta cheese.  We have had both lombardis and Grimaldi and my Hubbie and I chose Grimaldis.  My Hubbie mentioned something about his pizza being sort of soggy but that still didn't tamper our views on our experience.  \n\nNothing like walking across the Brooklyn bridge to eat a wonderful lunch here at Grimaldis.  The staff here was attentive and brought us everything fairly quickly.  They have an upstairs and downstairs eating area  and a small kitchen in the bottom where you can watch them make the pizza right in front of your eyes. \n\nThanks Grimaldis for an awesome experience!

Overall, I think this place is cool if you're by the Brooklyn Bridge, in the mood for good pizza and have some time to spare. I don't mind waiting on long NYC lines for gimmicky overhyped places, it's a city thing. If you've never been here and have been contemplating it, stop overthinking and go for it.
