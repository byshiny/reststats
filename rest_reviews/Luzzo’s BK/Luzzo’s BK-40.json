Just walking by and decided to try it out. Amazing experience from beginning to start. Started with the small margarita pizza and salad to start main entree was the rigatoni with short rib and meatballs in tomato sauce. Everything is homemade by the way. Customer service was excellent. It a small place not great for large parties but very cozy. Ended the night with chocolate mousse as if I wasn't stuffed already but it was a necessity. Will definitely be coming back here in the near future to try some other menu options. No complaints over here just a quality restaurant selling quality homemade food.", "author": "King N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "There are several of things I like about this Luzzo's:\n\nThey make a decent Sazerac.\nThe atmosphere is pleasant, and even romantic.\nThe pizza is excellent (love the tartufata, the margherita, and the diavola).*\nThis location is far closer to my apartment than the one in Manhattan. \n\nWhat I really loved about this joint was the happy hour. Unfortunately, they discontinued it for now, but they've still got well above average pies with their signature thin and chewy crust. This makes me happy.\n_____________\n\n*Although, it might not even be the best pizza on this stretch of Atlantic.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-30", "description": "Went to Luzzo's based on the suggestion of our pasta maker, Un Posto Italiano.

Absolutely, great food, service, vibe\nAtmosphere (4) stool tables up front, dinner tables in back\nFood (4+) - beet sakad (4 but needs more goat cheese and pistachios), small diavola (4 - chewy crust), sm margherita pizzas (4).

I'm not so sure it should've won that Best Pizza bracket on Eater last year (as they proudly display), but it sure is excellent.\n\nTo cleanse our palates from the previous pizzas, we started with the Polpettine ($11 for 3). These were pretty delicious, and were a welcome way to start the meal over the usual salads and charcuterie. Since we already had two pies, we also figured we would switch it up a bit and tried the Orecchiette with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe ($17). This is a really delicious version of the classic pasta dish and is a great mid-course before the pizza main event.\n\nFor the pizza, we went the small Diavola (12 inch pie for $18), and it was amazing. Piping hot, it was some of the best Neapolitan style pizza you could ask for in NY. The crust was nice and chewy, with a bit of crispiness. It was fluffy and had some real substance and made you make sure you finished every last bite of the sometimes passable crust.\n\nThe place itself is very nice too, with excellent service from the waitstaff and the efficient busboys. The menu is extensive with tons of great choices - I would definitely return to try one of the great \"A Frusta\" items that I had at the Manhattan location, which are amazing.", "author": "Mike C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-30", "description": "The service is certainly warm and friendly. However, the pizza is subpar and there is definitely better to be had in the neighborhood. Had the signature pizza and the crust was watery and soggy, with sparse, unappetizing toppings.

We had aimed for Brado's but walked in to sadly see a neighborhood acquaintance drunk on the floor at 2pm. We decided to find an alternative.

Cozy and warm by the oven in the back! \n\nWasn't crazy about the pizza (sagged a bit, flavors didn't meld well) which is surprising bc I like the pizza at some of their other restaurants. In any case, lots of other great things to eat - fried artichokes, burrata, and pasta alla Norma. Service was friendly in that Italian way.

We ordered and our food (which was delicious) came quickly. At 8:10 after our plates had been cleared, the waiter asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu and we said we would like to. Two minutes later, the waiter came back and said \"I am sorry but there are a lot of people waiting for tables so we won't be able to serve you dessert tonight.\" He then placed our bill on the table and walked away. We hadn't even been there for 1 hour and we were told we couldn't have dessert. When you make a reservation at a restaurant, you should at least be given 90 minutes, if not longer, for your meal. This was unacceptable and rude and should not have happened. Even the people at the table next to us who overheard this happen were outraged.

Okay, maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's damn good.\n\nI ordered 4 pizzas to go (because I'm fat). Service was quick (15 minutes to be ready on a Saturday night).\n\nThe Luzzo's BK pizza was by far the best. Spec, truffle pate and ricotta.  Yummy.\n\nWas also a fan of the sauceless Salsiccia e Friarielli (ground sausage and broccoli rabe) and the Capricciosa (mushrooms, artichokes and olives). The Bufala was okay, just standard stuff. But I highly recommend the rest.\n\nTheir pizza menu has a pretty big selection, for both vegetarians and meat-lovers.\n\nI didn't realize until we went to pick up the pies that it was the old Sosta space. Luzzo's pizza is much better, but they've added a bar in the middle of the restaurant, which takes up a lot of the previous seating space. It just kinda juts out and is awkward to maneuver around. The place didn't seem too busy though, but I imagine if it gets more popular, it might be.\n\nAll in all, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "A dream into Italy!

It seems we started something, because about ten other groups of people walked in during our meal.\n\nThere were some issues with the restaurant's refrigerator that night, so the only items available were the pastas and pizzas, which was fine with us. We started with some cocktails and enjoyed the people watching on Atlantic while eating. I loved the Mushroom Ravioli ($18) in a light cream sauce.
