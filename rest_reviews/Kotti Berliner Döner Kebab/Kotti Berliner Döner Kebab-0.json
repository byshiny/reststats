The lunch special wasn't exactly inexpensive, as the cheapest of the specials was $10.50, but most things in DeKalb Market are on the more expensive side.\n\nI opted for the $12 salad special instead of the doner kebab this time (although the focaccia-like bread that one comes with is great). The salad came with layers of salad mix, lettuce, onions, tomato and cucumber salad, cabbage, feta cheese, a yogurt-based white sauce, a harissa-based red sauce, and lots of chicken. I was impressed by the amount of chicken that was in the bowl, and it made the price tag a little easier to swallow. The chicken was excellent, very tender and marinated in lots of spices, the vegetables were fresh, and the whole salad worked well mixed together. I liked it so much that I might consider making the salad with an add-on of bread my regular order.", "author": "Marissa L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-20", "description": "I have a couple of issues with this place. First- they were SO SLOW. The guys working at the counter were looking at me like I was crazy while waiting for them to make my Doner. \nSecond- it is way to pricy for what it is. I know de kalb market is generally pricey but Doner is a street food- $12-$14 is too expensive in my opinion. And they charge extra for sauce, seriously? Toppings I can understand but not sauce. Ridiculous! \nThe end result was good, food was fresh but definitely not worth the price or anything to write home about.", "author": "Ally M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-29", "description": "The menu is small. There are only a few options, and they are essentially all the same dish: juicy, delicious, spit-roasted chicken with all sorts of colorful and tasty toppings. \n\nNow, you can get a wrap, and it'll be easy to eat, and a good time. You can also get a salad if you really don't like being completely satisfied with a meal, but still want the nice flavors.\n\nBut the D\u00f6ner Kebab is #1 on the menu, and #1 in my heart. \n\nIt's the name of the stand for Pete's sake. It's their specialty, and wrapping up all the tasty items (just get everything) they have back there in Turkish pide...a crisp flatbread not too far off of focaccia...that's the move. It's the way this meal was meant to be eaten, and it also happens to taste the best. \n\nThis has become one of my favorite options in Dekalb Market Hall, and I'll be getting it again shortly.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-19", "description": "Love this place.

Had the chicken wrap -- it tasted fresh and had an interesting taste.  I definitely enjoyed it and see myself returning soon.

The white sauce is extremely creamy, the original flavor is not spicy at all so if you are a spicy person you may need to request special sauce.\nBesides the sauce I also love their grilled chicken! The skin is slightly burned so adding that crunchy feeling to the meal. \nCan't really find anything bad about this place!", "author": "Andrea L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-11", "description": "Probably our #1 spot in Dekalb.

It's so soft and fluffy and delicious. \n\nThese guys are in Dekalb market near the south escalator. They pile on the toppings.

At least from Greece standards. Close enough to Turkey. \n\nIt's a bit saucy. Tahini and their chili paste sauce covers everything if that's your thing. They kinda skimp on the chicken. But the bread is their saving grace. It's crisp on the outside and flaky with moist air pockets on the inside. \n\n$10.50 for the lunch special otherwise it's about $13 and change.

That was not the case with my order of 2 D\u00f6ner cones this afternoon. It was packed with very little meat, and you were left with just mostly the red cabbage and onion mix.

The biggest issue with this place is just its location - it's noisy, has lots of foot traffic, and can be awkward to wait for an order while crowds bump you around due to the close confines.  Logistic issues aside, the food is consistently very good, albeit a tad messy.  The portions are good for the price and service is always polite and friendly.

I passed by and noticed the lunch special menu. The workers were super nice and informative. I spent a little over $11 for a HUGE d\u00f6ner sandwich on the lunch special menu. It was delicious!!

It was so good! I wish that it was bigger- not that it was small- but it was just that good I could have done with more (also because of the cost). The chicken was well seasoned and tasted very fresh. I was excited to see that all of their chicken is free of hormones which was the the selling point that made me decide to give them a try.  I would caution you that this is a not a cheap lunch at all. The salad was $13 and that is the lunch special price. So if you want a tasty salad with hormone free chicken this is the way to go- but be prepared to pay for the healthiness! The people that work here are very nice too! That always helps when you're shelling out top dollar for a salad.", "author": "Kia A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-24", "description": "Happy to see in the Dekalb Market since I haven't made it to the sunset park location I bookmarked. \nDelicious wrap, lighter than I would have expected.
