He waved as I stood in line and I actually turned around to see who he was waving at (it was me)!  We chat and I feel charmed.\nNote 6:  He gives me extra food as goodwill.\n\nI will go nowhere else for my lunchtime chicken and rice.", "author": "Andrea L."}], "servesCuisine": "Food Stands", "priceRange": null, "name": "Court and Joralemon Chicken \u0026 Rice Cart", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "NW Corner Of Court Street And Joralemon", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": null, "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": ""}
