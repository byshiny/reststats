It's like a hot guy w/ no soul. You try it once and then it's not so hot looking anymore. There were some good things about Soulless Burger though:\n1. Convenient location\n2. Though it's counter service, they give you a big number to put on your table and bring you your order when it's ready \n3. Fried pickles arrived hot and with a tasty ranch like sauce\n\n-It's a bit pricy for an upgraded McDonalds.\n-Nothing, except the pickles were hot.

I nicely asked for a refund and the manager told me their meat is better than popular fast food chains and wouldn't give me a refund and laughed at us as we left. \nSo beware, don't go here if you want a good burger.

On my most recent visit. I ordered my food and verbally said my order twice. They gave me my shake a good 10 minutes before i get my food. Hmmm why would you do that. When i finally got my food and was leaving my shake melting. So im hungry. I didn't have time for tge shenanigans. Get back to the office both burger orders wrong. I look at my burger its not juicy but it costs about 8.69... hmmm right. \n\nI go back very nice employee assists me. Im appreciative. I wont be coming back though. It don't feel right with me to pay like 8 bucks for a burger that looks like it wasn't even meat but fillers. I deleted the app and unsubscribed from them.

I placed an online order for pick up, when arriving to the store I was greeted terribly, my food wasn't ready on time and to top it off I requested an extra side of sauce on my online order and basically had to fight with the cashier to get it once it wasn't in the bag. Also the manger there is a nightmare. No respect for paying customers, awful attitude and refused to let me have a cup for water. She demanded I paid for a cup. It was outrageous, this was my first and last time to ever come to smash burger.

I came in last night around 6PM, and it seemed to be pretty crowded. I get to the register to place my order and the young lady says that she's not taking any orders for the next 7 minutes because the kitchen is backed up on orders. This is just unacceptable. The kitchen staff should be fully staffed and prepared for the after work crowd. The fact that no orders were being taken completely turns other customers off. If it wasn't for the the heavy rain, I would have went somewhere else. Not to mention, the general manager who kept screaming at the kitchen staff for all the customers to hear. Totally unprofessional. \n\n Once I finally placed my order, I had to wait another 20 minutes to finally get my food. The saving grace was that my food was fresh and tasty!

Maybe it was an off day? People have those. But man, this place has a complete ice cold evening, I'm talking Starks in the NBA finals Game 7 cold (sorry knicks fans for bringing that nightmare up again).\n\nThe funny thing is, I came here with a friend of mine and talked to him about how I was here when they opened: \"oh its sooo good! their burgers are really delicious! etc etc\" I was saying on our way over there. We get there and end up attempting to order chicken sandwiches. Easier said than done I guess...\n\nMy boy ordered his first, this is important because I got mine before he did. In hindsight I should have taken a photo of our respective sandwiches. my sandwich was the most sad looking sandwich in the history of fast food. The soda machine didn't work. That is, we couldn't even get water from the machine. They barely had condiments. And to top it off, when my friend's sandwich came out, his was no less than 3x the size of mine. A huge piece of chicken cooked to perfection, not the 3 day old thing they found out back and decided to give me. What's worse is this place isn't exactly cheap. How much was may sandwich? Probably $7 or $8. Two bites later, I finish this thing, and I'm of course still hungry. I'm never going back to this place.

They started charging for modifications. They kid didn't tell me anything about up-charges to take off sauce... so i wanted a simple refund for the difference and the black manager. Rude with me didn't even defuse the issue. She made it worse. She refused to take my order, walked away from me. We started to have a yelling Match. I'm just trying to order my food. I'm still spending my money here just fix your mistake. At the end of the day my food was wrong like if they spit in it.

Staff is kind of rude at times. This particular location during school hours is really busy, but on the weekends is very quiet. So, you can go in and out and get whatever you are craving. \n\nI particularly love the strawberry shake and the burgers I always design them myself.

The food is good, but the service is terrible.  A Friday at lunchtime is not the ideal time to be short staffed or have non working registers, and I'll mention it was $3 entree day so the line was out the door. \nI can't give a better review for having to wait more than 30 minutes for my take out.

Burgers were smaller than in the picture and 50% smaller than in Smashburger in Texas for the same price, which is pretty sneaky (while, say, In-N-Out or McDonald's have consistent pricing across the states). The Smash Fries were oily, which again I didn't see in other states. They used \"plastic\" cheese from poaches, and not the freshly cut from blocks. Used cheaper white onions and not better red ones (another New York cost-cutting \"specialty\").\n\nThe interior is well kept. Decent selection of iced tea as an alternative to commonplace sugary fizzy drinks.\n\nIf they wouldn't run price promotion they'd quickly fizzle out.", "author": "Peter H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-20", "description": "The experience I had here was underwhelming. I wanted to try Smash Burger because I had heard it was really good. Honestly I think it was just okay and average. Because of this, I think it was overpriced. I ordered the spicy baja burger and the smash fries. After you order the food is brought to your table by a staff member. I had begun eating the fries that were brought to us when an employee came and informed us that she had accidentally brought us regular fries. She took them away and returned with smash fries but honestly they looked and tasted exactly the same. The regular size smash fries are smaller than a medium serving of fries at McDonalds but almost $5. They are pretty regular except for a BIT of seasoning. The burger was very small for the price as well (I ordered a single). For $4 you can add a drink and plain fries to your burger to make it a meal and this does not include smash fries (which aren't even worth it). I didn't like the iced tea and ended up getting a soda. Overall it was just okay but not worth the price.
