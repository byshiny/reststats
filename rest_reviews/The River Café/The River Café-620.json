Every customer in the restaurant was seated by the window, with about three window seats remaining. One seat remained empty for a good two hours. Food was well above average, amazing view, and our waiter was nice but the arrogance of the staff (both reception and seating) was pretty embarrassing. Would have just left if my girlfriend hasn't been looking forward to it for the last month. Not worth spending $360 to be treated like a second class citizen. Dress to impress the staff if you choose to dine here, because the food by itself wont do the price justice.", "author": "Joseph L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-17", "description": "One of the best restaurants we have eaten in. Awesome views and food. Had the Bordeaux and Pinot noir by the glass and the wines were wonderful. Had the shrimp for appetizer and lobster for the main entr\u00e9e. Out of the world! My wife had octopus for the appetizer and sea bass for the entr\u00e9e. They were fantastic too! Great pistachio and chocolate desserts as well. We had a 4-year-old with us and they accommodated her very well. They have an outdoor deck which is great for memorable pictures.", "author": "Prateek G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-09", "description": "The ambience was awesome, the service was excellent and the food was super.

Now, I've been out to restaurants for Thanksgiving before, and let's be honest, going to a restaurant for Thanksgiving makes you feel like an orphan!  \n\nNot so with The River Cafe.  \n\nJust 5 days before T-day I was able to book a 2:30 pm seating for our Thanksgiving dinner, soon to become known as, \"The best meal of my life\".\n\nThe service was beyond excellent.  Our waiter, (at first we thought he was the manager as he was dressed in a business suit) was warm and informative, and kept and eye on us from a far.  Always there if our drinks looked low or to check on our progress for the next course.  Everything was perfectly timed.  With the Thanksgiving seatings, I thought for sure we would eventually get rushed out after a few hours, but we stretched our meal out until 7 and were able to catch sunset during our meal.\n\nThe food was incredible.  I mean words simply won't do it justice.  Phrases like 'symphony of flavors' and 'absolute joy' come to mind but seem contrived compared to what the actual experience was like.   \n\nI had the crab trio appetizer, and for my main course I had whitefish with pumpkin ravioli and almonds.  My husband had some kind of ox-tail ravioli for appetizer, and for his main course sea bass with a shrimp, chorizo and vegetable stuffing.  Everything came with the traditional Thanksgiving sides.  Now my mother will tell you that I avoid yams like the plague, but the creamed yams with marshmallow sauce was practically a religious experience.  It was all I could do to refrain from licking the bowl!  And dessert was over-the-top.  We were *each* served the following: chocolate flour less cake made to look like the Brooklyn Bridge, a mini pumpkin tart with fresh made vanilla ice cream and crushed pistachios, a mini apple tart, a pumpkin gourde filled with creme brulee, and an assortment of holiday cookies.  We were so stuffed it was all we could do to sample each one before waddling off to the deck to take in the view and snap some great picks with the Statue of Liberty in the background.\n\nAfter we paid our bill and snuck away, our waiter came to find us, warmly shaking our hands and thanking us for spending Thanksgiving with them.  I mean my own family doesn't do that!", "author": "Kathleen L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-12", "description": "In the middle of a rainy, windy, chilly day in late April, my husband and I, visiting from California, were looking for a place to rest out of the wind and made a beeline for a bench in the lovely garden outside of the River Cafe. A woman who was organizing plants for the cafe took pity on us and invited us inside, even though at that point the restaurant had not yet reopened for lunch service. She seated us at a table in the greenhouse with a stunning view of the Lower Manhattan skyline and the Brooklyn Bridge, served us coffee and cookies, and then went about her work as we thawed out. What a beautiful restaurant, and the cookies and coffee were delicious! Thank you, Maureen--we'll never forget your kindness.", "author": "Karen M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-27", "description": "The 2-stars are for the view \u0026 that's being generous.

The 6-course tasting menu was perfect. All four of us agreed that this was by far the best tasting menu we ever had. My favorite course was the branzino. It was simply exquisite. Though the perfectly seasoned steak and scallops were close runner-ups. The South African crayfish was quite special and rich. Although I can't say the dessert was the best I ever had, I did enjoy the special ice cream and chocolate cake. For some reason there is discrimination between genders for desserts. The boys were served with a lemon cheesecake and sorbet. The girls received the chocolate cake with an adorable chocolate bridge and ice cream. \n\nI can go on an on about the wonderful ambience and scene. Bottom Line: Make a reservation and request a window seat. Totally worth it. If this place can't manage to induce romance in your relationship, then I'm afraid it's time to fold.", "author": "Amy R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-10", "description": "I can't really add anything that others haven't said.  This place is special.  BF took me there for our anniversary.  We had to take an early reservation b/c later times were booked.  Come a few mins early to have a cocktail on the deck.  \nIf you're going in the summer be sure to either ask for a seat NOT near the window OR go after the sun is behind the buildings.  We had amazing views - our table was right against the windows.  Unfortunately, it was 90 degrees outside and it felt that hot inside... and we were literally being baked in our seats.  We asked the waiters if there was a way to lower the blinds and they said they were as low as they'd go.  Bring sunglasses.\n\nFood was delicious.  Service was attentive.

Walking down Old Fulton street, reaching the ridiculous line at Grimaldi's (mind you, there is nothing wrong with waiting for 1.5 hrs for their pizza), then for a change, PASSING the line at Grimaldi's, because we're heading to the River Cafe. \nIs it all that it's cracked up to be? Yup, I think so. \n\nHad Dad take the family here for Mom's 50th birthday. The weather was great, our table perfect by the window, piano in the background - the mood for a pleasant afternoon already set. Score (!) as it is not easy to please critical Mom.  \n\nNone of us ordered the same which meant I tried 4 different appetizers and 4 entrees - as good as family dining gets. Before even that, as a pre-appetizer they brought us really really good carrot bread  in addition to our fresh rolls. Then surprise. The server places in front of each of us a plate with an egg on it, cracked on top, then pours milk into it. Quizzical subtle glances among us - no idea what it is. My brother takes one for the team and asks how to eat it. Ha, turns out you just spoon it out. It was some sort of granola but not your usual boring breakfast granola - much better. But of course granola is served in an egg! Duh. \n\nAs for appetizers. I had the seafood trio (shrimp-fabulous-tempura, tuna/avocado delicacy, dumpling), my bro - oysters (this was maybe the one thing I did not enjoy but that probably mostly due to me not being an oysters person), mom - salmon, dad - trout. Excellent.  Had to wait quite a while for our entrees which of course just intensified the anticipation and we were not disappointed. I could not be happier with my choice - branzino with tiny zucchini and ham cubes. Oh My Goodness. Also tried the salmon with mushroom sauce and the duck, which was serviced with sausages and an omelette over a phyllo pastry. Oh My. Again. I think this is what those cooking competition judges must feel like. When the contestants are all excellent. I can be a quick eater, but this time, I just wanted to take my time with each and every single bite to make the most of the taste.\n\nThoroughly enjoyable, definitely worth the price for the right occasion. Would love to go back again of course and hopefully it'll be for dinner.
