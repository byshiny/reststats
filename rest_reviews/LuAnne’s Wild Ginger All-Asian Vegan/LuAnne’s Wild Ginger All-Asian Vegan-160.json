My non-Vegan family and friends when I suggest to come here have an aversion simply because there is no \"meat\" on the menu. I eat and love meat too but if its protein and a yummy full feeling you want, then come here!! There's nothing better than a guiltless meal that will leave you feeling oh so nice. This time around I told the waitress I was pregnant and she immediately pointed to an entree (forgot name...something like bimbam) and oh my goodness was it goood. Being pregnant, it can be very difficult to find something I can look at to eat. But apparently the baby loved it too!

The oyster mushrooms were our favorite, with the tofu skins coming in second\n\nFor entrees, we ordered the black pepper seitan, the Korean bim-im-bop which came with a side of pumpkin soup and the eggplant. The Korean bim-im-bop was delicious. It came with a side of sesame and hot sauce. The portion was also huge. The black pepper seitan was the best seitan I've ever had. It came with a side of Chinese broccoli.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the pumpkin cheesecake and the apple crumble which is shipped in from a vegan bakery. The cheesecake was topped with walnuts and won hands down.\n\nThe interior is cozy and intimate. It was decently packed and would make a good date spot.", "author": "Caitlin M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-28", "description": "This is my boyfriend's and I go-to restaurant and he's not even vegan!

Asian and vegan is usually a great place to eat at and trouble free for someone who is gluten intolerant. Two servers hadn't a clue about what gluten free is. There was no mention of it on the menu, and they kept talking about soy products not being okay. When even the most uneducated person knows it has nothing to do with soy. Soy sauce yes (because there is WHEAT IN SOY  SAUCE), but soy products, not soy much ;-) they were clueless and I find this rather irritating. I wish they'd pay more attention. But the food we ordered was tasty. We had the jap chae which was delish. And the big miso soup. Not sure if I'll be going back.", "author": "Jennifer K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-07", "description": "A friend suggested this place for lunch the other day, as we typically stick pretty close to Montague St. establishments and felt like something different.  The decor is very cool - a bit dark and hip with whimsical touches, like the curtains you walk through on the way in.\n\nI had the tofu and vegetables with brown rice, and it was really good.  Lots of vegetables, and not just your standards - I was happy to find delicious lotus root, yum.  The lunch special comes with miso soup, which is okay.  My dining partner had the curry stew, which smelled great.\n\nA lot of things on the menu looked awesome, and I can't wait to come back the next time I need to take a long, peaceful lunch hour.", "author": "Hope M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-06", "description": "I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, but this is one of my favorite places to eat. There is never a wait, and the food is always really solid. I tend to bring people here who don't normally eat vegetarian food and they always find themselves pleasantly surprised. Quiet and pleasant atmosphere, although you could probably bring a big group here if you reserved in advance, and would have no problem. I highly recommend the spring rolls, scallion pancakes, and bbq seitan skewers.

I would gladly eat almost anything on this menu. My favorites are the cheesy wantons, the pad see elw, the avocado smoothie, the peanut butter bomb.

I mean even if i were not a vegan which im not, id go eat here the food is so awesome.

Alas, unlike The Greens, it's always one of the most expensive. That said, man, the food is so fresh and so good.  My first recommend: the Tofu Skin Wraps appetizer.  Like most of the other items (I've had) it's simple but still kinda complex in ingredients and looks, respectively.  The Curry Momosas are also on point, esp. with the Mint-Chutney dip.  \n\nAs far as the entrees, I've had the Orange Seitan, which is very tasty and filling, as well as the Pad Thai which was pretty good.  The Basil Soy Protein is really good, but I'm impartial to almost anything cooked well in basil.  I would rate this spot higher, despite the price, but both the servers and cashier are kinda lame, and I'm big on service.  It's not so bad though that I'd never go back, so check it out when you can.", "author": "Curtis J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-21", "description": "Fresh, delicious, flavorful.

The coconut cream on the apple pie was disgusting. Tasted like pure coconut oil. The spring rolls were decent but texture was soft and not crispy. The king oyster mushrooms had a nice flavor but the mushroom was tough and chewy. Made it hard to eat so I threw them out.
