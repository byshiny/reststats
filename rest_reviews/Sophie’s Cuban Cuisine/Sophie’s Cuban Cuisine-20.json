They also have Cuban classics like ropa vieja here which I hear is very good.\nOverall, this is some good comfort food done in a Hispano-Cuban style-I probably order from here once a month and love it!", "author": "Allana D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-24", "description": "Came here for lunch break from jury duty and I found myself on a massive line. It's one of those places where all the food were pre-made and you just order what you like. They had three type of rice yellow rice, white rice or moro (rice with black beans). Then you pick your choice of meat include pernil, ropa vieja, oxtail, chicken, or fish. Most of the meals contain two sides with choices of steam veggies, maduros, plaintains, avocado, yucca or salad. I chose moro, pernil with sides of maduros and avocado. It was delicious and full of flavor and a really large portion. I end up eating it for two more meals and it taste even better the day after surprisingly. I was too full for dessert but I was always check out what they have, which includes tres leches cake, rice pudding, and guava cheese empanada.", "author": "Ann S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-10", "description": "Great food here, but some food lacks flavor.

The lunch specials are affordable and potions are huge! Cuban pork is definitely my go to here. It's cooked perfectly and flavor is on point with the balanced meat and fat ratio. Plantains and black beans with avocado are the perfect sides to go along as well.

It was indeed a pleasant surprise to have so many options for this non pork, beef eater. The first visit I had the turkey, rice, and beans. I tried my luck at their flan, as was sold. However, I only liked it because it was firm - I soon learned all flan is not created equal. \n\nDuring my most recent visit, I enjoyed the shrimp and was once again thoroughly satisfied. \n\nSophie's is definitely a winner.", "author": "Jeanene B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-31", "description": "Sophie's Cuban Cuisine is known to me for their restaurants in Manhattan.

Might as well give me pork right. \n\nVery ridiculous place I would say.\nWill never go there again.", "author": "Am T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-18", "description": "Decided to try here as it is a 30 second walk from my office. I used their online ordering system to place an order for steak with onions and 2 complementary sides of yellow rice and fries. I was told to pick up after 20 minutes, but the food was already ready for me when I arrived 15 minutes after ordering. Yay for fast service!\n\nI worried that they had forgotten to include sauces for my steak and fries, but when I opened the bag I saw that they had given me generous amounts of ketchup and their special, slightly spicy green sauce. \n\nThe food wasn't anything particularly special. I did like how thin and non-chewy the steak was, and I also did appreciate the onion's thickness, but otherwise, the dish was just as you would expect a dish of steak + onions + yellow rice + fries to be. Not anything less, and not anything more. The portions are generous though, so even though you are paying $10 for a basic meal you can cook at home for less, you'll at least feel satisfied and full. I will be back though, to try their famous pernil dish:)", "author": "Gahee L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-20", "description": "Great Cuban Sandwich! 3 stars.

I had a turkey sandwich and one chicken and beef empanadas. The turkey sandwich is pretty good. Having empanadas for the first time I definitely liked the chicken empanada. I wasn't a fan of the beef because they put green olives in it.\n\nI also loved the green sauce that they give you. It's spicy and sweet, awesome for the sandwich or the empanadas.", "author": "Jacky C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-25", "description": "I feel mixed about my experiences at Sophie's Cuban.\n\nFive stars: really fast delivery, inexpensive, massive portions, the green sauce served on the side is ADDICTIVE, the maduros (sweet plantains) were excellent, and the ropa vieja entree was incredibly flavorful.\n\nHowever, the other entrees I have tried in the past were not nearly as good. The pernil was watery and bland. It doesn't  come with any crispy skin, it's just the pulled meat. Not a huge fan. I've also had the shrimp in garlic sauce. The sauce is good but the shrimp were tiny, overcooked, and chewy. The side salad was lacking too, and was a bowl of watery lettuce. \n\nDon't get me wrong - for some inexpensive, quick Cuban food and piled plates of rice and beans...this place hits the spot.

I asked for the empanadas combo he told me they don't have that which he was lying. I felt uncomfortable! With his attudite that my coworker had to step in and finish the orders.

Pairs perfectly with their amarillo rice. Pollo al horno is cheeto coloured and suspect. I'm sure it's delicious and I'm just wary of frankenfood but it's not like this place serves free range non gmo chicken- right? \n\nSalt fish and cassava are pretty good. Excellent moro de guandules; moist and delicious on its own. \n\nOxtail isn't caramelized brown the way Trinis and Jamaicans do, but Hispanics add olives for a kick  in the gravy. They don't trim the extra fat either but it's pretty addictive even though it's the devil.\n\nSay no to their flan and the rest of desserts. Half arsed sugar traps. \n\nThey serve sour sop! Yum!
