Yes folks, we take our job as pizza connoisseurs very seriously. We had left Lombardi's quite satisfied the night before. That was until we sat down and started eating here (after a 60+ minute wait, of course.) The wait is a pain, but I rate this place higher. We ordered the same pizza: with sausage, onions, and mushrooms. The crust was thinner (point to L as I prefer a slightly thicker crust), but the sausage here was much tastier. And at $26 for a large, it was $6 less than the medium we ordered at L. Grimaldi's is the clear winner.", "author": "Eme L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-13", "description": "I feel like I shouldn't even write a review because there are too many already, but whatever, best pizza in New York.

I bet I've had more Grimaldi's than the people who work there. I crave the stuff, but SOMETIMES THEY USE CANNED INGREDIENTS AND THE PIZZA TASTES LIKE POOEY. \n\nThat said, their pizza isn't exactly New York pizza to me. It's more Italian. It's quite fancy and beautiful to look at. The cheese and sauce are evenly distributed, and not lain on top of one another like a street slice. \n\nIf you go there, go in the middle of the day (weekday) when it's bad weather outside. there's almost never a line when that's the case, and you'll get special attention from the very lovely waitstaff. I've accused katz' of not being authentic, but Grimaldi's DEFINITELY is. They live in a time warp. They almost have no idea how booming their business is. It's like they were just pumped the president showed up to feed his kids pizza so they could get a picture of him. \n\nEating there makes the pizza better. Take out isn't so great. It's just not the same as sitting at those picnic tables and sharing a carafe of wine with a loved one.

The pizza was bland, hardly any sauce.  It didn't taste fresh. The crust lacked flavor. It was the texture of stale bread.

So great that I even got their Tshirt :)\n\nLuckily there was no line when we went (that was a Friday evening) and we were able to get started right away.

The types of cheese and sauce they use are special and different that you just want to keep on eating this pizza. \n\nThere's no set pizza here. You make your own by adding different toppings, and everything including the dough is made it just for you and your friends. \n\nWhen the pizza comes out of the oven and gets stationed in front, you can't stop by drool over the pizza, because it's hot, fresh, and delicious! =D \n\nIf you are going to Brooklyn, make a stop there and try the pizza!", "author": "Janice K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-01", "description": "We made the trip across the Brooklyn bridge, waited in the long line, and waited forever for our pies to show up. Once they did, we soon discovered that this place lives mostly off of the hype surrounding it.  Don't get me wrong, the pizzas are better than Dominos, but they are no better than the random pizza place we found wandering around town late one night at a place with absolutely no wait.

The crazy long lines are off-putting however, and somewhat cuts into the romantic allure of this place. We called in and ordered and pizza, picked it up, and ate it across the bridge in NYC. If the streets weren't covered in snow, we would have eaten it on the bridge. I recommend doing the take-out route (took us 10 minutes) if you have little patience for waiting in line. We ordered a half margherita and half pepperoni pizza. We tried Saluggi's, Rosarios, and Mezzaluna in NYC during the same week and I thought Grimaldi's was the quintessential NYC pizza.  Let's not even talk about Arinell's here in SF. The mozzarella is delicious as is the tomato sauce. The thin crust was perfect and had a smoky taste from the coal-oven.", "author": "Annie Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-19", "description": "I have good memories from this Restaurant....

We may not have much up there, but what we do have is a huge ethnic population. That huge ethnic population can make food that puts most restaurants I've been to in their place (note, most). This is especially evident when I went to what it supposed to not only be the best pizza in New York, but in the country. \n\nThe pizza is good, bordering on great, but I went in with the expectation to be floored, and I most certainly was not. It was fairly standard brick oven pizza with a simple sauce and mozzarella cheese. Nothing to write home about, but apparently something to write here about. Overall, I would go back to NEPA and eat in Old Forge or, my personal favorite and what is quite possibly the greatest concoction of cheese, dough and sauce on the planet, Jerry's Pizza.\n\nI didn't have any trouble with a wait. We went on a weekday, stopped in at a bar around the corner, ordered a Brooklyn Brown, called Grimaldis, picked it up in 20 minutes and ate our pizza in Brooklyn Bridge Park, which may be the reason I gave it so many stars.

The pizza was not only not good, it was bad. I don't mind the wait and rude waiters if the pizza is going to be a mind blowing experience, but it was terrible.

We were lucky and got seated within 15 of arriving, but when we left there was a line down to the end of the block (outside, in the cold - this just seems like madness to me).\n\nThe coal-burning wood-fired oven is the real deal and the pizza is crispy, thin, and made with proper fresh mozzarella.

Long story short we decided to get a pie, ended up waiting an hour for an undercooked pie with subpar sausage. I mean really...as soon as I took a bite I could taste that it wasn't cooked properly, and a cross section of the extremely thin pie showed striations reminiscent of the earth's layers - cooked, sorta cooked, and kinda raw. Completely overhyped, also the $5 atm fee next door to this cash only restaurant is downright usurious.

But the line isn't. If you're not a tourist, want pizza for dinner and don't want to wait on line, find another pizza place. There's a new one in town anyway. It's down the street from Peter Luger's called Patricia's at 35 Broadway. It's not Grimaldi's, but it's goood.\n\nHonestly, Grimaldi's is good. I mean, better than 90% of the pizza joints in NYC.
