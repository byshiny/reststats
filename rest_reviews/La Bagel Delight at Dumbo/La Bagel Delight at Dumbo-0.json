The bacon egg and cheese I got was decent but light on egg and cheese.\n\nThe wait to order was 10 min, and about 5-10 min for the bagel to be ready as well. The price isn't bad and they have some cheap chips and drinks you can snack on while waiting.", "author": "Jennifer D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-25", "description": "Stopped by this place when I was in the area for a quick bite. The bagels are pretty delicious and large for the price. I got a whole wheat everything bagel toasted with cream cheese for $2.75 and it really filled me up. There are no places to sit in the cafe which is unfortunate, but luckily there are picnic tables a little down the road that you can eat at.\n\nIt seems like they have some pretty good breakfast specials during the weekdays until 1 pm so I'll definitely stop by again for breakfast when I'm in the area.", "author": "Giselle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-04-27", "description": "The bagel was okay, the turkey bacon might have been undercooked. They're friendly to locals but not friendly to tourists. They have lots of options for lunch but not many for breakfast. You're not able to make your own coffee, they ask you how you want it. There was no greeting. I mean they weren't unfriendly but when a place has friendly staff it really makes a difference for their customers.", "author": "Kalyn T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-25", "description": "One of the best places to have a bagel in Brooklyn. Great selection, many breakfast and lunch options available. I've tried couple of their sandwiches and everything is just good quality and great tasting. Had their turkey sandwich with grilled onions and cheese and also their chicken fantastic which has the chicken, cheese and lettuce. Both were good. There was along line to order at the counter and had to wait about 10 mins until it was ready.

I worked in the area and was a regular. They are very fast, kind, and on point. Leaving La Bagel for the last time was the saddest part about leaving my job in the area (honestly). Great prices / best bagels / best staff / asst cream cheeses / yum sandwiches / tasty treats.

They taste fresh, add a generous amount of cream cheese, and there's a variety of spreads. \n\nHowever, my qualms are with the consistent disappointing drinks. Twice, I've ordered their iced black tea, because I'm not a coffee drinker, but I need the caffeine, and both times the iced tea tasted so old and bitter. I drink my black tea without any sugar, so I know that it is strong and has a kick to it, but what they gave me both times was just old and gross. The tea was murky. \n\nWhen I went today to get it, I decided to ask for a sample before I bought it to see if it's just an abandoned drink that no one bothers to check on, or if it was just a two time occurrence. The iced tea was okay, not very old tasting, but what I discovered later was the super old and mushy lemon slices they added to it. I asked for extra lemon and when I went to squeeze them, they were so mushy that they turned into a yellowy oatmeal mush. Not good. A waste of almost $4, but a cumulative waste of $12.", "author": "Majlinda B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-28", "description": "I've been here a dozen times for some morning grub and have never left disappointed. Fresh, chewy and flavorful, bagels, good cream cheese distribution and quantity, hot unburned coffee. Orders with eggs in them take a little longer, buts that's only because they cook them fresh as you order.\n\nPricing is pretty good, not bargain-basement values, but quite excellent for this neighborhood. $3 for two eggs on a bagel, $1.25 for a plain bagel. $3.25 for egg cheese on bagel plus coffee.\n\nThe only downside I see it that it gets a little crowded and confusing with their unorganized order system. If you are heading in there, the line on the right by the display case is usually for people who have not ordered. The people hanging out on the left and in back have placed their order and are waiting. Remember what you ordered because there is no order number or name system, they will just call out your food items when ready.", "author": "Matt C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-12-19", "description": "Im really sorry, but I have to change my review. I've gone here twice now both times my order has been wrong. One time so wrong that I had allergic reaction and got extremely ill. Their busy, their fast, but they are not tentative at all. First time, I ordered a scallion tofu cream cream cheese sandwich. I was given a Veggie tofu cream cheese, that's fine. But this time..I ordered a scallion tofu cream cheese w/ tomato slices and noticed far too late that it was indeed real cream cheese not tofu. I got extremely EXTREMELY ill. If you have an allergy, are vegan, or particular I wouldn't recommend it. Super bummer because you do make good stuff.
