A very nice beer list indeed, and nice and quiet on Sunday afternoon. We weren't very, so the poor waitress had to made do with our 2 rounds of drinks.\n\nThe inside is on the darker side, perfect if you want to hide away from the world for a couple of hours, but not gloomy or anything. There are some sports on the TV but not so loud that you can't tune it out. Quality neighborhood pub.", "author": "Yan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-20", "description": "This is my go to neighborhood pub. Fantastic beer selection. They also rotate selections which is nice. The bartender Pete is awesome, and knows the beer selections well. He can give you a recommendation based on your preferences. In addition, they have an excellent selection of whiskey. The food is a must try also. The nacho plate is great!! So is the chicken burrito. However my favourite thing on the menu is the western  chicken sandwich. It's so good. Plus they give you the option of sweet potato fries which is really nice. My only complaint is that they are not open later. That way I could visit even more. Overall a must try.", "author": "Joseph L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-21", "description": "I live near by and am a fan of this place, got to know Lee who is very cool, and the GM I think who is super nice. Loads of craft beers that seem to circulate regularly, and the bartenders seem to know a lot about them to help you pick the best one for your tastes. Also had a Mac and cheese which I totally dug, but it's hard to screw up a Mac and cheese. The crowd is a little hipstery and stuck up, but that comes with the whole craft beer territory. Strongly recommend stopping in if your over in Brooklyn heights.

Great beers on tap. ( no bud here!)  \n\nConsistently solid food \u0026 high quality specials.

As one of my friends had eaten before at Henry's so we all decided to check this place out. \n\nIt was a sunday evening and this place was packed though we were easily able to get  table us(we were 6 of us). This place has an amazing selection when it comes to beer. Though I didn't order any drinks but my friends loved thier drinks.\n\nSo for food I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and my friends ordered the turkey club, stuffed potato skins, Grilled veggie burrito and grilled buffalo chicken sandwich. My pulled pork sandwich was really flavorfull and tasty and even potato skins were nice. Everybody like the food except the turkey sandwich which was dry and bland. The service here was really nice considering they were busy.

We ordered two burgers (which were good) and two draft beers. Upon ordering the beer, and seeing no signs anywhere about what was the happy hour deal, we asked the bartender whose reply was an ambiguous and vague, \"well... happy hour prices depend on the day, and [blah, blah, blah...]\" What kind of answer is that? All happy hour deals are clear anywhere else (e.g.: 1/2 price off on beer, or $4 beer and wine, etc.) Now I regret that my friend and I didn't see this red flag going up; we should've canceled the ordered immediately and gone somewhere else.\n\nUpon getting the check, we were charged $32 for four beers ($8 per glass) and the pathetic \"happy hour\" was a $5 discount on the beer ($1.25 per glass.) We complained to the bartender who told us that, apparently, the owner is the one who decides what \"happy hour\" means every day (based on... what?) and that, indeed, people have complained to him/her about this.\n\nEach restaurant owner or manager is free to make the call on what type of happy hour they want to offer, good or bad. BUT it should always be visible upon a client's arrival and clearly defined by the staff when asked about; none of this nonsense about \"well... let me call the owner and ask what the happy hour will be today for you.\"\n\nIn my opinion, and based on my regrettable experience at the Henry St. Ale House, the way in which they conduct their \"happy hour\" is a scam.\nNEVER AGAIN.", "author": "Sergio Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-18", "description": "I just feel so comfortable here! Maybe because it's the first place I ate at when I moved to Brooklyn Heights. But I've never been disappointed by Henry st ale house! The portions are large and the prices are fair. The food is tasty and comforting! There's a good selection of beers. And the crowd that comes here isn't so hip that you'll feel out of place.

They have a decent beer selection but on a Friday night only one bartender and surprisingly close at 2am (hey! I live in NYC for a reason-that is way too early to end a night) \n\nThe bar is nearly the length of the entire place and there are seats by the window, alongside the bar and booths in the back.

It was a monday night and the place was 15% capacity at best. I don't know how this place stays in business when you can't serve a group of people that come in looking for a cold drink.

The waiter was clearly agitated because we were standing instead of sitting at the tables in a very uncomfortable corner of the establishment.  He said \"it's not the way things are done here\". So we found a friendly, more hospitable place that allowed a group of friends to stand around and talk amongst themselves.  We spent about $500 there and our waitress made over $100 in tips.

I came in with a friend for their chicken pot pie for a cold January night. It did not disappoint. They put the phyllo dough on top of a bowl of chicken pot pie filling goodness and when you break up the phyllo and miss the two it's like heaven.
