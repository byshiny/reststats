It's crazy vibe great food and drinks never dissapoint. Best of all look up at all the amazing lighting fixtures. Walk down to the party rooms they are amazing. I hope the owners are related to the artist because these are massive works of outrageous art, like you'd see in the grand casinos.", "author": "Gina S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-12", "description": "Came here today with my team, we were a group of nine, so was pleased when it wasn't busy. Relatively quick with menus and drinks but then it went down hill. Took well over an hour for our entr\u00e9es to arrive. Like, literally, it wasn't busy so we were at a complete loss as to what the hold up could be. Food was fine once it came, nothing amazing but nothing awful. Would have been fine if not for the wait.

Food is pretty good. Service both times was HORRIBLE. Sat at the bar by myself on both occasions and was practically ignored on both occasions. When I sat down there were two bar tenders having a full blown conversation. When they were done one walked off and the other started another convo with a third bar tender who was making a drink. I had to flail my arms to get a menu! Then they had a nerve to have an attitude while taking my order. All of this took place on the second visit. The first visit service was just really really slow for no obvious reason.", "author": "Carla Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-30", "description": "Kitschy chain Mexican restaurant with a great tequila selection. If you're looking for authentic, go elsewhere. Very much so a TexMex place.\nThe place is huge and great for large groups. and there are TVs EVERYWHERE", "author": "Margaret A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-01", "description": "Would give 3 stars for the food and drinks but EVERYTIME I go there even if they're not that busy, they fuck up my order!!! I got seltzer instead of ginger ale.. I ordered 3 different tacos and I got 2.. Asked for extra sour cream, didn't get any!!! I'm not coming back cause this is the 2nd or 3rd time I've had my orders messed up!!! I could understand if they were crazy busy but they weren't !

It is made fresh at the table and is really a meal by itself. I have had the tacos and the chimichanga so far, and they are both excellent, though the chimichanga could have used more salsa verde. If you are going with a friend, get a pitcher of margaritas (it is the best value). Their mango margaritas are excellent, especially in this summer heat!", "author": "Greg B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-10", "description": "Food was great but service was poor.

This place is awesome! The margaritas are so freaking good. Our waitress was so funny and charismatic. We had the nachos, and man... Those were the best damn nachos I have ever had.
