I'm sorry to say that this pizza legend didn't live up to my expectations.\nAfter living in NY for nearly a decade and enjoying some of this city's best pizza, I can't say that this joint belongs in the top 10 -- or even the top 20.\n\nShowing up ~30 minutes before opening time is key.  I was nearly the first one there.  No wait at all when the doors opened.\n\nBut sadly, the pie left plenty to be desired.  Although the dough is pretty tasty, the pie is cooked unevenly (yes, seemingly without love!), so parts are overly burnt, and others are white and doughy.  Boo!\n\nWe got half pepperoni, half plain.  In retrospect, would have gotten all plain or at least another topping.  The pepperoni was very poor quality.  Seriously, if you want good pepperoni, go to Angelo's in midtown.  Their pepperoni is the tastiest and leanest and spiciest I've had.  Grimaldi's pepperoni tasted like it came from a supermarket package.\n\nThe sauce was alright.  The cheese was abundant, but not particularly good. \n\nAll in all, a real disappointment.  But the saving grace was the Brooklyn Bridge when we had washed our hands of the pie!", "author": "Erica K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-15", "description": "Honestly, the pizza did not taste like anything.

This didn't disappoint. The line seemed long but it moved fast enough. The crust has a really good flavor and the ingredients tasted very fresh. You won't be disappointed with this choice. Note that you don't come here for service. The servers did everything we asked but they were so busy running around that they didnt stop to ask how you were doing or refill your water unless you asked.

Their pizza is one of the best I have tried. I really love the thin crust. The place is pretty small, so the space is tight.

I guess I was lucky as there was no line and we were not rushed to leave at all. Group of 4 had two large pizzas, beer, wine, cappuccino, \u0026 canoli and were there for over an hour.

It has almost become a cliche tourist destination.  Even without the line, I have found many better pizza places in the city.  I recommend visiting once during the non-tourist seasons to see what the hype is about.  You get a good thin crust pizza but the cramped quarters and rude service are not worth the trek.  However, River Cafe and Brooklyn Ice Cream are definitely worth the trip.", "author": "Madhav T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-22", "description": "I love Grimaldi's one of the best tasting pizza places in NYC.  It's thin crust pizza with perfect sauce with lots of cheese and lots of choices.  Clean, lively restaurant, nearby to Jacques Torres and the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory with great views of the bridge.  Be prepared to wait, and sometimes outside in the cold!  Worth it though!!!", "author": "Sandra G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-02", "description": "As we got off High St. off the subway (we opted not to walk on the brooklyn bridge for time and energy sake), it was my first taste of Brooklyn and from afar, I saw a long line facing the East River, it was the line of hungry people waiting for the grimaldi's pizza! Initially hesitant, we decided to be part of the excitement of trying NYC pizza amongst other tourists (as well as locals). The wait = 1 hour. The result = heavenly pizza like I\"ve never had before. Using a coal brick oven, the crust is crispy and the fresh mozarella cheese and basil along with our choice of sweet peppers, mushrooms and sausage was just simple yet simply delicious. It was worth the wait and a must-taste if you're visiting NYC and have the patience. Now, that I'm back home, I contemplate replicating it with trader joe's pizza dough and my conventional oven....yeah right!", "author": "Jenny L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-30", "description": "Tried Grimaldi's during the Slice of Brooklyn Pizza Tour.  We ordered a Margherita pizza and it came out in less than 10 minutes.  (Apparently the pizzas cook here less than 3 minutes and come out perfectly).  The pizza was delicious and flavorful.

While the pizza is priced well, the overall atmosphere has some distinct annoyances. #1 They could stand to figure out a beer/wine license. Pizza goes well with beer. #2 While they wait for their liquor license, they could stand at least stand to figure out a soda fountain. I don't like to be handed a plastic bottle of anything in a restaurant, even a very casual one. #3 The service -- maybe it's charming to some people, but I found it annoying. #4 The \"door policy.\" How about a reservation policy? Or at least being able to put your name in instead of waiting forever in a line. #5 Cash only -- as always, I find cash only an unnecessary inconvenience.  All that said, I'd go back (probably better for lunch), because the pizza is good and the location is great, right by the water, so it's a nice place to eat before walking around by the water.", "author": "David S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-19", "description": "I haven't had better, so five stars it is.

Line out the door and a crazy wait.  A little out of the way, but a great walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.  Eat your pizza then have ice cream under the bridge.  Don't go hungry.  In fact, bring a snack for the wait, but the pizza was delish.  Plus, they give them to go on a cardboard circle in a flat bag with a little pizza-saver in the middle.  Neat!
