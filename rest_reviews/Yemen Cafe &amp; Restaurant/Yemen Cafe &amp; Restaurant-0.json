What a beautiful moment. The tables adorned with giant dates and soup and salad with delicious clay pot bread. \n\nTried two chicken dishes. The Chicken Haneeth and the Curry. Personally I felt the curry imparted more flavor. I saw tables with beautiful platters of lamb. I would definitely try those next time. The soup was my favorite. Filled with earthy spices.

My friend from Brooklyn convinced us to give this place a try. We were down because we never had Yemeni food before and the place was packed. We figured it had to be good.\n\nOur experience here was doomed from the start. It was the month of Ramadan and we were nearing the time you break fast and there were no seats in sight.\n\nWhen we finally got seated and we're served our food, we were mildly disappointed. Usually after fasting all day, anything edible tastes good, but I just couldn't enjoy my meal here.\n\nI didn't enjoy the soup, the bread with dipping sauce, or the lamb chops. I didn't even know lamb chops could taste bad. My other friends enjoyed it a lot and claimed Its because i didn't order the lamb hanif, which happens to be their most popular item. \n\nMaybe I'll go back in the future for the lamb hanif but as of now, this place gets a no from me.", "author": "Tasnim C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-23", "description": "Amazing food! This was an unexpected stop after a group of us went to the transit museum nearby. We walked past it while going to another restaurant, but our first choice was closing for an hour between brunch and dinner so we decided to come here since we've never had Yemeni food before. \n\nThe street where Yemen Cafe and Restaurant is located has several other Middle Eastern establishments which is always good to see. When you have a cluster of restaurants and shops, that must mean there is a population that lives nearby and therefore, it should be authentic. \n\nWe walked in and the decor is very simple which is fine with me since as long as it is clean, I don't care much for decor. The staff was friendly and put two tables together for us. \n\nLet me just start with the fact that the free tea is AMAZING. It's self serve so you just pour it yourself into a styrofoam cup and you can put in dehydrated milk. I think I drank 5 cups throughout the meal. \n\nI got the Chicken Agda (Loubia) and it was tasty and the chicken was falling off the bone. It was not dry at all. The rice was perfectly cooked. The portions were so large that I ended up taking about 1/3 of it home. \n\nI also tried the Fahsah and it was delicious and came out bubbling in a hot stone bowl. \n\nThe price was really good and I would definitely come back again", "author": "Gaoxiang C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-22", "description": "Bread upon bread upon bread. \nThe naan like bread was continuously replenished at no extra charge. It was very tasty. \nYou also get complimentary green spicy sauce and a lamb soup and a salad. \n\nFyi the (marag) soup looks vegetarian but it's not. The lamb soup was very flavorful and tasty. My friend who hates lamb actually loved this soup and ended up eating the whole thing before she realized it was lamb. \n\nI also really liked the complimentary tea. It tasted like chai but was somewhat different. Some sweet and sour notes. \n\nI got the Fahsah, which was about $13.95. This was really good and my favorite from the stuff I  tried from friends. This dish includes shredded lamb and it is served bubbling hot in a clay bowl. The meat was very soft and not too overwhelming. \nThey also gave us some cold spicy sauce that went well with this dish. \n\nThe service was so good. Everyone was very nice and courteous. They accommodated our large group. \n\nThe inside is nothing fancy but it's one of those gems that you should try out because the food is worth it.", "author": "Suzanna H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-30", "description": "I LOVE THIS PLACE! For anyone who loves middle eastern food, THIS IS A MUST. The soup they start you out with has to be one of the best soups I've ever tasted in my life. It's flavor is off the charts. The salad they provide is average, nothing special. However, their entrees are amazing. I ordered the Lamb Haneez and I could not put my fork down. It was incredibly delicious. The meat was so tender and flavorful, I just kept wanting more. They also provide free tea, which is also quite good. They are a bit pricey though.

I was a bit nervous coming to this restaurant because I had never tried Yemeni food before and I wasn't sure if this place would give me a great introduction.. thankfully I learned my lesson: never judge a book by its cover. Although this place isn't the fanciest, the food sure makes up for it. \n\nBefore even ordering, you are given a good portioned side salad and soup. The soup was absolutely delicious, I'm not too sure what was in it but it was very good. The salad was good too but I'm not really a salad type of gal. As for the entree, I ordered the chicken haneeth but please order the lamb! I had a taste of my friend's lamb haneeth and fell in love. It was juicy, tender and did not have that gamey smell everyone is scared of. My chicken haneeth was good too, but the lamb definitely stole the show. The meats were on the side to a bed of rice with some sort of vegetable stew on top. \n\nSuper good! Yemeni food is very comforting and hearty, perfect for a cold day. I also highly recommend the tea! I normally don't like lamb or tea but this place made me question who I was because I loved both.

Every time I've been there, there has been a small wait. The staff is always so inviting, courteous and prompt.\n\nDo not make the same mistake of over-ordering like we did the first time around. Yemen Caf\u00e9 brings out complimentary freshly baked fatah (clay oven bread), soup (marag), and special house salad.\nWe ordered the Lamb Liver (Kibdah), saut\u00e9ed cubes of lamb liver, with onions, tomatoes served with their clay oven bread. The appetizer was big enough to share with 3-4 people. It was the best liver I've ever tasted in my life! It was so good, it didn't have the typical liver taste.\n \nThe entr\u00e9e we ordered was the shredded Lamb stew (Fahsah) served bubbling hot in a clay bowl. Once again, they bring out the warm clay oven bread. This stew is amazing! It's full of flavor and perfect for a cold winter day. \n\nDon't forget to taste the complimentary tea! You can drink this spice-infused tea with or without condensed milk. \n\nIt's like a hidden gem in the middle of Brooklyn.", "author": "Amanda D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-25", "description": "As am devouring this meal, happy foot dancing, I would take a trip to New York again for this. Great warm environment, nothing fancy but the incredibly good food", "author": "Jack S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-13", "description": "Words cannot describe how quickly I managed to fall in love with this place- seriously. My cousin suggested this place for a large group of us (7 I total) and they were more than accommodating and helpful to us. Our server immediately gave us bread, lentil soup, and zhug (a cold spicy sauce, has a lot of cilantro) to start. In regards to how they were, let's just say it was hard to not fill up easily on them. Now, time for the entrees!\n\n1. Lamb Haneeth- literally mouthwatering. I wish I lived closer to this place solely for this dish because trust me, it really is that good. I don't know how long they roast the lamb for but it literally falls off the bone and is perfection. Have every bite with the rice given as well!\n\n2. Zorbian Lamb- this is one of the few dishes that doesn't have the lamb separated from the rice but \"ready to eat\" as is. Simply put, there's no mixing of the lamb with the rice because they're already mixed in. This dish was also solid but was pale in comparison to the Haneeth. What I did like was the incorporation of scallions with the lamb to give it an extra kick. It was super flavorful and relatively spicy as well. \n\n3. Lamb Glaba- similar to the Haneeth in the sense that the lamb and the rice are separate but again, it couldn't compare to it. It tasted great don't get me wrong, it just wasn't anything special. Me being me, I also like dishes slightly different than the basic meat served with tomatoes and onions.\n\nSo why five and not four stars? Because, surprise surprise, the Haneeth is truly worth it. I see myself coming back if I'm ever miraculously in the area solely for this dish. On top of that, as mentioned, the service was wonderful and there's free tea in the back- help yourself because it's pretty damn good. Lastly, take note that the portions are gigantic so yes $23 for a meal seems like a lot BUT trust me when I say it's truly meant for two people so it's actually very reasonably priced.

I'm really picky, so generally scared to try new ethic food, but man am I happy I tried Yemen cafe.  I came for lunch, and for $11.95, got a delicious, home cooked chicken stew.  It came piping hot and felt like comfort food to me.  I also got a free mini soup.  I couldn't tell you what kind of soup it was, but the flavor was unique and the soup comforting.  I also got a huge pizza size bread which was fresh.  I couldn't believe how much was included in the $11.95 meal.

Before doing my shopping at Sahadi's I saw Yemen Caf\u00e9 across the street was open, so I popped in for an early lunch.  After walking in the cold for 15 minutes from the subway station to Atlantic Avenue I was in the mood for a hot soup or stew, so I ordered the Salta, a stew made from pureed fenugreek leaves and lentils and lamb stock that contained eggplants and zucchini.  Delicious and perfect for a hot day.  The Salta was flavorful and hearty but not overly filling, and the house-baked laffa bread (a flat bread baked in a tandoor-like clay oven) was pillowy, chewy and perfect for sopping up the Salta sauce.  \n\nNot 5 minutes after my food arrived the waiter walked past me with 2 plates of the lamb Haneeth for a table of Yemeni men next to me.  As the smell wafted past me I wished I'd ordered the Haneeth - the smell was amazing and the lamb looked tender and juicy.\n\nThe spiced tea was perfect for a hot day, although it was a tad too sweet for my liking.  \n\nThe restaurant was visited by the fire inspector when I was there - the owners kept offering him lamb but he kept turning it down and I'm sure he's been regretting it ever since!\n\nThe service was a tad slow, but not in a way that negatively affected my opinion of the restaurant, and I never complained, but nevertheless the house comped my meal.
