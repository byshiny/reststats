Delicious, crispy, savory awesomeness. Every bite had something spicy, something crunchy, something delicate, something meaty.  Loved the snack, but why oh why do they only have 2 people preparing these? It took 15 minutes after ordering to actually get the food, and we ordered before the lunch crush even began. I can't imagine how bad it got later. \n\nPut up a board to say where you are in line, get the market to fix the Wifi and text folks when their food is ready, get the buzzing hand held notification system or get more people cooking! These are delicious and I'd be happy to come again, but not if the wait is as eternal and mysterious as it was on our first visit.", "author": "Julie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-07", "description": "a little expensive honestly even though it was pretty good the price is a little hard to justify so I could only budget this place for special occasions even though I wish I could go more often", "author": "Serena W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-11-06", "description": "The two people who currently work here are incredibly rude.

The tofu was supposed to be ginger glazed and I hardly tasted that. I also thought that the crepe needed more things on it- it felt bare for a $14 total price tag. I didn't hate the food, but I definitely will not be going back for seconds.

I'm the type of person who wants to eat the leftover food from other people's tables, and I could not manage to finish this. I ordered the beef jian bing and about 50% of the meat was pure fat. The beef was incredibly salty, greasy (literally leaking out through the container), and otherwise, not very flavorful. This was made worse by the overwhelming amount of sauce smothered inside - I recommend others to ask for only a little of it.\n\nOne jian bing + a water bottle came to over $16...

Portion wise is very inconsistent, I've had it at least five times, sometimes the filling fill up the entire \"jidang bing\" while sometimes it's only half. I do not understand why the difference is that big. I'm not the only one who notice this, several friends of mine also had the same experience. Sometimes, there's sauce on the bing while sometimes sauce is on the side. Most of the time, the bing has really good texture, however, the one I had today was extra chewy, the dough was not \"relax\" enough I'll say. Overall, the quality is not very consistent. It's like buying lottery, I'm not sure if I'll get the good one today.

Ordered the Jian bing with pork and mild heat level. First time ever trying it and I loved it. I've had a scallion pancake but not with the extras. Definitely loved the additives. The food was well seasoned and flavorful. If this is inspired by Shanghai street food... I need to make a trip to Shanghai and get the authentic version.

I decided to trot down to the DeKalb Market Hall a couple weeks after it opened. It's a really rad venue and I've since heard a lot of my friends rave about JianBing, but what I ordered just didn't do it for me. I got the JianBing with beef. The good: The crepe is thin and crispy, the scallions are fresh and nice. The really neutral: Where is the deep flavor? There was a little bit of spicy sauce which is mainly spice with little flavor. I hardly remember the beef; it was just something I had to get through to finish the meal. Will I be back? Maybe. I'll definitely order something different next time, but I wasn't too satisfied by the combination I got the first time around.", "author": "Clarissa B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-26", "description": "I see a lot of negative comments about the history of Jianbing and how it is not authentic.

We each had a Jianbing, mine with pork and my wife's with tofu.  We also ordered a side order of the vegetable of the day - stringbeans.  Both Jianbings were good. They were tasty but there wasn't much filling.  There wasn't enough of anything for the price.  There was only a couple of tablespoons of pork or tofu, not much scallion or cilantro.  The side order of string beans was also very skimpy.  \n\nSo while the food tasted good it was hardly worth the $32 that it cost. It would seem as though the cost of the ingredients is very small and that Jianbing could easily double the amount of filling or vegetables for pennies but instead chose to save those pennies.", "author": "Clifford F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-23", "description": "Got the scallion pancake with tofu \"medium\" spicy and it was truly almost inedible.
