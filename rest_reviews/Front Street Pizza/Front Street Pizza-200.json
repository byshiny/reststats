A few times local folks mention to us to try out Gramaldis in Brooklyn. They said it was the best pizza place to go so we gave it a go. The lines though were huge and werent moving very quickly. So we decided to head back to NYC and ended up on our way to the subway.. came across Front Street Pizza.  \n\nAnd it didnt disappoint. The owner welcomed us and made sure our order came out, just like we wanted. The pizza slices were big and the sauce was very tasty.. and not very salty.  \n\nThe place was clean, well run and it seemed all the customers were very happy with being at Front Street.
