Maybe the consistency of the bagels is just not my style, as the interior just tasted stale to me. They also gave me whipped cream cheese instead of regular. \n\nAs a native Brooklynite, the bagels are sooo much better in other areas and for A LOT cheaper. Charging 2.25 for a bagel with cream cheese seems a bit much. There was a long wait for my bagel to be prepared as well. It wasn't horrible to the point that I will not return, but I will try to get my bagels from other places before coming here.", "author": "Nic P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-23", "description": "This place is located right by the courts.

Had two sesame bagels / one with jalape\u00f1o cheddar and the other with strawberry. Also ordered two French Vanilla coffees with skim milk. The bagels were very tasty, soft with just a bit of crisp. The strawberry cream cheese was very good - not too sweet and somewhat light except - it's cream cheese. The jalape\u00f1o cheddar was too rich. Solid coffees. They probably put too much cream cheese on but - hey who doesn't.", "author": "Bjorn P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-13", "description": "Best egg whites and turkey bacon on a croissant and a good cup of coffee!!!", "author": "Bella B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-06", "description": "This place is one of my favorite parts of my neighborhood.

I walk around the corner from the school I'm meeting in to find the highly recommended deli with \"awesome bagels.\" I walk in and pleasantly order a turkey sandwich with swiss, onion and lettuce on a garlic toasted bagel, patting myself on the back for not taking my fat ass to the McDonalds I stared at on my way in the door. As I waited, I noticed how delicious the cookies, cakes, doughnuts and brownies look. \"NO,\" I tell myself. \"This is a HEALTHY day. NO CRAP TODAY.\" I get my food and bottle of water for a modest 8 bucks and take my sandwich back to school, ready to dive in.\n\nAnd so ended the idea of a healthy lunch. There had to be 2 pounds of turkey on that bad boy!! BTW, I was so hungry I ate every freakin bite of that thing. But hey, 8 bucks for half a turkey isn't bad. Too much food aside, it was awesome.", "author": "Ashley B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-24", "description": "A bit pricey but the bagels are fresh and perfectly chewy and they are quite generous with the spreads. I had an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and was not disappointed at all. Unfortunately, my iced hazelnut coffee was a disaster. The ice they use must have absorbed the smells and tastes of their freezer and as it melted into my iced coffee it made it quite off putting. I would definitely come back for their bagels, but I will have to get my iced coffee elsewhere.", "author": "Cynthia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-06", "description": "Thanks Ron and the staff at La Bagel Delight for everything.\n I walked in on tuesday and needed delivery the next day for a Repass dinner and Ron did not disappoint.

New York bagels are the best, and La Bagel Delight knows how it's done.\n\nThe bagels are always made perfectly, and when you get them fresh, there is no need to toast them because the inside is warm, soft and doughy. If you don't like cream cheese so much, make sure you ask for a little because they really pile it on (that's how I love it, though). The lox is great, and I also love the flavored cream cheeses, especially scallion. Their other breakfast sandwiches and pastries are pretty good too, although the highlight is definitely the bagels \u0026 coffee.\n\nMy other favorite part about this place is that they are no-nonsense. If you come in at 8am on a work day, there will be a pretty big line, but they've usually taken everyone's orders already and they get you out of there so damn fast. Average wait time at La Bagel: 5-10 mins vs. average wait time at Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts (both also on court st.): 20 mins. La Bagel definitely wins.", "author": "Leah S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-02", "description": "I love bagels. There's nothing fancy about La Bagel Delight. It's a non-pretentious bagel shop that serves some awesome bagels.\n\nI was in Brooklyn for a week on business and ended up going to this place three times. After my first visit to LBD, I tried the other highly recommended bagel shop on Montague. Needless to say, I ended up coming back to LBD two more times.\n\nTheir bagels were fresh, chewy, and delicious. Their breakfast sandwich did not disappoint. They give you a generous serving of cream cheese with many varieties to choose from. \n\nOn the morning of my cross-country flight home, I ordered two bagels for myself to eat on the plane, and packed a half dozen bagels in my carry-on to bring home for my wife. They were that good!\n\nAnd BTW, they do accept credit cards.", "author": "Patrick W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-03", "description": "Everything bagel with fresh lox.

But oh, not a *regular* type of sandwich. Oh no dear reader. These circumstances called for a special type of sandwich...the kind made with a fresh, warm bagel packed with mountains of fresh turkey and cheddar cheese.

A friend of mine paid for her bagel with a $50 and didn't notice that she came away with $13 change for a $7 meal until long after she'd left the place. After some phone calls, she went back the next day and they handed her the missing $30, no questions asked. \n\nBut I love these bagels! You know how normally when you get a bagel, you can clearly tell the difference between the top half and the bottom half? The bottom half is always flatter while the top half is always more rounded and thicker. Well with these bagels, it's like you're getting two top halves. Way more bang for your buck! And they're fluffy and delicious. My co-workers and I come here all the time.

The egg sandwiches taste retchingly of vegetable oil.  The cream cheese is usually less than fresh, and the tofu cream cheese is an unmitigated disaster.  The tofu vegetable is a sloppy, wet mess.\n\nThe counterpersons are incredibly rude and look askance if you try to order more than one sandwich.\n\nLa Bagel Delight is the worst bagel store in New York City.
