This little stand is inside another building right at the entrance. More accessible than a AAA battery from the television remote. The place stank of delicious breads and meats. I knew I had found heaven. 2 amigos were manning the counter and the were having a grand ol' time. Super nice and hospitable. You wait about 5 minutes for your mouthgasm to be served and then you inhale the entire thing in about 2 minutes.

It's sooo tasty! I love the combination of veggies, very thinly sliced, lots of flavor, and the toasted bread is perfect!

Only in Brooklyn... I'm seeing these reviews about the Porchetta Sandwich and how great it is. I call at 8:15am and ask if they're making it at this time (yes, I eat like a maniac). The gal replies \"F*ck yes!\" Now, I love F-bombs, and this was the first time I've ever heard one in this context, so I hurried over.\n\nUpon arriving, I found the lady alone in her kitchen, and a customer waiting on a sandwich. I asked for the Porchetta, and she realized that I was the caller, and said that the only problem with it is that it won't be ready till 11am. It's possible she didn't hear me say the words \"at this time\" when I asked about Porchetta on the phone. It's also possible that I'm a victim of bait \u0026 switch. Either way, her F*ck yes turned into a big F*ck no!  \nAs I was walking away, she told me she'd make the best egg sandwich in NYC. I decided to go with it, support small business (especially a WBE), and cute my curiosity. In a small oven, she was heating up some ham, bacon, \u0026 turkey bacon. I went with the ham on Ciabatta bread with eggs fried loosely (she was good enough to ask how I liked the eggs cooked), and I had her add Chipotle mayo and cheddar. \nI think it's hard to turn such a commodity as an egg sandwich into \"the best in NYC\", but then again, you can't get any better than a perfect 10, so that puts her right up there with the best. \nThe only word to the wise I'd have for you if you want to try this place is to call in advance, be EXTRA CLEAR about what you want and when you want it, as the owner is very smart, a good salesperson, and the place seems to be run on a \"wild west\" fashion. \nI would also advise they give customers a napkin with their adorable little take-out baggie. \n\nIn all, if I'm in the area again, if probably return. Hopefully she won't spit in my food for this review, cuz I'm actually saying that the place is pretty darn good. I hope she grows with experience and succeeds!", "author": "Scott G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-02", "description": "Amazing!

Call early if you want the porchetta (but the others are good too, especially the breakfast sandwich); also, call ahead to avoid a wait.

We went there this morning based on high Yelp scores. Were a bit thrown when we walked in by the setup but perceived that after our sandwich was prepared, we could go upstairs to sit and eat. Wrongo!!!  The ONLY place to sit was by the door on one of three bar stools with a  ten inch deep counter facing a wall - and half of the undercounter was chuck full of stuff that the kitchen would need. \n\nThey should tell new customers what is going on. We would have walked down the street to one of the many other places serving breakfast. \n\nAgain, breakfast sandwich was great\nEnvironment for enjoying that sandwich - terrible \nOwners/staff - very nice but need to tune into what non- regulars might be expecting.", "author": "Jeff P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-09", "description": "First time here and the girl at the counter was super excited to explain the menu and offered great descriptions of the food.

Everyone seems to be raving about their porchetta sandwich and customers have given this delicacy its own name - \"The Sandwich.\" Seriously, when I took a bite of the crunchy ciabatta bread with the sweet jam sauce, I felt foodgasm for the first time, if not in. a long time.

They have a nice selection of beverages and chips to compliment your sandwich. The only main problem here is that their kitchen is too small. It can take up to 20 minutes to get your sandwich, but I think that maybe part of the beauty of this place.

Well-made and super delicious.  Only criticism is the wait time.  I almost missed a conference call due to the wait at 1:30pm.  So a head's up upon wait time after ordering would have been super helpful.  Otherwise looking forward to trying some of the other options.
