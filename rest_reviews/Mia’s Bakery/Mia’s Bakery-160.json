Added pounds are sure to come.  No amount of walking will cover for Mia's bakery.  Not sure they make all their own stuff as I saw identical cheesecakes in multiple deli across NYC.  Nevertheless the cheesecake was good; rich and not too sweet.  My husband had the triple berry pie.  Excellent, but not better than grandma's.", "author": "Susan K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-28", "description": "The best chocolate cake from Manhattan to Brooklyn!  \n\nNot only did the cake look exactly as I visioned  - it tasted absolutely delicious!

Plus they deliver. It's a no brainer \u200d\n\nMy favorite is the brooklyn blackout cake. I order it whenever I want to celebrate anything. A close second is their salted caramel cheesecake, which is super decadent. Portion sizes get you thinking you could save half for later, but the supreme deliciousness keeps you eating forkfuls until you're licking the plate.", "author": "Olivia B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-05", "description": "Oh yes, baby! Authentic multicultural bakery is in town! They pastries are amazing! I tried just about everything. My favorites are chocolate porcupine, heavenly brownie, banana cream pie (yum!), croissant donuts (yes!), various cakes. They portobello swiss croissants are very scrumptious. Everything is always fresh. At all times! This is a high end bakery so don't expect low prices. But it's totally worth it because the quality is unbeatable.", "author": "Rachel V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-10", "description": "Pretty legit bakery, with TONS of options (which is probably not so great if you're indecisive like me!)\n\nI just came by to pick up a few slices to-go; because I had such a hard time deciding, the woman at the counter told me some customer favorites. Ultimately, I got the Salted Caramel, Raspberry Chocolate, and Oreo Cheesecake. Each slice is $5.95, a bit pricey considering it's just a slice of cake, but these slices are pretty huge. If you don't have much of a sweet tooth, I'd reckon that one slice is good to share between 2 people.\n\nAll 3 slices were bomb dot com, but my favorite was the salted caramel...yummm.", "author": "Tashnuva E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-07", "description": "An excellent bakery.

The cakes that I received was absolutely amazing however when I got there they claimed not to have receive the order that I placed online while an associate was on the phone. Instead of waiting for the cakes I originally ordered I ended up getting some from he displays. I will give this place another chance only because the cakes was beyond delicious.

Absolute worst...in the BEST WAY POSSIBLE! Everything here looks absolutely amazing, if only I could physically fit more cake inside me. \n\nThe entire inside of the bakery looks and feels like Park Slope Brooklyn. Couple that with the most sexy looking pastries, it's a winner winner cake for dinner!\n\nI had the coconut cake and tres leche cupcake. Moist doesn't even describe how juicy these cakes were. Both were my favorite and I'm sure if I ordered anything else, it would all be my favorite.

Their vast selection is actually what attracted me in the first place. I ordered an Oreo cake online as well as a few bakery items in the store. I tried the creme brulee cupcake, tres leches cupcake, and a slice of strawberry shortcake.\n\nThe cupcakes were delicious and sweet, but not too sweet or dense. The creme brulee cupcake was soft and moist. It also has custard inside, underneath the caramelized sugar. The berries on top were a nice addition, as well. I had no idea you could ask them to warm it up, and it was still great despite being cold.\n\nThe tres leches cupcake was sweet, cinnamony, and had milk at the bottom of the tin. It was tasty and very creamy. I've never had tres leches cake before, so it left a really good impression on me. \n\nAs for the shortcake, my favorite, it was light and sweet, with fresh strawberries inside! The sponge cake was perfect. I'll probably go back for more shortcake next time I visit.\n\nFinally, the Oreo cake was so good. I expected it to be too sweet and too dense, but it was light and airy for being an Oreo cake. Inside, it's Oreo mousse layered between chocolate sponge cake. It was a hit with my group.", "author": "Amber L."}], "servesCuisine": "Cafes", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Mia\u2019s Bakery", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "139 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SM4ZOzR354iQi9Xvf1b68g/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+13479873194"}
