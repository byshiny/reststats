We ordered some red wine to warm us up (even though the martinis looked attractive!) and some appetizers to keep us from gnawing off our own arms.  We had the spicy Thai mussels, vegetable potstickers, steamed miso lobster dumplings, and seafood pancake.  Each was incredibly delicious, and, by the time we were done, I was already plotting coming back to have an entire meal of appetizers and dim sum.\n\nThe entrees were tasty as well.  I had seared salmon, the boyfriend had curry red snapper, and I can't remember what our dining companions had.  (I think his involved shrimp and hers pad thai.)\n\nAnother point in Chance's favor is the atmosphere: it's cozy without being cramped, stylish, and a little sexy.  Although I'm generally hesitant to use the term, it's a great \"date spot.\"", "author": "Kathleen B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-09", "description": "Food is so so. The waitress is unprofessional. I was there for a lunch on a weekend. The place had three customers. One of them were already done. it took like 20 min to bring a piece of Sushi. There was a group which I assume was a customer who come there often or friends of a waitress. She was talking about her personal life so loudly. I felt like I happened to be in some stranger's home and was eating my at a corner.\n\nThey also had a TV on.

However I was surprised that the server, when questioned, could not explain nor describe the menu items. 1 member of my party ordered sushi appetizer, what he recd as condiment ginger sticks for pickled ginger and jalape\u00f1o peppers for wasabi?  She was unfamiliar wtth the drinks menu and when it came time to order desserts, the server could not give a description as to what  a particular dessert is. I ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was terrible! It was a vanilla flavored paste with caramalzed sugar on top.  They're in need of a pastry chef.  \n\nCONSUMER BEWARE...carefully look at the bill. I'm in battle with them now over their tipping policy. Chance factors the tip into the meal. I don't have a problem with this my problem Is when you pay with a cc. The receipt (ROC) shows the total to be charged to the card and a line requesting another tip. I signed the cc receipt and gave $40 cash tip, forgetting the tip is included in the total. The server recd $80 tip! When brought their attention they did not deny the cash but refused to return it. A claim was filed with my bank and to my surprise they will not issue a credit due to my signing the receipt agreeing to the total due. Chase bank stated I have to prove I paid the tip in cash! I intend to get that money back and rpt this to BBB and FTC how they are robbing the consumer with these dbl tipping practice.", "author": "Jennifer C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-20", "description": "The Happy Hour brought me in and I must say, the drinks are insane.

I have been back countless times, and it's always the same.  Although, I will admit I only order 2 or 3 things that I rotate that contributes to this same-ness (but I can't help it - they are just too good!)\n\nI always find an excuse to suggest Chance to people when deciding where to eat on Smith and because of the diverse menu, everybody is usually satisfied.  The prix fix 3 course is a steal.  While the place is quite small, I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table since I tend to go on the earlier side (7).

I truly enjoy this spot, the decor is awesome. The waitresses and customer service are awesome. The food is delicious.

Great deal, right? \n\nIt would probably be an amazing culinary experience, however we made the huge mistake of ordering it for delivery.  The delivery man must have crashed his bicycle into a hurricane that sent him flying triple somersaults in the air, crashing into the Gowanus Canal, of which he had to get pulled out of the sludge in order to deliver our food. The food arrived so late that all of us had already resorted to eating marshmallow fluff on white bread by the time he had arrived. The lunch \"boxes\" were all mixed up, so it was a lunch of damp Pad Thai salad with crushed pork dumpling. \n\nI know I should not be so judgmental and just go to the restaurant to avoid the risk of tossed damp Pad Thai salad with crushed pork dumpling.
