I've made this same order a couple of times in the past, and both times they put all 4 rolls in one container. When I got back to work I noticed that they'd only given me 2 rolls, so just one order. They were eh. Didn't taste like much, rice paper wasn't fresh. I went back after work and explained the situation. They have several people look at the receipt and then tell me they have to look at the camera. I'm a little annoyed, but shrug it off and say ok and sit down.  But then I'm thinking \"soooo they don't believe me.\" They believe there's a possibility I came back hours later to try to get $5.25 worth of free food.\"  So I ask them, \"Do you not believe me?\" The young man at the cash register tells me they just have to check. I tell them that if they believed me, they wouldn't have to check. He then says \"well it was 6 hours ago\". So actually defending it. It just felt insulting, and I said so. So I wait about 10 minutes and one of the staff was very nice and apologized, and acknowledged she's made a mistake, and hands me my food. I tell her I want a refund (I know I should have said this before, but I originally wanted the food, I changed my mind after what happened happened). The guy at the front wordlessly hands me my refund. No apology, just the refund. I looked down and away from him, so I'm not sure what else he did. \n\nI get that restaurants have a small profit margin. I get that they have to protect themselves. I do. But to be made to wait 10 mins over $5.25 felt insulting. And honestly, it made me feel really sad.", "author": "Dana C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-26", "description": "I liked everything about this place!\n\nI was in the neighborhood with a couple of friends and one of them suggested we go to Hanco's for a quick bite. The space is small but clean and cute. I ordered the classic Vietnamese sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it. Unlike a traditional banh mi made of baguette that's so hard it hurts your upper jaw, the bread they use is soft and pillowy, toasted to perfect crispiness, which goes really well the roast pork and pate and their \"mayo\"-like sauce. If you are into spicy, you can also stuff some jalapenos in your sandwich and drizzle as much sriracha as you'd like. \n\nMy only wish is that they put their pho broth on their menu as a separate soup/side option. That would make me really happy.", "author": "Qianying Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-30", "description": "My go-to pho place in the neighborhood. I'm really glad that I live close to Hanco's. The store is nice and clean, but usually order delivery through Yelp or Grubhub. Delivery is always quick (never took more than 30 minutes) and there has never been any issues with apps or whatever. The beef pho and summer rolls are my favorites.

I was hesitant to try the pho, but I was immensely craving it . The flavor in the broth was so intense and flavorful, alongside the grilled pork. I was absolutely shocked that I can get quality pho around this neighborhood, and I felt envious for the people living around here.\n\nThe grilled pork was seasoned nicely and it was not greasy. The noodle had a nice chew to it and all the ingredients were fresh. Service was fast and the workers were polite. Absolutely nothing to complain about.

After reading through some of the reviews I decided to give it a try. I ordered the beef pho and I must say it was pretty solid beef broth.

However, whenever I get the chance to, I undoubtedly do, with the loyalty card in my hand!! You get a free sandwich after achieving 9 stamps, each of which is collected upon the purchase of 1 sandwich. Totally encourages you to indulge in more of their delicious banh mis! I love that they have a wheat bread option for the healthier souls. They make great sandwiches with different meat selections and concoct a great iced Vietnamese sandwich. Their pho is decent as well, but I prefer the banh mi over pho.

I don't know if they microwaved this stuff but it was just nasty. I could and should have returned it but was short on time and needed to eat.
