This diner is located literally down the block from me, so why it took me so long to try it? I do not know. \n\nNow, I am addicted!!!! It is my favorite brunch spot. I find myself craving it every Saturday morning after sleeping in. That is not only said for me, but my friends as well! \n\nWhen we first tried it, it was a little early, maybe 9 am, and the place was empty. They brought us freshly squeezed orange juice right after we sat down. Let me tell you, this was the BEST orange juice I have ever tasted in my life. It was so fresh and the pulp was so subtle, I could have inhaled a gallon right there. \n\nI have gone to Clark's Restaurant at later times and they do get a bit crowded, but they seat you pretty quickly. The customer service is great. The owners are very lovely and hospitable. \n\nThe restaurant offers a lot on the menu. So you have many options to satisfy whatever you are craving. As for me, lately I have been obsessed with avocado. So when I spotted the Clark's Poached Eggs with Avocado, I knew it was what I wanted. It comes with two poached eggs on potato pancakes with hollandaise sauce, avocado and bacon *mouth waters*. My bacon was overcooked when I got my meal, but I told the guy and he replaced it. Although the meal was a little pricy (about $12) it is filling and worth it!\n\nLove this place and can't wait to try more of their breakfast options!", "author": "Christina M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-15", "description": "For a clean atmosphere. For simple, made-you-smile fare. For a really good grilled chicken sandwich with fried onions and peppers. For a sunny afternoon in Brooklyn Heights with people you love. Clark's is the way to go. \n\nEven though I couldn't see a large group coming here--I only saw groups of three or four at most--I felt like Clark's was truly a family environment. Maybe it was the homestyle cooking, or the fact that our food came to us picture perfect or the surprisingly good reviews from the staunchest critic I know, my mom, somehow I felt surrounded by family. You know, the calm that comes over you after you've just eaten your first round of turkey dinner on Thanksgiving. \n\nI, personally, take a breath before my second round, and release the angst from my job, my life assignments, my eagerness to please, etc etc. Clark's was that warm moment of simple pleasure to just be. Stuffing my face with shoestring fries, almost picking at mom's dish of very tempting shrimp scampi over rice, and reveling in an okay ice cream sundae were the moments I'll remember most, and the reasons I won't hesitate to return.", "author": "Michelle W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-21", "description": "I really enjoyed Clark's. Went here for brunch with my brother and paid less than $25 for two people. Had some mimosas and don't really remember much after that. \nI love brunch. Love everything about it. I love drinking too much, blowing off afternoon plans, sleeping, waking up disoriented...\nClark's lets me do this in a fancy way without the fancy price. I will definitely be coming back!", "author": "Eduardo G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-07", "description": "I spent a few days in Brooklyn and I was looking for a 'mom \u0026 pop' restaurant to get breakfast at.  I stumbled upon 'Clark's' and immediately fell in love. \n\nFirst of all -  This is a really cozy little spot.  There isn't much room inside,  and it's pretty much constantly packed with customers.  As it turns out , there's a very good reason for that.  The food is delicious.  I tried both the Eggs Benedict and the Clark's Breakfast wrap.  The wrap was a light and flavorful blend of eggs , avocado, and bacon.  What's more, it arrived on my table less than a minute after placing my order.  Wow.   \n\nThe servers are attentive and warm,  and an older man who I can only assume was the owner even made sure I didn't forget my jacket on the way out.  This is exactly the kind of spot that gives 'hole in the wall' restaurants a great reputation.   \n\nIf you are looking for a great breakfast in Brooklyn, this is your spot.  Oh, and it's right next to the Clark st. subway (literally across the road)  so it's convenient to reach as well!", "author": "Alex Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-25", "description": "A nice haven for breakfast. Service is prompt and efficient. Classical music playing sets a tranquil tone. The standard diner food is unfussy and generally arrives promptly. Real sausages served for breakfast, not sausage patties. Very busy at the weekends: be prepared to line up after about 10 am.

I went on a Sunday about noon and it was packed but the owner found a spot for me and the service was very good. After reading some of the reviews I was ready for poor service but my waiter was excellent. \n\nI had the eggs and potato pancakes which is something we don't really have back in south Florida and at first I was like, \"this is ok but I'm not sure if I really like it\" but I found myself eating every bit of it even though half the portion filled me up.\n\nTypical American!\n\nSo yes I whole heartily recommend this spot.
