In the same vein as Marlow \u0026 Sons, this is a great place for cozy, wintry comfort food.  The downtown-rustic vibe is getting a little overdone these days but I won't hold that against them.  It also is significantly less expensive than this neighborhood and variety of restaurant could get away with charging.\n\nThe special of the night was a two-person steak dish, so my group of seven ordered four of them, and they were great.  The wine selection is limited but high-quality and inexpensive; the drink menu in the winter consists mostly of hot cider-ish offerings.  Desserts are excellent.  Overall it's an interesting, out-of-the-way sort of place -- so out of the way, in fact, that the staff openly offers to call a car service for patrons who aren't sure if they'll be able to catch cabs.\n\nOnly gripe: Service is slow.", "author": "Caroline M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-23", "description": "I'd give this place three and a half stars if I could.\n\nI was there on 12/17 around 8:30.  The wait was about 45 minutes for a table, but my date and I snuck in a bit quicker by sitting at the bar for dinner.  Which was fine by me, because a) the bar was decorated tastefully for Christmas, b) I got a great view of the tight, well-organized kitchen, and c) I could actually hear my date as I was sitting next to him, which would have been a bit difficult with a table between us.  This place is charming, intimate, and a bit romantic without being cloying, but it is certainly not quiet.\n\nThe place is BYOB, for now I guess.I wish I had taken better note of the menu, but I can say the food was very good but not great.  We had a free-form tart with vegetables and cow's milk cheese to start.  As other Yelpers have mentioned, it was very under-seasoned.  I actually second-guessed my opinion while I was eating it and assumed I got a few subpar bites-- but now that I read the reviews I see it is a common complaint.  \n\nFor the entree, I had a beautiful fillet of white fish (trout?) with smoked bacon and aioli.  It was delicious; no under-seasoning here, thanks largely to the thick smoky slab of bacon.  My only complaint was that the bacon was so charred it was difficult to cut through in parts, but otherwise a very simple and satisfying dish.  My friend had braised short ribs, I believe-- three gigantic specimens piled on a plate.   He devoured every morsel before I even finished my fish, so I think those must get two thumbs up.\n\nI can see this place having a great deal of potential.  I would certainly like to try it again in a few months.  Bring a good bottle of wine and a little patience to the door (and perhaps a salt shaker), and you should have a pleasant experience.", "author": "Romy V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-22", "description": "Love the ambiance, food, and drinks.  I went on Saturday night with a group of 9, no reservations.  We were told there would be an hour and a half wait but we could wait at the bar or in the back garden.  Our whole group had not arrived yet and we were told by the hostess to inform her when our whole group got there.  The bar was so crowded so we decided to look at the back garden.   Also packed.  Our third option was waiting in front.   The rest of our group arrived and we were sat promptly. \nSome in the group ordered appetizers, and everyone loved them.  Main courses were ordered and past around the table so everyone could try.  I ordered the Swordfish which was perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the cast iron chicken and a side of beets which were both amazing.  Everyone was pleasantly satisfied.  Desserts were ordered- guiness chocolate cake and the caramel dessert.  Both were amazing.\nService was great as well.  Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.  I may come back in the future if a group is coming, but I don't see it as a place that I would frequent often, mostly because of the location.

We got there early - about 6 pm - to avoid the lines and crowds and were immediately seated in the garden area. It was a pleasant spot, although the bugs were biting.\n\nWe all liked our meals. The presentation is very good and portion sizes are Manhattan sized as opposed to Tom's Diner sized. We didn't feel the prices were too high.\n\nThe sardine is terrific. The pork chop dish was excellent. The shrimp cocktail was perfect for a summer night. The roasted peppers - can't remember the name - were delicious. The cheese plate with home made crackers was great. By the time we left, the place was packed and very noisy. I'm glad we got there early.\n\nI wish the web site would show a current menu.

I liked the atmosphere, the waiters and bartender were really polite and nice, and it was in an interesting part of Brooklyn.  \n\nI had the cast iron chicken with the asparagus.  I could have been more daring, but I think that if a place can do something simple really well, then it's a good place.  These dishes were very good - but not great.  Both were very simple preparations, which is fine, and both had very flavorful sauces.  The chicken was a bit dry and the asparagus was a bit ordinary.  I could have made the meal myself, but that's not a totally bad thing.  Overall, I was satisfied, especially because you get a bit of a discount for trekking all the way out in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn this place is.\n\nI'd like to come back here and order some more interesting things because I like the vibe.

We waited, and this is not an exaggeration, 2 hours and 10 minutes for a table (shame on us, really-- but the host/owner kept telling us that it would only be another 1/2 hour, and after an hour of waiting already, we felt like we couldn't leave!)\n\nOnce we were finally seated, we were ignored for another 20 minutes. Among the many items we ordered off the menu, the mussels were raw, and the chicken (which NY mag RAVED about) was totally dry- and served by itself with a single roasted shallot. \n\nOur food came to $94. And we were not comped anything from the bill, nor did the waitstaff apologize or even say goodbye when we were leaving.\n\nThis was literally the only time in my adult life that I've left a less than 20% tip.

It was so tasty that my friend and I nearly re-ordered it later as dessert. \n\n2) Cast iron chicken: You can't go wrong with this plate that everyone recommends. This statement might sound incredibly foul to all vegans and vegetarians, but the skin was so perfectly crispy! Mmm! \n\n3) Red Wattle Country Chop on a bed of homemade sauerkraut.

I really did.  I went on Yelp and bypassed the 200-something excellent reviews and only focused on the really bad ones.  I dunno why I did that, but I wouldn't recommend it because I showed up for dinner at Vinegar Hill House early on a Friday night prepared for battle.  As most of the negative reviews here focus on small portions, a rude waitstaff and a terrifyingly smug and indifferent hostess, I wanted to be ready for any or all of the above.\n\nThat said, my date and I arrived around 6:45 on a Friday evening.  The hostess, who does indeed wear scarily unnecessary painted-on jeans up to her midsection and who does indeed carry an air of I-don't-give-two-shits-what-you-think-of-my-poor-fashion-choices-nor-do-I-care-about-anything-at-all-for-that-matter, greeted us at the door, took our names and said a table would be ready in about 10 minutes (despite the fact that there were a few 4-tops open and another 4-top that could have been broken down into two 2-tops, but I digress).  This was all fine as there were two available seats at the rather small bar and I felt like having a cocktail before dinner anyway.  We sat and the super nice bartender served us up some super tasty drinks in a super friendly manner.  So, for all those negative reviewers out there, they must have gotten rid of the asshole bartender.  Anyway, about 15 minutes later, that 4-top that could become 2 2-tops I'd noticed earlier was broken down and we were seated.  So far, so good.\n\nOur waiter was perfectly sane and didn't slack at doing his job in the slightest.  He was also perfectly nice, too.  None of the appetizers on the menu that night sounded very appealing, so my date and I decided to forgo any apps and first-course pastas and opted to order a couple of entr\u00e9es and a couple of sides to go with our bottle of wine.  I ordered the Red Wattle Country Chop and holy hell.  Just, holy hell.  It comes sliced and most of the pieces were cooked to absolute perfection.  The sauce with the chop was nothing short of amazing but the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was undoubtedly the cheddar grits that comes with the chop.  The grits are to die for.  TO.DIE.FOR.  A couple of the pieces of pork were simply too rare for my liking, but I suppose that's all relative.  On the whole the chop is a win-win and I was satisfied with the portion size.  Full disclaimer, though: The waiter did tell me up front it'd be about 25 minutes for the pork, to which we said, no problem, but could we have some bread in the interim, to which he said, of course.\n\nMy date ordered the striped bass, which was, admittedly, quite small.  In fact, the table next to us was going to split the striped bass entr\u00e9e, but when they saw how big my chop was compared to how big the bass was, they snagged the waiter and changed orders.  The bass is more like an appetizer portion, to be honest.   I didn't taste the bass, but my date said that it was decently cooked, although the lime dressing it was drizzled with was slightly off-putting.  \n\nWe shared the side of mashed potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts.  Do yourself a favor and get those damn potatoes.  They were nearly on par with the cheddar grits that accompanied the chop and reminded me of a warm and creamy potato salad.  I could have eaten 2 more beakers of those taters.  The brussels sprouts were an interesting choice as they didn't really go with either of our meals.  They kind of tasted like sprouts with Chinese five spice or caraway or something.  They just didn't fit, but we ate them anyway because that's how we roll.\n\nI was wondering throughout the duration of our meal at Vinegar Hill House when the bloodshed would come and when I would be met with all the truths of the negative reviewers' comments.  I was so prepared to be met with severe disappointment, but it never came.  Vinegar Hill House gets my vote for now.  But here's a tip: don't read only the few-and-far-between bad reviews before you go somewhere, especially Vinegar Hill House.  They didn't get over 200 positive reviews for nothing.", "author": "Catherine C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-28", "description": "My experience at Vinegar Hill House was easily one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. \n\nMy family and I had plans to try out Vinegar Hill House on a Friday night at 6pm when they open. We tried to make a reservation but were told they don't take reservations, so we figured if we showed up right when they opened, it would be fine. So we got there a little early figuring we could grab a drink at their bar or somewhere in the neighborhood. Not the case. We had to wait outside while they and their sister restaurant on the corner got everything ready for service. (If I were running the only two restaurants in this remote area of brooklyn, I think I would want to be making money off of people waiting for dinner and open one of the places at 5:30, but whatever.) While we waited for them to let us in, I literally got 10 mosquito bites in 15 minutes...the place is INFESTED. When they finally opened up, there was one party ahead of us, maybe 5 or 6 people who got sat right away. When we went up and said we were a party of 3, we were told that they could offer outdoor seating, but they were full of reservations for indoor tables. The place was completely empty and the (extremely elitist, pretentious) host had a list with 5 reservations marked down. We told him that we were told that they do not take reservations, but apparently they take reservations for parties of 4 or more. So being a party of 3, we are basically screwed because we can only fit at a 4-top but they refused to grant us a reservation for one. We spoke to the manager to try to show him how silly this logic is and he was just as unaccommodating, so we left. \n\nI don't care how cute their decor or good their food! There is no excuse for treating potential customers who were about to spend a good couple hundred bucks at your establishment in such a disrespectful manner. Frankly, I don't know how these people are still in business. There are too many good restaurants in this city to bother wasting your time somewhere where they have zero regard for their clientele.

My boyfriend and I arrived at around 10pm on a Saturday night.  It was still very busy, but the hostess promptly took our name, we got a drink at the bar, and we were seated in no time.  The decor is fun to look at, and I like that the restaurant is in a random little neighborhood.  Our waiter was very nice, and very helpful.  We got a cheese and pate plate that was very tasty.  So far, five stars.  For entrees my boyfriend got their famous cast iron chicken, and I got the pork chop.  The chicken definitely lived up to it's hype--the juiciest I have ever, ever had.  So fantastic.  We also got some brussels sprouts with hazelnuts (I think) which were addictive.  However, my porkchop was pretty much inedible.  The flavoring was great but the chop itself was so fatty.  It was just...gross.  There was barely any part of it that I could sort through to enjoy.  I guess I could have sent it back, but I kept feeling hopeful that the next part of it would be fine since the flavor was so good.  \n\nThere are definitely some good things happening here.

Have to say, pretty outstanding meal.  I opted for the rabbit pasta (which clearly had a much fancier name that I've since forgotten).  It was nicely seasoned and rich.  The portions, which seemed kind of small when served, complemented the richness of the sauces.  Way to go.\n\nThen again, I might have just already been full from the nine thousand appetizers we ordered, including goat-cheese and squash torte with sage, chicken liver pate with pistachios (I'm not usually a fan of organ-related food, but this was smooth and delicious), cheese plate with crostini and arugula salads.\n\nThe wines, both red and white, were fantastic - the list seemed somewhat extensive, albeit pricey.  Finally, the desserts - especially the vanilla bean flan, were stellar.  The only thing I might have passed on was a grapefruit spongecake.  \n\nI'm also pretty sure I saw the guy from Hellraiser sitting at a table nearby - alongside a soccer mom and some douche with a turtleneck.
