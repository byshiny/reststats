So I went with such great expectations and eagerly joined the line behind 20 other equally eager diners. My friend and I wanted to find out how long the average wait is and he approached the guy at the door. He was pretty brusque and gave us a 45-minute figure. Alright, not a problem. Amazing, out-of-the-world pizza inside! \n\n40 minutes passed and we were duly seated upstairs. As I walked in, I was surprised because several tables were free. Once seated, it took forever for the waiter to attend to us and that became the trend for the evening. And the staff were so indifferent and unhelpful that it ruined the evening for me. I wonder if it marred my taste bud judgement, but the pizza was really a disappointment. (Note: I'm vegetarian). Or maybe the deciding factor is your predisposition towards the baked/ charred flavor. The only saving grace for me was the Coney Island cream soda. \n\nBut after all the hype and excitement and expectation, the soda couldn't save the day - not even close!", "author": "Surabhi V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-09", "description": "I live in NY and have always avoided coming here because I heard how awful the lines were.  I don't care how good anything is, I am not waiting on a line for over an hour.\n\nWith that being said, I finally went with a visiting friend in January.  The lines were OK, still out the door, but I only needed to wait about 15 minutes.\n\nI was so excited because I heard how amazing this pizza was...unfortunately, the pizza was not nearly as good as I was lead on to believe.  The pizza was good, but not crispy (soggy actually).  The toppings were OK, but nothing special.  I am so happy I didn't wait online for over an hour because I would have been very pissed.\n\nI think at some point this place was awesome, but perhaps the more famous it got the more it compromised itself.  The problem is, the myth of this place is so powerful and ingrained in NYC folklore that perhaps it added to the taste like a seasoning would.\n\nI wouldn't stop anyone from trying this place, but I'd at least try to lower their expectations.  At least that way, they can decide if it's worth the line.", "author": "John S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-30", "description": "Wait time is atrocious.

YES!\n\nthe wait was long, but not RIDICULOUSLY long. mind you, it WAS only 4:30pm when we got in line. we were inside by 5:30, though it seemed like the line didn't move for a good 30 minutes or so. when we did get inside, there were many empty tables and it was quiet and tame compared to the bustling crowd outside. hm. i wonder why. maybe they wanted to keep it nice and peaceful inside, which was honestly cool. but really? make all those people outside wait pointlessly long?\n\nmy sister and i got a large regular pizza with pepperoni, italian sausage and fresh garlic (we finished the entire thing). our pizza was goooooood. the mozzarella was nice and fresh and there wasn't too much cheese or sauce to the point where it was heavy. the pizza ingredients were balanced really well, without there being too much of anything. it was a bit salty, but i'm guessing it's because of the pepperoni. the garlic added a nice kick. the crust was thin but not TOO thin. it wasn't as crispy as i would have liked though the bottom was BURNT. that's probably the worst thing about the whole experience -- not even the long line but the BURNT CRUST. normally i will eat every single bit of my crust, but in this case, the bottom was so burnt that it was black, charred and inedible. sigh. i should be giving this place 3 stars because of this, but i enjoyed my pizza so much i'll still give it 4 stars! worth a try if you're in the area and have some time to spare :) though i wish i had also tried lombardi's!", "author": "Beatriz U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-20", "description": "I was a frequent patron of Grimaldi's Pizza. returned recently with 4 friends and was extremely disappointed. The pizza and quality ingredients have gone way down hill. There was barely any tomato sauce on the pizza , like maybe half a teaspoon on a large pie. The cheese was not fresh mozzarella but cheap packaged mozzarella cheese and way too much of it on the pie, as well as way too much low,grade parmesan cheese which made the pizza too salty.The crust was mediocre. i get better crust and pizza at my local slice stand. By the way Grimaldis does not  serve beer or wine since they do not have a license. I am really sorry to report this. it was a beloved place to me and now has turned into a tourist trap living on it's past great reputation.

The mozzarella was not too gooey but still delicious. We were satisfied with the large size of the pizza (despite ordering a small) and it certainly tasted great. Our waiter never made eye contact and seemed standoffish. However, one of the other busboys/waiters packaged my leftovers and was better. Also the toilet seat in the women's bathroom was broken and one of the lights was out. A bit surprising given the notoriety of this establishment.

I have never been around so many angry cutomers at a restaurant my entire life.  First of all, I think Grimaldi's new spot is about twice the size of the old spot, yet the oven is still the same size as it was at the smaller location.  Next, I'm not sure if the workers are supposed to be somewhat rude on purpose (for ambiance?) or they really just do not like their job.  We lucked out and arrived as they were cleaning the ovens and knew that there was going to be an extra long wait for our pizzas (they say it on the menu).  But we definitely did not expect to spend a total of 3.5 hours at the restaurant.  1 hour in the freezing cold to get seated, another hour and a half for our food and about an hour to eat and pay our bill.  Pretty much filled up our entire night.  \n\nOn the way out, I noticed that the oven can handle about 4 pizzas, so let's do some math here.  There are maybe about 30 or so tables in this place.  Every table orders about 2 pies.  So 60 pizzas.  Every batch in the oven takes about 15-20 minutes.  So when you have a 45 min window where you are taking orders from seated guests and no pies coming out, you have pretty much put yourself in a pretty big f'ing hole.  If you want a barometer on how long we waited, the 3 of us pretty much fell asleep while waiting for our food.  Waiting about an hour in 25 degree weather will drain you more than you can imagine.  \n\nOnto the pies.  They were very, very good.  We ordered one plain and one pepperoni and my only complaint is that I wish they had a little bit more sauce on them.  I was going to ask for a side of sauce but seeing how service was that night, I probably wouldn't have gotten it until after our pies were either finished or cold.  \n\nSo why the 4 stars.  The 4 stars is based on the pizza alone.  It is really very good and wins in my taste test versus Lombardi's.  The service could use some work but I understand that it was opening night, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  However, they should consider adding another oven, offering take out orders (and not hanging up on people after saying NO), and let people enjoy their experience.  Being a pizza junkie, I wanted a picture of the oven and instead I got a picture of some guy waving his hand in my face instead.  \n\nWould I come back to this place, probably not.  The pizza is very good, but time is money, and the time invested here just doesn't justify the pizza.", "author": "JP T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "We came here about four in the afternoon, which is a good time, because we didn't have to wait in a long line.
