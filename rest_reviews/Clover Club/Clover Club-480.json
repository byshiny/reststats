The bar tenders are so good, that all you have to say is that you like, gin and sweet and they will concoct something that tastes good.\n\nThe drinks i ordered off the menu weren't too memorable, but tasty.

Bartenders (or \"mixologists\" if you want to sound like a d-bag), wear ties, collared shirts, and full length aprons and ply their craft behind an antique looking solid wood bar stocked with all manner of drink making odds and ends. What makes Clover Club different from other places (aside from the fact that it's located in Brooklyn and not Manhattan) is that they actually serve a number of legit pre-prohibition cocktails and, given the quality of cocktails, the prices aren't bad -- at a minimum, the prices aren't Manhattan-level bad.\n\nAs far as service goes, a couple of friends have said that their service experience at Clover Club was substandard. However, my experience has certainly differed from theirs. The past two times I dropped in for a drink, I arrived before the bar was slammed -- once in the early afternoon and once in the early evening. Each time, I sat at the bar and was served by the bartender with the full beard (sorry, nice gentleman with full beard, I've never actually caught your name) who was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Given how popular this place is, I could see service levels falling off as the crowd grows, but I'm not interested in fighting through mobs of well-to-do New Yorkers debating the relative quality of writing in the New Yorker over the past decade, so I make a point to hit Clover Club at off-peak hours. The other upside to an early arrival is that Clover Club offers solid deals (specifically, a $7 cocktail list) if you can catch happy hour.\n\nClover Club is never going to be the Brooklyn equivalent of Cheers. The vibe of this place is altogether different and, if Cheers is what you're expecting, you'll probably be disappointed. This place is an homage to cocktails made in the way that Jay Gatsby would have consumed them. Quality ingredients, creativity, and a respect for the hertige of drink are all in abundance at Clover. It's not my most frequented bar by a long-shot, but when I'm in the mood for something exceptional, this is where I look first.", "author": "John H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-22", "description": "People may say the nouveau, speakeasy cocktail thing is getting overplayed in the city, but personally, I see nothing wrong in a great drink and a candlelit ambiance. Clover Club does both well, and serves up one of the better cocktails I've had in NYC. \n\nAs to be expected, drinks are pricey, and if you come with a group there is usually a bit of wait (though seems to be much faster seating for 2). I prefer the backroom, where you can enjoy some fireside warmth with your date (or friends!). Tasty little snack menu too (I would order the cheese plate again just to taste the absurdly delicious syrupy cherries that come with it) \n\nSadly I no longer live a 5 minute walk away, but I will surely be back here regularly.", "author": "Lucy M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-13", "description": "Occasionally the service can be really backed up.  If it wasn't I would give it 5 stars. The drinks are amazing.

Some of the best cocktails I've ever tasted in NYC, let alone Brooklyn.

Was so enticed by the description of the crisps that I ordered them, but I couldn't taste the duck fat (just tasted like potato flavored grease solidified into dry brown crispiness) and the truffle aioli was great but made me really want frites to dip in it. The fried oysters were tasteless but perfectly fried and sat in a beautiful green herbaceous puddle on top of the half shell - probably should have ordered the raw ones. Although I know I should have ordered a cocktail, I had to order a beer in anticipation of the fried oysters.

It is a reincarnation of an old Philadelphia gentlemans club. The tables are small and wooden, the bar the same. The bartenders are friendly, and skilled.\n\n I ordered the Clover Club cocktail, it's namesake being the very bar I was at. It is a frothy mix of gin, egg white, citrus and raspberry syrup with a speared raspberry on top. It was a well-balanced cocktail. It was sweet, tart and refreshing and I'd order it again if given the chance.\n\nI wouldn't recommend that you go well out of your way to go to Clover Club, but if you're int he area, the experience is more than solid.", "author": "Nik B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-28", "description": "Just had an amazing brunch at Clover Club.

None. Period. There are exceptions. Such as the standing up at the front bar on the weekends. And that I wish I could but I can't afford to eat and drink there everyday. Man, what a bummer.

A well rounded mix of folks who have had it with the Smith Street crowd. \n\nLuckily this place has hired the best and is in a great spot. Did a great job on the decor, the ambiance and the snacks. Of note, lamb burger, mac and best cheese of your life.

She suggested this place because in her words the \"cocktails are artisanal and potent! \" We had the lamb burgers with goat cheese. We also ordered the crisps. Let me tell you the lamb burger was off the hook! They remind me of Greek beftekia. The crisps were so good we were competing to see who would get to finish them all. The sauce that comes with the crisps was like ranch but a billion times better. To wash that down I had The Slope cocktail which consists of Rye, sweet vermouth, apricot brandy and bitters. Probably one of the best cocktails I ever had!! They even  bring you backup inside  a tiny glass buried in ice so that when you're done with your first drink the backup is all nice and cold ready to drink.

In a particular episode Ted Allen picked the Clover Club for their Gin Blossom cocktail.  Being a fan of gin, and the fact that every restaraunt we've been to that he has picked on that show has been fantastic, we decided we had to go there the next time we were in NYC.\n\nSo we went.  The place is not in a touristy area, big bonus!  Nice atmosphere, lots of wood, tin ceilings, leather booths, low lighting, it's just a great setting.\n\nSo the drinks, which is why we went here,  second to none!!!  I have never had cocktails this tasty.  We were just blown away on how good they were.\n\nSo the next night(which was our last night in NYC for that trip) we wanted to go back.  We get there and wow was this place crowded, much more than the night before.  The we see a live band.  I shudder as at many of the bars near us a live band means horrible Def Leppard covers.\n\nIt turns out this was a jazz band that plays jazz from the 20's.  Yes 1920's!  They were FANTASTIC!!! (just google Michael Arenella).  The music just brought the evening to the next level.\n\nNow everytime we go to NYC(which is somewhat frequent, but not enough for us, we love that city) we always go to the Clover Club for great drinks, food(I love the steak tartare, my wife loves the crostini, the crisps are great too), and Michael's band on Wednesdays.", "author": "Steve P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-17", "description": "Clover Club is a real neighborhood gem!

I was working late but needed to buy a gift at a neighboring store that was closing before I'd be able to leave work.
