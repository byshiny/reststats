They were all incredibly delicious.  The pastries were so light and not too sweet.  The baguette was absolutely awesome...crunchy and airy in the inside.  They are expensive, but the quality is so far superior that it's worth it.  Much better than balthazar...even better than Daniel Boulud!", "author": "K.
