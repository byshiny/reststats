I'm a die hard carnivore but I order from here once every couple of weeks.  Basil soy protein with extra protein, scallion pancakes and hot and sour soup are as good as any (meat containing) pan-Asian dishes in the city.

I'm recently vegetarian and try to eat mostly vegan so I have become a regular of this restaurant.  My favorite dishes are Watercress Salad, Bi-Bam Bap, and Malaysian Curry Stew (which is much improved since the first time I ordered it).  Great non-alcholic drinks like Wild Ginger ale and Passion Fruit Ice Tea.  Do not miss the pumpkin cheesecake!  \n\nThe ambiance is relaxing.

It's not authentic Asian food, more just Asian inspired, but the dishes are flavorful and satisfying. I'm a big fan of the bibimbap, and the pumpkin soup it comes with is delicious. \nThe black pepper seitan is also extremely good. \n\nI'm not vegan, but I order from here on Seamless regularly. I've also been to the Brooklyn location a couple times and the service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual.

They have a huge selection and it's all vegan. It is also good for groups with people with different tastes. I was even able to order a dish that was reminiscent of seafood and was quite impressed. However, the service here is not the best. The waiters were a little slow and awkward and then would overly apologize for a mistake. I will certainly come here a lot, but because of the food and not because of the service and atmosphere.", "author": "Emily L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-22", "description": "Best dish : basil ginger soy\nWorst dish : sizzling tofu\nOverall nice atmosphere ..: food pretty good", "author": "A C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-11", "description": "What a find! This place saved my friends and I when we were all hungrover (hungry and hungover) last week. Delicious food, constantly refreshed icey-cold water, and a nice peaceful atmosphere.\n\nAs a vego, I obviously appreciated the extensive menu but all my non-vego friends enjoyed their meals as well. I can recommend the teriyaki seitan, and the miso that came with the lunch special was really tasty. Only criticism is that there was too much ginger in my grapefruit, apple and ginger juice - but hey, it's good for you.\n\nReasonably priced too, particularly at lunch time.10/10 would Wild Ginger again!", "author": "Alexandra P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-12", "description": "It seems this place is under new management, new wait staff, new chef. it used to be good, now keep your distance. The surly waitress asked us to eat our meal quickly so they could seat others, I replied - \"That depends on how quickly you bring it.\" Not quickly it turns out. Then I asked for no broccoli and get a plate full of it - Ms. Too Busy To Be Nice, says - 'Can't you just give it to your Husband?\" I say, 'but I'd like vegetables with my meal.\" She goes back to the kitchen and my meal comes back dripping in a sweet sauce with zucchini, basically ruined. I ask for another plate so I can salvage a few lone pieces of soy protein from Monsanto's sugar rush, but I don't get it. Put the sauce on a napkin, NO ONE comes to ask me anything, to clean the mess or to offer condolences.

It was a $10 minimum but all I wanted was that cake. It's a rich chocolate cake with layers of whipped peanut butter cream. Skip the pad-thai (it's not very good here), bypass all the other funky vegetarian options (unless, that's your thing), and head straight for the dessert. Nothing else like it.
