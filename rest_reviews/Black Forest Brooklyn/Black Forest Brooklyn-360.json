First was terrible, bad service, most of the menu not available, ok, it just opened. Second, time? Fantastic. Great food, schnitzel was great, friend of mine went on and on about the mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, service was good. Third time? We sat at a communal table with two strangers and a pile of dishes and glasses from the previous diners. We sat there for 20 minutes with the remains of someone else's food and no service. The bus boy seems to think they are our dishes now, but still doesn't clear the table. Finally flagged down a waitress from a different area who was clearly annoyed at having to take our order, and I don't blame her, her co-worker was way out of her depth. And then, finally, food was just not good - the exact same things we'd gotten on the second visit were not only lackluster, they seemed to be made differently (worse) -  like they must have run out of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut and got them from a box/jar, fries were soggy, etc. Seems like some potential, but I got about one more visit before the sheer mess the place is makes me finally wise up and stop wasting money for frustration and middle of the road grease and starch that seems to be what you're likely to get.", "author": "Paul R."}], "servesCuisine": "German", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Black Forest Brooklyn", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "733 Fulton St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SeINe6YLs2K5rJB8tUD8rg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17189350300"}
