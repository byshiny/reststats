It would turn out that they had some good beer on draft. I ended up ordering the pub burger and it was good. If you want fries with your burger, it can be added as a side for an extra $3.50.\n\nThere's a fairly small bar section with a couple of TV's just as you enter. Even though I was by myself, it was a bit early for dinner, so I ended up getting a table in the back where there's many tables. \n\n*Founders oatmeal stout nitro*\nI love a good oatmeal stout and the nitro version is almost always better. This was a good beer to go with any burger.\n\n*Pub burger*\nThis was a nice delicious bacon cheese burger with lots of grilled onions. This was one of the better burgers that I've eaten in my journey.\n\n*Side of Fries*\nA bit pricey for a side, but I just couldn't eat a burger without some fries. I'm used to eating at most places where fries are included.\n\nOverall, their burger was good enough that I would not hesitate to come back here if I'm ever staying in Brooklyn again.", "author": "Emil C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-14", "description": "Burgers are amazing and they have great toppings.

Super juicy and the bun was soft and nice! I've tried a lot of burgers and this is one of the better ones i had. The meat-bun ratio was exact. The price is today normal and worth it. \n* I must add that the fried halepenios on top of my burger were not really hot and i was looking fora but spicier but it didn't change the burger equality.", "author": "Hadar P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-21", "description": "Two 8 Two has really solid burgers, a friendly staff and some decent beers on Draft.

I was very displeased with the service, i thought being in a diverse neighborhood that i would be treated fairly I believe i was racially profiled because I'm African American!

Burgers are so good I haven't tried the hot dogs, but I want to.  No fancy topping really, just the basics done really well.  That said, I love the poblano peppers on the burger. Great combination.\n\nSolid selection of beers, and they have boozy milkshakes.  I haven't tried the later, but they sound good.\n\nThere is happy hour, but it is limited.  And a couple of TVs at the bar, but defnitely not a sports bar feel.", "author": "Craig Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-15", "description": "Pros:  - Delicious burger on a potato (?) bun with absolutely yummy \"house\" sauce that definitely has mayo and ketchup in it (I won't ask for the secret, promise!). \n            - Very reasonably priced, especially for the area! \n            - yummy, refreshing drinks\n\nCons: - let's just say that before even going through half of his buger, hubby ordered seconds . Indeed, it is not a huge burger and while it's pretty delicious, for a grown boy of ... Well, just not enough\n           - the yummy drink could use a bit more \"adult beverage\" to it and a bit less \"Shirley temple\" \n\nI do like this joint and would recommend a visit.", "author": "Tatyana R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-16", "description": "I stumbled upon two8two on a Friday night with my boyfriend after our plans to see an amazing comedy show got cancelled.  (The only reason this is relevant is because I was really unhappy with the way our night started to turn out and where ever I went had to be at least decent without me ripping off some heads..)\n\nOk, so the important stuff - burgers, fries, good drinks.\nWe both got the breakfast burger which had egg and bacon on it.  The burgers look smaller than a normal burger joint but they are more than filling.  Everything was juicy and delicious.  I got the sweet potato fries and my boyfriend got the onion rings - both awesome.  He originally wanted regular fries and it was just a good mistake I guess.\n\nFor drinks - I got the seasonal cider and he got a bourbon lemonade.  I'm not a bourbon fan and that was also very good.  Mixed drinks were only $8 - which for the city, was really reasonable.\n\nThe place wasn't crowded at all, we got a seat right away without reservations and even after dinner there were plenty of seats open at the bar to watch the basketball game.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend.", "author": "Eva B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-07", "description": "Great vibe and great food! Would highly recommend the chicken sandwich, it's charred ever so slightly and has the cheese perfectly melted on it. \nTwo8Two sauce is terrific too, whatever it is-and I say that as a compliment because it seems like at this point \"secret sauce\" is all the same at every restaurant (lookin at you @Shake Shack)!", "author": "Alex W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-02", "description": "Burgers was delicious.

If you're looking for amazing burgers I would probably go elsewhere. \n\nThese burgers reminded me of an upscale Shake Shack, only much less oily. I really enjoyed the jalape\u00f1o margarita though. It was well made - nice and spicy! \nI didn't expect the burgers to be on the smaller side so my bf and I ordered one to share after we had finished our first burgers. We got sweet potato fries on the side which were pretty good, not too crispy but not soggy either. \n\nWe ordered the two8two burger (10$), Half and Half Burger with a fried egg (12.50$ bc of the egg add-on) and then lastly the Billy Burger (8.50$). All solid burgers - not oily, fairly juicy and had tasty grilled toppings. We both liked that the burgers were not heavy. The grilled onions in the Billy Burger and the roasted poblano chiles in the Two8Two burger were a delicious addition to the burger, which added a lot of flavor.\nMy boyfriend had the half and half burger. He wished that it would have been a bit more juicy but it was still definitely good. This one was particularly stuffed because of the fried egg so it was a bit hard to eat. \n\nI appreciated that this place is affordable. Nothing above 12$ unless you get lots of extras. I would definitely come back.

Friendly service from both the bartender who checked our IDs and the one who served us -- including an A+ beer recommendation. Enjoyed their draft selection and the environment (casual and welcoming). Oh and FYI given the current heat wave: Cold AC in this place, especially if you sit near the middle of the bar!\n\n(Why not 5 stars? Their food menu left a little to be desired. Sure, it's a burger joint \u0026 I'm a vegetarian, but it seems many other places nowadays dress up the veggie burgers with something beyond lettuce \u0026 tomato, offer a delish grilled veggie sandwich, or have more sides on the menu.
