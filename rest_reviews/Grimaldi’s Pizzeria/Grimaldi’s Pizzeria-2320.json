I am also a purist.  I like my pies basic, that way you can taste the quality of the ingredients and appreciate the textures.  \n\nReasons I love this pizza:\n\nOnce you get seated and order, the pizza comes quick (I guess because the ovens are so hot the pies cook in no time)\nWhen they delivered it to our table, the pie wasn't too hot to eat so you can just inhale the first slice.\nThe second I tasted this pie, I knew it was the real deal.  I heard the faint sounds of angels singing as the chewy / crispy dough danced around my mouth.  \nNext, the fresh taste of the sauce and mozzarella cheese with just a hint of basil, is what these ingredients want to be when they grow up.\nIt's cheap!  You can spend much more money eating at a chain restaurant, but why would you want to?  If you are in Manhattan, do yourself a favor and cross the Brooklyn bridge for the best pizza this side of Rome.", "author": "Tony M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-05-31", "description": "Its 2013 and they still don't take credit cards??

What makes it so special is the final flavors and the texture of their pizza that results from this one of a kind oven.  The city prohibits any more of these ovens because of the risk that they may burn down an entire establishment.  However, they are still privileged (I don't know why) to be exclusively using one from way back when this pizza joint began and making NY's #1 pizza.\n\nWhy is it SO DAMN GOOD?\nBecause of the special oven, the pizzas are cooked flawlessly with ingredients melted on top, slightly doughy in the middle and still with a hint of crisp-and-chew on the very bottom.  When you take that first bite, that melted cheese will just come right at you and you won't even know what hit you.  You may be slightly interrupted as you try to control the strings of cheesiness dribbling down your mouth but your tongue will get a sliver of the tomato sauce and hint of basil as you notice a slight smokiness (burn from the coals) that rounds out your mouth as you chew your way and push that pizza down towards stomach heaven.\n\nHow do they do it?\nWell, on top of all this, they use very FRESH ingredients. They use fresh mozzarella slices instead of shredded cheese, which results in super cheesy-stringy-neverending yummy pizza.  You would imagine them prepping the dough, then the tomato sauce on top, then the cheese and finally extra ingredients.  No, the tomato sauce is drizzled on LAST after the cheese and any extra ingredients are put on with the fresh basil sprinkled on top  ...Finally, another masterpiece seasoned goes into the oven!\n\nWhat to order?!\nOrder what you want but if you don't come in here and order a 'plain pie' which is your basic cheese w/basil, you are missing out on life!  Oh, and a large is really not THAT large since the slices are thin.  Trust me, 2 people can definitely finish that.  \n\nCash Only, No slices- only whole pies, \u0026 No Reservations.  I was lucky to not have had to wait in that gregarious long line since I came at 5pm.  Transportation wise - 1) Either walk across the Brooklyn Bridge or 2) Take the subway and walk 5-10 minutes towards the harbor or 3) Find the oh-so-limited meter spaces around or pay $12 for some parking", "author": "Jessica C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-15", "description": "I liked the flavor of the pizza and a chance to pick my own topping, but I felt they should have their own recommended type as well.

Okay, the pizza tasted really good, maybe the crust is thinner than I'd prefer.  But the wait was too long and the place too crowded and boring to instill a desire to return.

Nothing, I tell you. I had a great experience. \n\nThe combination of herbs in the sauce and as toppings was delicious. The smoky crisp crust and underside made for a smart fold.\nThe thinly sliced mozz that spead out around the edge of the pizza made for good photos and tastiness.

Grimaldi's coal brick-oven pizza attracts lines down the block with hour-long waits. Wondering if the pizza was really worth the quoted wait, I asked the man serving up spumoni on the sidewalk for his thoughts. His response: it's all about the experience. Grimaldi's is heavily decorated, annually being recognized as of the best in the city and showing up on food shows.\n\nThe door is handled like a club, with droves of people clamoring towards the front of the line and a stocky, finger-pointing man asking how many in each party. Luckily, looks don't seal your fate... you just have to bide your time. What we noticed was that the wait to take out was much quicker. So if you're not dead-set on sitting down inside, you can always grab a pie and take it towards the promenade.\n\nThe restaurant has traditional New York Italian restaurant motif with photos of NYC-centric people and places on the walls, red and white checkered tablecloths, and the smell of tomato sauce and baking bread in the air.\n\nWe ordered a large regular pie ($14) - tomato sauce and mozzarella and a half carafe of wine ($10). The pizza was amazing; better than anything just about anywhere else... except Patsy's. Yes, despite the hype, the wait, and the taste, the crust wasn't quite as crisp, the sauce not quite the perfection of sweet and savory, and it was lacking mozzarella. However, the pizza we ordered to go and ate on a nearby bench was considerably more delicious and was \"1B\" to Patsy's \"1A\" pie.\n\nGrimaldi's has branched out with locations in New Jersey, Arizona, Texas, and Florida.\n\nAnd keep these tips in mind: No reservations. No credit cards. No slices.

This spot only has the Grimaldi's name from when Patsy sold the rights to Frank Ciolli back in 1998. Since 1998, the pizza has had no true affiliation with the Grimaldi family.\n\nAs a Brooklyn resident, I can attest to the plethora of better pizza options in the borough. One of the more notable places happens to reside at 19 Old Fulton Street, which is also the original location for Grimaldi's when Patsy owned the restaurant. Juliana's in fact has the original coal oven, making Juliana's truly the original in that it is owned and run by Patsy himself, is in the original location, and has the original oven.\n\nGrimaldi's has a tacky sign claiming they are the original Grimaldi pizza, which is no more than false advertising. Grimaldi's in essence is now a tourist trap. Works out better for me considering when the lines are always so long at Grimaldi's, I can always walk in for the authentic Patsy pizza at Juliana's with much less of a wait. \n\nAlso, Grimaldi's has terrible service, they display a tacky sign on the front door that the restaurant is \"cash only,\" and only care about quickly serving pies so they can get to the next people in line rather than focus on the quality of the service. \n\nIf you want a rushed dining experience for pizza that is not truly the original, so be it. But if you open your eyes, you can have the truly authentic Grimaldi's pie right next door at Juliana's. And chances are you will get to meet Patsy himself as he loves to greet customers and ensure a pleasurable dining experience for his clientele.
