My coworker had the pasta and shrimp and she loved it. \nService was great, we felt comfortable and taken care of. The place is clean and tidy and has indoor and outdoor seating which I love, always good to have options. Will be coming back soon.

I came here with my boyfriend at 5pm on a Saturday when my friend was working at the cafe/restaurant.\n\nIt's located in the heart of Brooklyn Heights and is in a beautiful location because it's just a short walk from the Brooklyn Promenade. The restaurant/cafe has a warm and cheerful atmosphere as there are maroon-like leather seats at the booths and majority of the seats and tables are made of sleek wood. The walls are decorate with paintings from local artists.\n\nMy friend greeted us with a warm and friendly smile and asked what would we like, gave us recommendations, and etc. We were given a bread basket and we also started off with drinks:\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Angry Orchard and I had a Watermelon Martini. The watermelon martini tasted almost like a Jolly Rancher candy in a liquid form and with alcohol in it. I have to admit it was a little strong for my taste, so unfortunately I didn't drink the whole glass.\n\nFor appetizer, we had the Warm Spinach Dip with Corn Tortillas. We typically order fried calamari as an appetizer, but this time I wanted to try something different. The dip was a delight, not too cheesy and you get spinach in every dip and bite. Chips were crunchy and fresh, definitely not stale.\n\nMy  boyfriend the Wild Mushroom Ravioli from the dinner specials menu for the evening we went. It's definitely a little more expensive than ravioli we've had in other restaurants. The wild mushroom ravioli was accompanied with an olive oil garlic sauce, sauteed shrimp,  asparagus, and cherry tomatoes. \n\nThe dish is definitely vibrant, but I didn't really see why there was a need for shrimp, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes. I would have much preferred wild mushrooms around the dish. The ravioli itself was delicious and super filling and I would have preferred more sauce.\n\nI ordered the Lobster Mac \u0026 Cheese since it sounded amazing. The lobster mac \u0026 cheese was bathed in brandy lobster cream, Parmesan, Gruyere, and cheddar cheese. I liked it for the most part, tasted more like cheese than lobster-like. \n\nI actually had trouble finishing the lobster mac and cheese because there was so much cheese and cream that I got full instantly. The cheese was just a little overwhelming.\n\nOur bill came out to be more expensive then what my boyfriend \u0026 I typically pay for when we eat out. However, I really liked the service and the attentiveness from the other servers before my friend arrived to our table. I also really like the atmosphere because most of the customers are locals, tourists, and/or family. I also like that there's a warm and welcoming atmosphere here.\n\nI think if I am in the area and in search of warm and delicious comfort food than yes and maybe if for a birthday dinner and etc. If a friend or someone asks me for a good Brooklyn Heights restaurant recommendation, Heights Cafe would definitely be on my top list of recommendations.", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-21", "description": "* (( Rating scale from lower score: A, to higher score: AAAAA ))\n\nMust eat: \nBrunch - poached eggs with Smoked salmon \u0026 poached eggs with crab cakes.\n\nTaste: AAAA\nInterior design: AAA\nClearing: AAA.\nService: AAA.\nPrice: $$\n(Tasted in June 2018)", "author": "Love F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-25", "description": "Really good location and friendly staff.

We visited the Heights for Sunday brunch promptly at 10 am, and were surprised an hour later to discover that the spot was mostly empty.  Service was fast, pleasant, and attentive, but the food and drinks were merely adequate. We ordered a latte, two Bloody Marys, the omelet special of the day, and a poached egg dish called \"The Chesapeake\". My husband's crab cakes looked dry enough to choke on, and my Bloody Marys were a watery letdown.

It's not far from subways and SO close to the Promenade. The food is pretty good -- your standard brunch fare, and the prices are decent considering the area. There are lots of TVs if you are looking for somewhere to watch sports, but it doesn't feel much like a sports bar at all. There are a few downsides, though -- they don't take brunch reservations and when I called they were not honest about the wait time.

I ordered their Bellini to drink which didn't really taste like a Bellini but it was definitely heavy on the bubbly so totally worth the price ($8). I ordered the chicken and waffle which I was initially skeptical about but it totally blew me away. The chicken breast was boneless and perfectly crispy, and the waffles were nice and fluffy, not chewy at all. They give you just the right amount of chicken to waffle, which is appreciated especially when I've had chicken with wayy too much waffle. They give you maple syrup and a bbq sauce on the side so you can dip/pour as much as you want. The maple syrup wasn't too thick and the BBQ sauce had this nice smoky flavor to it. My mom ordered the quiche, which I had a bite of and thought it was very flavorful. I was expecting the quiche to be hotter (temperature wise) when I took a bite because my chicken and waffle was very hot when I got it so I'm not sure if they have them premade and heat them up or it was just sitting on the counter while the rest of our food was being prepared. My dad and sister both got burgers that they seemed happy with.  My dad didn't like the fries because he thought they were overcooked but said the vegetables were very fresh. My sister ordered an iced latte and said it was warm and the ice had already melted when it was served. Additionally I've previously ordered their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and it was the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had, no joke.\nOverall a very enjoyable experience. The service was good and they have a lovely outside area when the weather is nice. The one thing that turned me off was there were quite a few flies buzzing around. Price wise it was reasonable. I would definitely come again.", "author": "Antonia A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-21", "description": "Tasty burger with lots of trimmings and very good omelet.

Reminded me of a high school student who did her job w the minimal amount  of expected service but who really didn't want to be there and was not really happy in making guests happy or accommodating requests.  \n\nThe A/C was too high so it was uncomfortably cold and when we asked if we could sit outside they were breaking down the tables so that wasn't an option the server said. Server did not make any suggestions for us to move or make it more comfortable.\n\nDrinks. No drink menu. I was hot and tired when I arrived (until shortly after frozen by their A/C) and realized I am not used to not having a menu to guide me in my drink choices. I asked if they had Mezcel. No. \n\nCobb salad.  When I asked if they could have something else instead of iceberg which I do not eat - said sure, and when I asked what she recommended she she likes iceberg because it is crunchy. Wait, what lettuce is not crunchy. Ok, moving along realizing she is not one to ask for suggestions so I asked if they had romaine. Yes. Done . \n\nAfter taking time I decided  on an old fashioned thinking that is a simple drink to make. Ordered and when it arrived, not good.\n\nCobb salad was served, looked good, but without dressing. \n\nCold, looking for her to ask for dressing and to add a little something to my old fashioned, she was nowhere in sight . Wait, she was in sight, gabbing away w her co worker across the room . After 5 minutes I was ready to go get her personally, she walked over to give someone else a menu and I was able to get her attention .\n\nI brought up not having dressing and asked what they typically served with their Cobb salad and she looked at my salad saying there was blue cheese dressing on it already. I nicely told her that Cobb salad came with blue cheese on it but that was not dressing and asked for a vinaigrette. \n\nI asked if she would have the bartender sweeten up the drink since I was not sure how to improve the flavor but sweet generally will make me happier. \n\nNow I'm feeling like I'm asking for the world because it's 3 things and she is not making big efforts to correct. I'm worried she will put something terrible in my drink for inconveniencing her. \n\nDrink came back, sticky sweet syrupy and even more awful. I had given up. \n\nThe positive: Cobb salad with romaine instead of iceberg was great. Fresh avocados, eggs and the right ratio of all the ingredients. \n\nWould not go back, and was more disappointed when I saw intriguing cute places a little further along the stretch, but if I lived in the area I would get a Cobb salad for takeout.", "author": "Lisa F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-06", "description": "Good bread and fries.

He did well with picking this place because I fell in love almost immediately once I saw the ambiance \u0026 genuine smiles on the fellow diner's faces. He has a thing for candles \u0026 windows. Who am I not to oblige?\n\nHeights Cafe offers a memorable experience  with the pleasant hostess, amazing food \u0026 wooden furniture. I have a thing for wood especially Cherry wood. \n\nOur waitress gave us ample amount of time to place our drinks \u0026 entr\u00e9es. We started off with a Blueberry Martini \u0026 Watermelon Martini. The drinks are strong here. Not strong in a good way either. There was no flavor whatsoever \u0026 tasted like rubbing alcohol. Flavor, where art thou?\n\nHe had the Penne Pasta which he added Chicken \u0026 Italian Sausage with fresh grated Parmesan Cheese. I had the Lobster \u0026 Shrimp Mac \u0026 Cheese with Breadcrumbs on top. It was delicious! Both entrees actually. My Mac \u0026 Cheese was piping hot I almost burned my tongue \u0026 finger trying to get to the gooeyness. \n\nThe reason for the 4/5 stars is because the waitress brought the check back requesting more money. I thought that was terrible \u0026 tacky. Let me just put it out there that he's not a bad tipper. \n\nShe said, \"it's a 15% tip\". Not that it was suggested on the receipt but how dare you come back for more money. We are firm believers that your tip reflects your service. Why should you get 15% if your service was less than?
