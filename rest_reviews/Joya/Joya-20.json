It seems as if they began using cheaper ingredients. I use to love going here and now i realize why I stopped. The entree I ordered wasn't flavorful, nor did it have much texture. This time when I was there, the air conditioner was broken and it was extremely hot inside, on a day that it was 85 degrees outside. I recall telling some friends they should definitely give this restaurant a try, but now I'd feel guilty if I recommended it to someone. Unfortunately this restaurant fell off big time ! \nNot much parking in the narrow streets around there, but there's always an empty spot by a parking meter nearby.", "author": "Simon R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-19", "description": "Took the 5 to Borough Hall and took a charming walk on a snowy Saturday night through Brooklyn. \u00a0Walk in and was not sure what to expect, it was just the closest place I could get curry so I went!! My favorite thing about the place was the atmosphere! It was dark so it felt like a scene out of a romantic comedy where the couple might not be the first date, but the second, where the couple starts to fall for each other. \u00a0The art was modern but not gaudy, and the kitchen was open so you could see the flames. It made me feel like I was just invited into a home for dinner. I thought of the style in Joya as the simple black dress girls who wear red lipstick; not flashy but subtly stunning. \n\nIt took me a couple minutes to get seated because of people doing take out orders, I was okay with it. Once seated, I was not sure what type of curry to get so the waiter guided me through the red vs green, I chose the KANG KOONG because I did not want to regret the decision the following morning. \u00a0I got it with the shrimp and the food came out within 10 minutes. One thing I thought was interesting was that the drink menu was written on with a pen! The \u00a0person who wrote it had nice handwriting but just something I did not expect.\n\nCurry: The flavors were great. It got me hooked on Curry again because the way coconut milk interacts with the spice, it soothes the soul and my throat. \u00a0I thought the veggies were sauteed to a nice temp so they did not overwhelm my mouth but just helped to soak up the curry. \u00a0I continued to add my rice onto it but I should've asked for more. \u00a0The waitstaff did not interact with me besides for taking my order, refilling my water once and to give/receive the bill from me. \u00a0I wish I would've gotten a little more interaction but it was fine, the food and whole atmosphere made up for it. \u00a0\n\nOverall: Exceptional environment + above-average curry + okay waitstaff = I'll be back :)", "author": "Jerrius J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-28", "description": "Came in on a beautiful Saturday spring afternoon and we chose to sit in the patio outside.\nWe ordered the thai iced tea, spicy noodles and spicy fried rice with chicken and pineapple. \nThai iced tea was standard, the spicy noodles was fine 4/5. \nThe one which was just pathetic was the fried rice my husband ordered. They literally served us some old rice, which had not even stir fried well. There were blobs of white rice (obviously hastily fried rice) and the quality of the rice was old. We sent it back showing that the \"Fried rice\" was not cooked, and they came back with a similar looking rice which seemed a little better compared to the one served initially!\nWaste of time and money.

Everything on this menu is delicious and it's made with love and TONS of flavor.\n\nI've been coming here since 2008 and it never ceases to amaze me how delicious the food is. The price is very reasonable, especially considering the other food choices you have in the area.\n\nStaff is friendly and helpful and your food comes out in a timely fashion. Not sure if they take reservations, but there are usually seats available. In the off chance there aren't, you shouldn't have to wait more than 20 or 30 minutes max.\n\nOrder the tiger shrimp appetizer - highly recommended!", "author": "Naomi Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-29", "description": "Joya is my favorite restaurant. When I lived in the neighborhood, I used to order in all the time because their food is SO good and so reasonably priced. Once I moved out of the 'hood - I started going back all the time. My partner and I went there on our 3rd date and then returned every month for a year on our \"month-a-versary\" (yes, i know). The night we got engaged, my (now) fiance had all of our closest friends and family gather at Joya to surprise me. The staff was incredible and as always, the food was SO delicious and their wine pours are no JOKE!

My bf immediately was like ugh, it's Saturday night it's going to be packed. I say eh, you never know it's been years. We go and lo and behold no line, no wait, good amount of people in the restaurant but not packed. \n\nThe decor is updated and more brightly lit than I remember it being previously. There is also a very nice backyard space. We ate outside it was lovely. We enjoyed our meals here as usual and the drinks were good. Staff was very attentive and food came out quickly.", "author": "Ayesha A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-29", "description": "Joya, I enjoyed ya.\n\nThis neighborhood itself has so many edgy.. modern.. even whimsical kind of spots to dine in, and despite that Joya is able to shine through. Upon arrival its almost late night club feeling before you meet the outside courtyard for eating and hanging out in the back. This place would be excellent for a date, night out with friends, but children should be left at home, let the adults roam free!\n\nAnyway, we started with the calamari and the barbeque wings, and if you follow my reviews, you know asian wings arent my favorite -but I have found them. The perfect mix of your traditional fried chicken wing in a honey sauce with asian flair. My father in law's favorite, my wife dislikes them(shes more of a Wangs and Bonchon type wing), and I had to take his side on this one. \n\nMy plate here was my favorite, did not stray far from what im used to, they have an excellent red curry sauce where the coconut really gets to shine. My wife had the green curry, which is not my typical choice, but her shrimp was not cleaned properly as the vein had remained in her shrimp. The steak and shrimp fried rice plate stole the show at the table presentation wise, the portion size is for two, has to be. And if youre afraid of trying new things and go for the pad thai -gotcha, thats super packed with flavor too.\n\nDespite the shrimp incident and a plate incident we had, I did enjoy myself and enjoy the food. The decor, the food, it all comes together nicely.\n\nAll in all very much enjoyed this experience and can see why its one of my mother in laws favorite places to eat.

I then asked if they could turn down the volume of the music because we were with a very small baby. The manager was not happy about it, he turned the volume down just a little, the music was still super high for a baby. They were only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant so I didn't understand why he wouldn't turn it down a little more ... \n\nThe waitress was rushing us to order. She asked us to take off our plates while she was bringing the meals ... she wouldn't even come to our table when we asked for another drink. \n\nAnyway not a great experience.

I went with a friend yesterday for lunch and it was the perfect day to sit outside on the patio and dine al fresco. The breeze light breeze was welcomed and the patio and is covered with enough shade from nature. The restaurant and patio are modernly and comfortably decorated. The service was quick but not to where you would feel rushed, but for lunch it's especially important to have attentive and effective service pacing. My friend and I shared the small fried calamari to start and it was on point, served with a sweet and spicy chili dipping sauce. I ordered off the lunch menu so also received a papaya salad with peanuts in a yummy and slightly tangy lime vinaigrette dressing which I also shared. I ordered pad Thai with shrimp and my meal and the salad was a lunch special for $10.95. Yes, you read that correctly. $10.95 for an ample sized salad and entree. The pad Thai was one of the best I've had in a long time and there was a generous portion of small shrimp. My friend ordered pad see ew with beef and it looked amazing. Since he's Cambodian, he put a ton of spicy chili paste on it before I I asked to try it and didn't want to ruin my palate for the pad Thai but he raves about it. The water was filled without us having to ask and the bill was presented and collected in a quick manner since she knew we had to return to work. Yuck.

My boyfriend convinced me to try this place as they have amazing reviews as well. Upon arrival, I was super excited to see that they have outdoor seating in the backyard. It was well set up, and the waiter was super attentive and friendly. They give u two menus, one printed and one hand written ( which was quite difficult to read as I see many other Yelp reviewers say the same thing) \n\nWe ordered the spicy flat noodles (which is the dish I MUST always get- but other places called this dish drunken noodle) and from the special menu- we ordered the fried catfish with Chinese broccoli and the BBQ chicken wings. \n\nThe wings came out first, my first impression was that it was over fried. It wasn't that golden crispy color, but instead a dark brown color. The flavor was there, even though they call it BBQ there's hints of curry as well. \n\nThen came the entrees- the catfish dish was pretty good but the thing that bothered me was their produce is not fresh. I was picking through the Chinese broccoli as all I find is black and yellow spots on the veggies which is sign of the veggies going bad. \n\nThe spicy flat noodle was definitely no where near what I expected. If you eat flat noodles a lot, you know it's not good when the flat noodles are all glued together as big lumps where sauce can't even get to. There was no bounce to the noodles and super greasy as well. They also serve it with a lemon which I have never seen before. We put some on to see if it taste better but it ruins the dish even more.
