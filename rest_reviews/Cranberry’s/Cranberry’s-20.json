Everything is great, haven't tried anything I didnt like. I especially love the chocolate croissant and other choc pastries. It also helps that everyone who works there are nice - always with a smile on their faces (or a joke or two). They actually enjoy what they're doing which is quite a rarity nowadays in New York.

Dark, dingy interior with no room to sit. \nThe drink options are sparse despite the large fridge and the deli case is awkward.

The scones are a personal favorite, whether with chocolate chips, blueberries, raspberries or other yummy things. The corn muffins could become habit-forming, as they also come in versions featuring those aforementioned berries baked inside. The coffee cake muffins seem popular with coffee drinkers, although I am not as big a fan of them, personally. One of the other nice touches to this shop: By the time the breakfast shift is in full swing, you can also get lunch items for a very efficient one-two punch. Goodbye, hunger!

Brooklyn need more places that makes good coffee, and Cranberry's is one of them. But I think that some of the dishes are little overpriced. But I am not here to decide for people how to price their products, or for customers to decide how much to spend.

The folks behind the counter were quick with my coffee (which was quite reasonably priced for NYC), and then, thus armed, I took to the creaky wooden bench fronting the shop, where I sipped my brew and lazily watched west-side Brooklyn stream past - lovely! I even made a friend while there, with a charming older lady who shared my bench and some kind words.\n\nMy time at Cranberry's was a good one, and has become a good memory. So, thanks to everyone who runs the place, for providing me this priceless experience :-)", "author": "Chris S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-08", "description": "Too hyped on yelp!\n\nNow, I trust Yelp a lot and am constantly on it, but I was fairly disappointed of the rave reviews of this coffee shop.  Like the two stars state, I've experienced better.  I was a little thrown off, as this joint is more of a grab-and-go place rather than an actual bakery/coffeeshop.  There's not a whole lot of choices of desserts and drinks.  And, the items themselves seemed a little overpriced for the actual value and size.\n\nI got the chai tea iced latte after a full 10 minutes of debating what drink and/or snack to get.  It seemed like the safest decision that I wouldn't mind spending a few dollars on.  The chai was a little too sweet and tasted a lot like chai syrup rather than a latte.  Even having nonfat milk make the chai really strong.  I usually don't mind strong chai (I love Starbuck's strong chai), but this one was a little too overbearing.\n\nThe sandwiches were the only food items that seemed decent, but they just didn't look too fresh.  I was fairly disappointed by the place and sort of wished I had just gone to a local Starbucks.\n\nOne thing, I really loved the staff and atmosphere.  Locals seemed to be regulars here, and the locations is adorable-near a small park right outside.\n\nBut, really, save yourself a visit and try some other places!\n\n37/100", "author": "Kim H."}], "servesCuisine": "Sandwiches", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Cranberry\u2019s", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "48 Henry St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MmEWtgBP5w9RYVbiVUprVA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17186243500"}
