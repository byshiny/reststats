Women and monorities especially... take the time to read the below incident and question where to spend your hard earned money in your own backyard!\n\nNational\n723 Fulton St\nFort Greene\nBrooklyn, NY 11217\n(718) 522-3510\n\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/national-brooklyn-2?uid=KKsfh-y9xMhpsn2uRxnULA\u0026utm_source=ashare\u0026ref=yelp-android\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/National-Thai-Restaurant/159902934033359\nNational, National, National... and yes, they are connected with Joya-- so BOTH establishments are deserving of fire, brimstone and non-patronage if their despicable owner finds it apropos to speak to ANY customer, especially a female in such a threatening and caustic manner. In the wake of Trump's nomination, I feel like the closeted racists have all taken a sip from a cup of hate-- now drunk on power, privilege and presenting as if tolerance of others is now 'optional'. It surely is not! \n\nTo threaten to call the cops on you when said owner took your order, failed to inform you that food service was interrupted until dinner, refused to apologize for the inconvenience  (and remedy the matter by providing you with your food... which should have been comped for the \"hullabaloo\") and then had the UNIMITIGATED GALL to scream obscenities to you, eject you from the restaurant and threaten to call the police amidst his err of personal judgement is UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nAbsolutely despicable, revolting and beyond unacceptable! This is gentrification and white privilege at its absolute finest...\n\nTo be nestled in an iconic neighborhood that is notable for the great work of minority trailblazers (he is quite lucky Spike Lee didn't leave his production studio mere blocks away and witness this owner's visceral hatred)! To encounter this behavior from a commercial owner is a travesty... he who benefits from the diverse groups of supporters and conduits of the arts and athletic revenue (BAM, Barclays Center) on a day to day basis feels it is just to speak to a professional, astute, strong Black woman  as if she is not deserving of respect and/or courtesy for an order of gentrified Thai Noodles \u0026 Beef!?!?!?! \n\nNot on my watch. \n\nI have been patroning this establishment for over 5 years. I will never, ever step foot into it again! \n\nIt's time to respect ourselves and our hard-earned money. I'm never one to beg for someone else to be in my pockets while treating me less than!!!!!!!!

I'm so tired of hearing about continual adverse treatment of my brothers and sisters in our own neighborhoods' varied establishments where customer service should be paramount! \n\n#boycottNationalThaiResturant", "author": "Maria K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-21", "description": "My dish was very tasty.

Very creative and versatile. Thai meets Europe even in some dishes. \nOH My Heavenly goodness, this was Devine, for this price I have not eaten so well and so good. I had the Panang Curry chicken and it was very good, fresh and not at all greasy or not too strongly flavored. My new favorite NY Thai place. With also very friendly service. Way worth your visit.

Pretty sure they forgot our corn on the cob appetizer, and after almost half an hour of us staring hungrily at everyone else being served (people who had been seated after us), I saw our waiter peep over at our empty table and then run panicked into the kitchen... they forgot us. \n\nThey brought out our corn, but not our other appetizer dish.  It was a long amount of time in between as well until our entrees (and appetizer noodle dish) came out... One slip up I can absolutely forgive, however we had ordered a vegetarian noodle dish and found chicken at the bottom of the plate. Being a vegetarian- I was very upset that I had potentially been eating chicken remnants from someone else's meal that had been left in the skillet. They also forgot to bring brown rice as I had ordered it, and never even offered to refill our drinks. \n\nWhile the food was the great quality we expect from Joya, the service was so subpar, we will not be going back. Food is five star, but service is far from it.", "author": "Angelique L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-18", "description": "Attitude is fuck up here\nDon't understand their Thai English so I ask couple questions and she start to get annoy\nRemember I am the customer ok?", "author": "Mary J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-29", "description": "Absolute favorite Thai restaurant hands down.

They're a great Brooklyn band with a fresh sound and tight percussio--- oh wait, I'm not reviewing the band, am I?\n\nSo I'm reviewing National, the Fort Greene sister of Song and Joya. Let me just say that service here is quick. Almost too quick. They turn tables around like nobody's business (I guess it's their business), so don't be alarmed if there's a wait at the door (doubly so if you're a small party).\n\nFood is cheap cheap cheap, but also good good good. Noodle and rice dishes start around $8 and beers are $4 a bottle. Not bad at all, considering it's cash only.\n\nI had the seafood and mussels in red curry over noodles. It came with tail-on shrimp, calamari and some veggies. The red curry was surprisingly (and delightfully) spicy. It wasn't a particularly well-balanced meal, but I liked it nonetheless.\n\nKitchen service is super quick. We skipped appetizers because we were in a rush, and we were able to finish our meal in less than half an hour, which is amazing. We didn't even have to rush while eating because the food came so quickly. I liken Thai food to Mexican food in that most of the dishes are the same ingredients; you just have to know how to put them together. And National knows how to put them together!\n\nGive em a try sometime!", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-22", "description": "Wow ! This spot has consistently .... over the years, displayed the absolutely worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant.  I stopped going here 2 years ago because of the rude treatment / service. I recently started going back, because I wanted to see if there was a change in management and servers. Nope. Some of the same crappy staff ( some new staff members), and the same poor service. \n\nOverall, the food is pretty good, but I just can't get past the terrible service.

I know good Asian food, Thai food is one of my favorites  (close to Cambodian/Kymer food).  So I got the seafood noodle soup which was AMAZING the first time I went in.  So I went back yesterday right before the 2hr. Siesta/kitchen closing time at 3pm (ummm yeah, I didn't know about that either) and they were okay to take a to go order (there was someone there who had just got their food with a wild little kid).  Maybe it was the dry, nonchalant, pretentious attitude of the counter people when I approached with a smile and a question about lunch specials or the response when i took out my debit card.  Which ever it was, I'm not too sure but a star was lost.....  next, I'm told that they only take cash.  No options, I had to ask where the nearest atm was.  Next door and a pointing finger was the response.  So I went to a seedy freestanding machine that I'm afraid might have sold my info somewhere far far away.  I come back to pay, again still smiling because they are handling my food.  What did I get? Blank stare, my change on the counter, and a cool walk away from the counter. Not even a nudge of the bag towards me or a thank you.  Whatever,  I'm hungry, so I shake my head and walk down the block to work. \n I open the bag, noodles separate, check.  Soup broth smelling delicious, check.  Chopsticks and spoon, check.  Shrimp and calamari fresh and cooked proper, negative.  The seafood smelled super fishy and was like crustacean jerky!  Plus the shrimps are now like half the size than before.  That was the final straw.... i will not be returning, I was so irritated I forgot to get tea.  \nOh well, no more nouveau, millineal faux, Spice wannabes for me.  I found a real Thai place in Queens (Thailand Kitchen) who has gained a new customer with their polite demeanor and delicious Thai tea.
