Surprisingly I thought the pizza was every so slightly not as good as the one in Tucson. It's a very different atmosphere though. There's a very long line outside and then the inside is very cramped (not surprising) and it's a bit more rushed and chaotic (also not surprising). Overall, it's not bad but I would still prefer to just get some of the super cheap, quick pizza available in New York.", "author": "Sara S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-26", "description": "Best authentic Italian pizza I've eaten outside of Italy.  Lombardi's is close second but I didn't think there crust was as soft.  Grimaldi's starts with a thin layer of pizza dough, layers it with fresh slices of mozzarella (not shredded), next the toppings (which are usually $2 a piece) then tops it with a sprinkle of fresh basil leaves and a small amount of sauce before popping it into the brick oven.  I think the large cheese pizza was $14 then $2 for each additional topping.  It won't fill up four hungry people, but keep room in your belly for Jaques Torres' chocolate shop around the corner.\n\nService was excellent!  We went at 1pm on a rainy day and there was no line, but I've heard the line can be VERY long at times.

I recommend either sticking to plain cheese (the cheese is delicious) or getting one topping, two max. my only criticism is that the pies seem slightly undercooked. I like a reasonably firm crust, and I think in an effort to turn tables they take them out a tad too soon. hence the warning to limit toppings...otherwise it turns into a heavy and slightly limp mess. all in all it's really good (probably the best pizza I've had in new york), but I have to be honest and say that I've had better pizza at home (texas)...which is pretty sad considering this is the pizza capital of the states (no thank you chicago deep dish).\n\nI'm eager to venture over to lucali's and difara to see how they stack up.", "author": "Caroline N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-05", "description": "OVERRATED ! I have been passed this place millions of times and always said \"hmm, what's the line about \"? Well , this Friday I found out and let's just say I should have saved my time and Weight Watchers points LOL. The restaurant is PACKED and I mean PACKED , there is barely enough room for you to eat comfortably . We got our pizza and it was the wrong size \u0026 the wrong toppings . Ok, we sent it back and with no apology the waiter throws our pie on the table. At this point I was ready to walk out !!! So after a few bites of this so so pizza I realized we wasted our time .

Apparently the owner was doing the seating and sat my party of 5 people in a 4 person seating area.  No elbow room.  The tables are back to back and you are like sardines in a sardine can, then we ask the gentleman to sit as another area better for our 5 person party, he refused and told us if we dont like it to leave.

The cheese used is nothing spectacular, just above average, the sauce again above average, the crust isn't even all that good. The toppings, also above average, but nothing stands out. I suspect this place is frequented by people who don't know what a real pizza is, they're used to franchise type pizza and this is basically that Pizza Hut type of pizza, but not mass produced. \n\nSorry, the beat up worn out interior to make the place look like an authentic pizzeria won't make the pizza come out authentic guys, it's cute they leave the place a bit worn and dated looking, it adds character to the place, too bad that it doesn't add any authenticity and taste to the pizza, all just for show and a fraud.\n\nPizza is made like this in most Southern Euro countries, and in most places there tastes a lot better than Grimaldi's.\n\nThis is good pizza to those wanna be hickster type non-New Yorkers, who get mad too when you point this pizza is just ok, to the uncultured know it all hickster mid-west transplants it's the Mecca of pizzerias, to someone who knows pizza, it's ok, fun once in a blue moon or when you're in the area and have no other food options or you're a hickster trying to impress people that you know the \"best\" pizza spot in NYC, and they're from out of state and don't know what a good slice of pizza is.", "author": "John L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-04-13", "description": "I really envy the owner of this place, he has got the best scam in the city going.  If you are from NYC do not go to this place.  Any neighborhood pizza place is a lot better than this.

It's notable for using crushed tomatoes instead of sauce and nice medallions of mozzarella cheese, but neither really stands out as particularly special as far as gourmet-style pizza goes.  The tomato flavor was on the waterier side, and somewhat bitter.  The crust was good, thin and a bit sweet; however my piece was a little too charred on the bottom, and my jaws got a work out from the chewiness.\n\nHonestly, if I hadn't gone at 11:30am on a workday when there was no line, I would have had to rate it 2 stars.  The pizza wasn't memorable - I'd much rather have Lucali's or My Little.

We walked in and a nice younger gentleman was about to sit us when an older gentleman told us to follow him, he walked us outside without saying a word and walked back inside.  I guess that was his way of telling us to wait outside.  We found him to be quite rude, we understand they do great business but customer service should still be a priority.

The piszza is great. But this place is a bit too touristy for me. If I'm with a group too big for Totonnos or if we're heading out on the town, I'd go here.

At 9pm on a Sunday we expected quick, awesome pizza.  Unfortunately, the service was anything but quick, making out experience anything but awesome.  After waiting an unconscionable 40 minutes for a table (when the line was just 8 deep), we were roundly ignored for 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, there was more than adequate space to seat my party and many others waiting in line, but because of their seating policies/ineptitude, nearly a dozen of us were kept waiting outside while the space sat vacant inside.  Service was non-existent.  I was grateful for the carafe of water they brought us, because hadn't that been delivered, we'd never get a refill again. Pizza was nearly launched at our table, as was the check.  And when we were within 30 minutes of closing time, the music was cut off and the air conditioning was blasted.\n\nA potentially great experience with the parents that was dampened by the Grimaldi's staff.\n\nThanks for giving me a reason to Yelp again.", "author": "Andrew U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-03", "description": "I heard about this place from a doctor I work with who grew up in NYC.  So I figured this pizza had to be truly delish. My friend and I made our way under the bridge, following the smell all along.  The night was cold and snowy which made it twice as shocking to see that there was a line you would expect for a club. We ended up waiting for an hour.  While in line, it was quite entertaining to watch the old man (I am assuming to be the owner or manager) come in and out of the door to call out who could enter the place.  He reminded me of the soup nazi from Seinfeld because he was very serious and particular about the order of the line and the exact amount of people who could enter the building.  I was almost scared he would shake his head at me and scream, \"No pizza for you!\" (He ended up being very sweet). \n   When we finally made it to our table, we were shoulder to shoulder with every other person in the tiny room.  The menu was also small and to the point. I have to say, it was amazing how quick the pizza landed.... \n   Sadly, I can't say the pizza was amazing but it did taste fresh and authentic.  The crust was crispy thin and had the flavor from the coals that they use in their brick oven.  I did like that they used fresh mozzarella and basil. The sauce was good but not great.  \n   If I were ranking the experience, this place would get a 4 but the pizza was not as exciting.", "author": "amanda p."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-19", "description": "Do not wait two hours here for some authentic new york pizza!

We ordered a medium pie, the cheese was ok, and there was barely any sauce. Honestly the whole pie had almost little to no flavor. I had dollar pizza better than this crap. But don't get me wrong maybe with some toppings and extra sauce it can go up a star. My friend asked for waters first then soda. The guy gave us the sodas first and we were done quite quickly. We had to ask three times for water, what incompetent and slow waiters.
