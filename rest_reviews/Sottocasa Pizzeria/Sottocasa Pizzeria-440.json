The beer offering is one extreme or the other \"artisan\" at $15! or the nondescript at $6. The salads are nice. The stone oven must be very hot and hard  to drive. I wish someone including myself had looked at the bottom of my pizza before I started eating it. It was burnt. It looked good, but wasn't. I don't think they should try and pass that on to their customer. Inspect before you eat.

Pizza is enough for one so get a few and share some different flavors. The salsiccia (hot Italian sausage) was very good but the tartufata was by far the best pizza on the menu and probably one of the best I have ever had. Please do not forget the Nutella pizza! Very delicious!! Thumbs up for sure!", "author": "Tania C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-28", "description": "The ambiance was pleasant enough and the service was speedy and friendly. The appetizer salads -spinaci and rughetta - were tasty and clearly made with fresh ingredients - the ricotta was creamy and tasted homemade. However, the pizzas themselves - the white autunno and the red verdure - were somewhat of a disappointment for an establishment that purports to be an authentic italian pizzeria. The crust was quite doughy and the combination of toppings was not particularly complementary. Not like eating in Naples, that's for sure!", "author": "Nick T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-11", "description": "Just a few words to say that if you want to come and taste the REAL pizza napoletana this is the place for you: all fresh ingredients with no exception.

With that being the case, why choose 2nd tier?", "author": "Matthew P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-16", "description": "Both of our pizzas were soaking wet, top and crust. Could and did, to extent possible, ring them out like a wet towel. Sound appetizing? Waiter never checked in, or asked how it was. Sad to have a restaurant when you just don't care about the food you serve.", "author": "Ken S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-03-02", "description": "I am shaking my head wondering how this place rates 5 stars or anywhere near it. Went there today with my daughter and it was a terrible experience.\n\n1. The place wasn't terribly crowded when we got there but it quickly filled up after we were seated. We ordered focaccia as an appetizer. Focaccia is usually a soft, pillowy specially seasoned bread that one sinks one's teeth into. Instead we were served a flat, partially burnt slab of thin bread that TASTED like focaccia but was hard and crunchy. Hmmm.\n\n2. As the room filled up, we began to see that tables to both the right and left of us had been served while our order was nowhere in sight. FINALLY, the waiter came over and said something like, \"It will be just a few more minutes\"... but didn't seem particularly apologetic about it.  After SEVERAL minutes, my daughter's pizza came but mine did not.  It took several MORE minutes before my order came out. Mind you, we ordered off of the menu, nothing particularly complicated or specially ordered.\n\n3. The pizza had a nice flavor but the top was burnt just like the focaccia was. I ordered a spinach ricotta pizza which was a disaster. They had scattered some raw spinach leaves on the top which obviously got burned under the flames of their oven. All I smelled was burnt spinach when the pizza came and that's exactly what it tasted like. My daughter had a pizza with fresh cherry tomatoes on it; it was tasty but the sauce was drippy and the crust eventually became pretty soggy.\n\n4. Other than a variety of wines, they serve soft drinks (from very SMALL bottles) but no iced tea. Hello?  There are people who don't care for carbonated beverages and it might be a bit early in the day for alcoholic beverages. Please think about adding iced tea or lemonade to the menu.\n\nI noticed that the pizza ordered by the woman at the next table was also burnt on top. It seems to me that Sotto's oven is either too hot or they are cooking the pizzas incorrectly. They are obviously way too close to the flame and should be moved downward by at least an inch, I'd say.\n\nThe atmosphere is fairly cozy (although noisy, lots of hard surfaces) and well decorated but a hipster vibe is not nearly enough to make up for such shoddy service and lousy food. If you're going to charge $15 for a pizza, it ought to be GREAT.  Will not likely visit this restaurant again nor would I recommend it.  This is Brooklyn; there are tons of places in the borough that make better Neapolitan pizza for a lot less money.", "author": "Lee W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-07", "description": "Decor:  4/5\n-Diana C and I came on a rainy day, luckily there was no wait and a few empty tables\n-There is a bar with a few seats\n-Ambiance is slightly dim\n\nService: 5/5\n-friendly and patient\n-we told our server the pizza was bland and not tasty.

This place has a very warm and romantic ambiance.The tables are set up in a way where everyone is kind of sitting together as all the tables are side by side.

We have eaten at many of the highly rated Neopolitan pizza restaurants in Manhattan \u0026 Brooklyn and this rates up there with the best.  \n\nWe have gone four times now within the past two months and have never been disappointed.  On our separate visits we have ordered the Margherita, Quattro Stagione,the Laura and the Parmigiana pizzas for our table, in addition to their salads\n\nWith regards to the main attraction, i.e., the pizzas, they are the real deal.  All the ingredients are fresh, the crust is fantastic, it is cooked to perfection.  The aroma of the hot pizza itself when it is delivered to the table straight from the oven is fabulous.  \n\nSo, yes, I love this place.  The atmosphere is wonderful, the decor is tasteful with whimsical touches.  The service is friendly, welcoming and just delightful.  \n\nOne reviewer posted that the restaurant is in the basement.
