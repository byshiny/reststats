It's a no fuss place - simple menu.\n\nOrdered a large pie and it was served quickly.  Light, airy dough, just enough sauce and toppings.

As embarrassing as it was to write that sentence, I was even more embarrassed when I took my first bite of the delicious pizza! \n\nSince they switched locations, there is ample seating space and plenty of classic booths for you to take advantage of.

They hoped I would have a better experience in the main branch in Brooklyn.  Not being a great fan of outside-Manhattan boroughs, I went for the sake of good food.  \n\nNeedless to say, I was greatly disappointed.  I went with friends for dinner.  The place was half empty and we were given a table on the 2nd floor.  Customer Service was pretty okay.  Waiters came when we signaled and they gave us what we wanted. \n\nThe most unsatisfying part was the pizza.  I don't understand what's so great about their pizza.  Nothing is good about it.  Our pizza came soggy, which is not something I like since I can't roll up the pizza and eat it without getting my fingers wet.  \n\nI suggest Lombardi would be a better option.", "author": "Kei Ling W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-28", "description": "I had some family that came from Canada and they wanted to try out this place.\nWe came around 9:30pm when the lines died down.

However, the few slices that did have basil on it was good.\nWe actually ordered 3 different pies of disappointment.

They have moved into a bigger location right down the street, which helps the wait time in line, but like I said, I wouldn't wait longer than 10-15mins max for this pizza.

We were told it would be a half an hour wait (just a ploy to get us to stay ONE AND A HALF HOURS) in line in the freezing cold. Then we get in there and have to wait ages for our pizzas which came out BURNT!!! Yes BURNT! But we were SO hungry we ate it anyway. Obviously after that long of a wait you need the bathroom by the time you get there... NO toilet paper in the women's toilets and the manager didn't care one bit when I told him. And then.... oh yes it gets much worse... their FOOD HYGIENE is NON EXISTENT!!!!  I watched while the pizza chef put raw sausage meat on the pizza then wiped his hands on his dirty apron and then picked up fresh tomatoes and cheese and THEN answered a call on his cell phone and NEVER washed his hands once. DISGUSTING!!! And then lastly the bill... two large and one medium pizza and three soft drinks and it was almost $90!!!!

Chris, the gregarious bartender / host / waiter is hilarious and very accommodating. \n\n***Tip*** If you don't want to wait an hour in line for a table. (Not kidding about the wait either) then see if there is room at the bar to sit.

I love businesses that are basically a tourist attraction. I love it even more when they are actually awesome!\n\nParents were in town and they wanted to try it out - I guess they have been on TV before? Grimaldi's, not my parents. So they wanted to try it - As did I. \n\nSo being a proper yelper I educated myself before coming. I wanted to know what to expect. Long lines? Ok no big deal. Borderline shotty service. Ok, as long as the Pizza is good. \n\nWe got there and waited 20 or so minutes which wasn't that bad at all - Got seated and waited longer for a waiter to take our order. I kind of expected that. \n\nto the point - You will wait in a long line  - You will probably have shitty service - The Pizza is good. \n\nA note to Grimaldi's management and ownership. I know you're Grimaldi's and you can basically treat people like they are waiting at the DMV. But if you have the opportunity to make the best possible, well rounded experience to people that are looking for that great neighborhood pizza place that everyone wants to come to...then do it. HAVE GREAT SERVICE. \n\nPlease fix your busted ass menu. Its 2013 and your website across the top is broken up. If you are reading this. I will do it for free. \n\nWell - Maybe all that is the charm of the place. \n\n4 Stars because I will come back and will suggest it. Only for people that need a place to eat while they are walking around Dumbo. \n\nI'm just being a negative Nancy...I guess it wasn't all that bad.", "author": "Kevin F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-04", "description": "On my trip to NYC I decided to have dinner with family at Grimaldi's after visiting the Brooklyn bridge.   And boy was the line super long and out the door down the block.  This must say something about the pizza if people are willing to wait in a line that long. Luckily the line moved at a steady rate and we were able to sit at the bar since we were only a party of 2.  Con- their liquor license is pending.  Other than that our pizza tasted amazing despite the kitchen running out of grilled chicken.  We had pepperoni, ham, basil, ricotta, and mozzarella cheese.   All fresh and piping hot when served at our table. Grimaldi's is my all time favorite pizza place.", "author": "Francis P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-23", "description": "All I could say is if your lookin for pizza in Brooklyn I recommend this place. It's a tourist spot for people craving for NY pizza! Expect long lines and long wait time they also take long cooking your pizza because it's cooked old style brick and coal. But it's worth it for the experience. When you walk inside it's smells like coal mixed with pizza smell it's not that typical smell you would get from other pizza places. The servers are all happy dancing to the beat of whatever music there playing 80's type of music. The desert was so good especially the cannoli.

Sure, there were good things: the large pizza I had was HUGE, probably approaching 18 inches in diameter. And the people there, both the staff and fellow diners, were really friendly and talktative. \n\nBut I found the pizza below-par. The base didn't seem to be fully cooked and the toppings okay but underwhelming. There was also the wait: although I was shown to a table immediately, the pizza took 30 minutes to arrive, much longer than I'm used to. Further, at close to $28 for pizza, two toppings and tip, I'd say the value was questionable, even despite the pizza's size. \n\nSo my quest for the legendary NY pizza continues. I've already had better pizza (with crispy yet light bases and fresher toppings) elsewhere in Brooklyn, so my optimism is undimmed. Grimaldi's however I found to be okay but not spectacular.", "author": "Peter S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-03-23", "description": "Worst service. Sat near the entrance and heard a old guy(probably the owner) called these customers that came in \"stupid f***\" behind their back. That was very rude and disrespectful. Overated pizza. Ordered a small pizza with chicken and mushroom and barely tasted the chicken. Burnt crust and soggy pizza overall. What was worst was the cash only policy. Went over to the ATM and charged me $5 for ATM fee. That is ridicolous and was not worth it. Never coming back again.", "author": "Joong S.

The wait wasn't as long as I thought it would be. It was a rainy weekday and we had to wait in a line outside the restaurant. It was weird when we got inside and there were all these empty tables. The staff were pretty attentive and helpful in recommending what to eat/toppings. However, it wasn't as mind-blowing as I expected it to be.

The wait outside is stupid, the cash only policy is a pain in the butt, the no-fountain soft drinks is annoying....but this place is always crowded for one reason only.  The pizza is ridiculously good.\n\nI've been trying to find another pizza joint that has better tasting sauce-crust combination and just haven't been able to find it.  If you're near the brooklyn bridge in future, check this place out.  Put up with the wait, it's worth it.  In my hometown, people wait two hours to eat at Outback Steakhouse.

Ordered the plain cheese/basil/tomato pizza for my friend and I to share and it was literally out in 5 minutes, maybe even less.  I think that the word 'perfection' was invented after someone took a bite of this pizza.

We were seated right away (upstairs) and had our drink and food order taken as we were famished. It took about five minutes to receive our drinks. As we\nanxiously waited for our famous pizza, guests started trickling in and a line started forming outside. We noticed some tables  that were seated after us were getting their food orders and brushed it off... We noticed everyone was getting their pizza except for us. Forty minutes later we asked our server the status on our pizza and finally received it. No apology, just the pizza. The pizza was good, but not the best I've had. I would return to Grimaldi's, but I wouldn't go out of my way for their pizza.", "author": "Chiyon Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-09", "description": "Situated under the Brooklyn Bridge and touted as the #1 Pizzaria in the entire city, I knew that I had to give this famous New York staple a try. My friends and I were actually so excited about trying it that we decided to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge from Battery Park to get there. Once on the Brooklyn side, it was a little bit tricky to track the restaurant down on foot. However, after a time, we finally found it and noticed the relatively long line waiting to get their hands (and mouths) around a slice of Grimaldi's famous pizza. We were only a small party of 3, but it took about 45 minutes to finally be seated. 45 minutes may have seemed a long time to wait, but our gruff, no-nonsense host commented that it is usually a longer wait so we were thankful to finally be inside and seated, out of the wind and cold.\n\nThis place was packed, with tiny tables that could accomodate only maybe half of a 4 person party. However, I suppose beggers can't be choosy. However, when a group of 3 Japanese girls were seated next to us at a 2-top they tried their best to squeeze in but couldn't manage to comfortably sit around the table. When they asked the host if they could move, he barked \"SIT DOWN OR GET OUT\". I was shocked to see a restaurant, especially one of Grimaldi's fame, could possibly treat their customers this way and still be in business. But as the case may be, they simply didn't care. There would always be people who would be happy to take those seats and sit down for dinner. It's a sad reality but there was simply no incentive for the restaurant to treat their customers amicably.\n\nWe decided to order 2 large pies, one with pepperoni and sausage and the other with mushrooms and ricotta cheese. Made fresh and fired in an authentic brick oven, our pizza piping hot and smelled deliciously of fresh basil. The dough however, was a bit soggy from the tomato sauce and would droop and fall apart as we tried to bite into it. I usually like to add gratuitous amounts of shredded or grated parmesan to my pizza, but here at Grimaldi's, parmesan came with an extra charge so I decided to forgo my usual endulgence.\n\nThough tasty, I didn't really feel that this was the best pizza that I had ever enjoyed. Besides the hype (which I found out later to be largely due to their reputation as a tourist trap), I felt that Grimaldi's served better than average pizza, but certainly not the best. It's worth trying, but go for the pizza and not for the service. Just remember that, if you raise any sort of fuss, prepare to be pushed around and barked at because they are definitely not in the business of non-sense there.
