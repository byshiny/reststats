We ordered a large pie with ham, mushrooms, onions, and extra tomatoes. The sauce was ok, and I like thin crust pizza, but this one was soggy. When I got to the non-soggy crust at the end, I found the crust to be pretty good, but it was overly burnt. I'm glad the wait wasn't longer, because once I tried the pizza, I realized that this place was more about the experience than the pizza. I prefer Pizza Moto.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2ggi1luerd3Mf_C82JvCYg?select=gi4KV5Nvh3nYePNke6QPtw\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2ggi1luerd3Mf_C82JvCYg?select=LBk0xaMfjJV0qilmoMJiMA", "author": "Sallina Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-01", "description": "Very good pizza. It comes in a very close second to Lombardi's. The texture of the dough and taste of the tomato sauce is what I like a little bit better at Lombardi's. But still very good here at Grimaldi's. \n\nThe crust comes out with some brunt blistered sections that add a great toasty crunch and flavor. It's then softened with the fresh melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and fresh basil. The large is about $14 and each topping if I remember correctly was $1.50. I only had pepperoni which was great. \n\nThere was a group of about 15 Korean young men and women at a table. The nice Italian owner asked them what were they doing in NYC. They told him they are a choir from Korea doing some concerts around NYC. The owner asked for a quick song; they sang a 10 second song. They sounded great. About 10 minutes later, the owner asked them for another song. So the group stood around the restaurant and sang a Korean choir song that lasted about two minutes. Wow did they sound great! I didn't think this place had good acoustics. \n\nIf anybody speaks Korean, can you please tell me what does the name of this song mean. It sounded like: au-dee-do. \n\nA good late lunch and a short concert, all under the Brooklyn Bridge. It was cool as hell. The owner gave them all free canolli for their performance. \n\nIf Yelp would allow video I would upload it. If anyone knows how, please let me know. \n\nEven with this large group the restaurant was half full, thus we didn't have to wait in any line. But I would not wait over 45 minutes in the 29\u00ba weather for this pizza. That is just too brutal. \n\nTip: If you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge; you don't have to walk all the way to Tillary St. There is an stairway exit on the left as soon as you pass the second tower of the bridge. It leads you to Cadman Plaza E. Then make a right at the end of the stairway, it'll leave you in the neighborhood.", "author": "Juan G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-03", "description": "Pizzza Pizzaa!!

No joke, elliots frozen pizza is ten times better. \n\nMay i also point out, if you like thin crust, proportioned amounts of cheese and tomato and bread, you will have a better time at 2 Bros Pizza. \n\nJust the fact that it was uncooked is disgusting.

It was ok....I mean we waited in the hot sun for about 30 minutes. Once we sat down service was average and I wasn't that impressed with the pizza. Also, they only take cash and they don't even serve beer. Beer and Pizza go together like peanut butter and jelly!

I never ended up coming though, mainly because of the long lines comprised of tourists and the fact that the other awesome joints that have popped up in Brooklyn are keeping my pizza tooth happy. But we finally ventured out on a recent Saturday night with a few friends and sampled some of the famous NY-style pizza.\n\nI have to say, I guess I am biased and really tend to prefer Italian-style pizza because while our pizza was tasty, I wasn't in love the way I have been with other spots. It is good, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't mouth-watering-kick-ass awesome. I couldn't even really eat the crust (not a good sign). On top of that, it was incredibly hot in the restaurant (on a night that wasn't) and the service wasn't great. The waiters seemed very rushed and didn't have time to even bring us water refills for a while.\n\nI'm glad I went for the Grimaldi's experience, but probably won't be rushing back anytime soon.", "author": "Sara K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-01", "description": "I would give Grimaldis 5 stars, but because their service wasn't up to par with their amazing pizzas, I had to give them 4 stars. \nCash only, can't order by slice.

Grimaldi's is a chain and because of that will go into the chain category of mediocre food that was once good but is sub par at best. The dough is too chewy even though it's thin crust, the basil isn't fresh and used sparingly and the cheese is so damn heavy even though it's fresh.\n\nThere's no way I'd wait in line again to eat here. I'd rather grab street pizza in the city. Also, it's cash only. Really? I've been to hole in the wall pizzerias that accepted cc.\n\nDon't believe the hype.

Definitely worth the line. Service was meh and the restaurant operation seemed disorganized and chaotic.

The pizza came out with one wrong topping, mushroom instead of anchovies that my out-of-town guest wanted to try.  When we brought it up, our server offered to bring us anchovies on the side.  We declined and preferred to have a new replacement.  The server removed the wrong pizza and we waited.\n\nOur new pizza came out supper dry and chewy with hardly any basil.  On top of that, our bill was over charged, plus a $4.50 tip added automatically, and the bill was unreadable with just numbers and no description.  \n\nFor a $12 pizza, $3/topping, one $3 soda and water.  A $20 lunch for 2 was billed $32.  On any other day, for most people, we would add another 20% tip, which would make it a $40 lunch.  The total seemed alarming, but our server disappeared somewhere.  So we called another server over who explained the bill to us and took off the obvious extra soda that we did not order.\n\nThe bill was adjusted to $29.20.  We gave the server $40.  He brought back $10 without the change.  Aside from the over-charge (on the basil as we got just about 4 burnt leaves which should not be considered a topping), our server forced a tip of $5.30.  \n\nI did not want to nickel and dime further, just paid and got out of there, as the experience has been unpleasant enough for my guest\n\nI can't help but wonder if this has become a systemic cheating scheme.

It's not often you can taste the fresh tomatoes in the tomato sauce.
