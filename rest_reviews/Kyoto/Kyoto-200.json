The quality is always there, the staff is very friendly and competent. Like another poster said, the owner is usually there, and is a very nice guy. I went here one evening because Ki Sushi down the street was too crowded, and Kyoto had just opened, so gave it a try - I haven't gone back to Ki since, this place has better food and service.", "author": "Mark W."}], "servesCuisine": "Sushi Bars", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Kyoto", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "115 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XgCNWOcuivDv-SsBz6gw9A/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185225888"}
