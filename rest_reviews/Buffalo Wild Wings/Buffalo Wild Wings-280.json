I regret not trying out the spicier sauce . The other thing we got were cheese fries. I was expecting something more like cheese sauce, on the fries but instead it was like microwaved packaged cheese. The cheese was hard on top of the fries, not very appetizing . I think the fries alone would've been better and cheaper!", "author": "Amey C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-18", "description": "Service was a bit quirky but very friendly , very attentive, fast, efficient, and friendly.  I was pleasantly surprised at the awesome service.\n\nThe wings have great flavor.  Maybe a tad on the smallish side (I would say 6 wings would be a lunch for a normal sized person).  They might be a *tad* dry, but you're supposed to put sauce on them anyhow (we ordered the dry rub).\n\nThe boneless \"wings\" are not wings at all.  They're really chicken tenders with a nicely flavored crusty crunchy outside.   The thing that makes them different from, say, Chicken McNuggets would be the fact that they're a bit spicy and crunchy.\n\nThe salt and garlic fries were delicious, but I let my wife eat most of them since I try to avoid all that salt.\n\nSome complain that this place gets rowdy.  It wasn't like that on Monday ~2:30, but I can see how the place might get rowdy during sports events.  I can see it's restaurant veneer can turn bar-like with the right (or wrong?) crowd.\n\nPersonally?

First, they stopped us and asked for IDs.  We're all the same age, but one of my friends has a later birthday, so he was still 17.  They refuse to seat us, saying that we had to be 18 years old with state IDs.  We asked why and the lady told us that kids have been cutting school to eat there.  It's summer vacation and there is no school, lady.  All I wanted was some chicken, damnit.\n\nSo we ordered to go and wow, I was disappointed.  The onion rings were good, that was about it.  I didn't like the teriyaki sauce they had.  The boneless chicken was kind of gross.  Maybe their wings are better.  I heard such good things about this place too.

Just bad. I've been here maybe 2 years ago for their beer pitchers and wings, and thought it was an acceptable establishment for those foods. But the experience this time around was not a good one.\n\nFirst, a few of us got different pints (and types) of beer and they all tasted off... a little flat or watered down was the consensus. One person asked for a different pint of beer, and it tasted slightly better.\n\nSecondly, the nachos was just not... barely edible. I would think most people could toss together nachos better than what was served to us.\n\nThe only upside... tablet trivia! When we inquired about it from a waitress, she was surprised and quite happy that we asked for it. Apparently, she had for some time offered the trivia tablets to patrons but kept getting puzzled faces that she had stopped asking. We were the first to use/ask for them!

So we traveled all the way fron Harlem  (without know BWW opened in Midtown) just for some wings and brews. We enter the place and they said that it would be a 30 minute wait and we should put pur names on the list.\n\nThis place is completely disorganized and there is no real system to track thwir waiting list. We put our names on the list and headed to the bar because we didn't come out to hold the walls up.\n\n About an hour into the wait a waiter crashers into the wall and spills wings, hot sauce and ranch or bleu cheese sauce all over us. Our coats, face, backsides, shoes, bags and everything. And that's not even the issue. We  calmly asked for the manager to resolve the mess and get some napkins, I'm not a fan of being covered in sauce.  Thank you Javier for your apology.\n\nSo all the while we're checking the status of our wait and we're no where near bring seated after a 2 1/2 hour wait. The response I received was a chuckle and smile and the excuse that people are staying to watch the UFC fight and other games. There is no flow of business if you're letting customers sit without ordering anything for hours and hanging on to the last sip of their drinks. \n\nWho is in charge of revenue management? Who handles customer satisfaction? Where is the flow?  Where is the trafficking?\n\nI gave this place 2 starts because I like the brand, the wings and the brews but this location needs a bar rescue and a new way of practicing business. \n\nWe frequent the Barclay's for concerts and games but I promise you that we do not recommend and will never visit this Buffalo Wild Wings again.", "author": "QC C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-10", "description": "Ah, BW3s.\n\nSo good, so delicious and so fun. \n\nMy good group of pals and I decided to embark on a journey into Brooklyn due to the fact that there was no college football or NFL games on for the first time in a long time.

It's not the fact that their wings are the best wings I ever tasted, or their beer is of the greatest beer of my life or anything like that, but it's the ambiance really.

My rating is simply for the wings. This location was not for me as it was jammed packed with teenagers from various nearby high schools. \n\nI ate at the Atlantic Center mall location in Bklyn, across the street from the Barclay's Center. I entered through a side door that had a sign for Buffalo Wild Wings and Applebee's. I rode the escalator up, only to find that I was at the take out only section. I had to walk across the entire restaurant in order to find the actual entrance where the hostess/greeter was standing. That was a little bit annoying. \n\nWhen the waiter came over and said that since it was Tuesday, all wings were $0.55, I quickly forgot about the rowdy teens, and trek across the restaurant. I ordered my traditional wings with teriyaki sauce and a small cup of mac and cheese. It was delicious! \n\nI left there with a full belly, and still had money in my pocket.

The waiter that took our order was gladly helping us with his opinion on what to get because it was our first time. Tuesday was a special deal on Traditional Wings and Thursday is Boneless Wings! While the wings took a while to come the waiter was supplying us with water and reminds us that it's going to be coming right up.\n\nI ordered a Large Traditional Wings with Parmesan Garlic, Honey BBQ and Sweet BBQ and Buffalo Chips with Cheese. Honey BBQ wings were really dry so I wouldn't recommend this as for others are more juicy.  My friends ordered all the spicy flavors for wings, a burger, and Jalape\u00f1o Pepper Bites. Seems to me they're into spicy food.\n\nAs we got our check it was pretty cheap. Came out to be $57 for a meal for 4.
