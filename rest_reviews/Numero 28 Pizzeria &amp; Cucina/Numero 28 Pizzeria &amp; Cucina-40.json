The food, as it's always been, was on point. (So far I've tried the reginella and frichetta pizzas, the homemade fettuccine in tomato sauce topped with fresh basil, and the bruschetta). The classic, fresh flavors plus the kindness of my waiter just made my night.\n\nThank you, guys.

The service was outstanding !! They even had some very nice wines by the glass.  There is a large outdoor eating area which unfortunately it was too hot to use today. It would be lovely place to eat on a cooler evening.", "author": "Ivan K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-14", "description": "Came here for lunch and it was empty.  We were the only table. Probably because it the place was full of smoke - seems as though they need to fix their ventilation system.  Waitress apologized for the smoke, so at least they owned up to it.  Waitress was neglectful because she was busy with a table towards the kitchen full of papers and a laptop.  It's completely fine to handle paperwork during business hours, but not to the point of neglecting people.  At one point, the waitress was MIA at one point and people came in looking for anyone to be seated. Turns out she had completely stepped out of the building! She came in after a few minutes, to the surprise of the people seeking food and service.  Food is okay.  It's probably better to give delivery from this place than dining at their location.", "author": "Diana M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-23", "description": "Thisisa very nice a pee zah.

I can get equal to better pizza at many local take out spots. They used frozen spinach on one of our pies, the dough was ordinary and the bottom was soggy all the pies I tried. If I was paying $4 a slice st a local take out spot I wouldn't mention it, but I was expecting better from Numero 28. Service was on point, no complaints there.", "author": "S.

I had the Broccoli pizza and the sausage tasted like it was bad.  It was unpleasant at best.  I picked the pizza apart and didn't eat the majority of it; our server didn't even ask if it was OK. When we walked in, the hostess tried to seat us at a 2 top in between 2 other tables. Totally get this logic if the restaurant is crowded, however, it was not crowded, at all.  More than half the restaurant was empty.  She insisted we sit at this table even after I politely asked her to seat us somewhere else.  Not 1 table filled up for the entire hour and a half we were there.

We ordered a medium diavolo and it was perfection. It arrived on a long wood cutting board which was a nice rustic touch. We have been to a few other wood fired pizza places and all had very wet crusts. N\u00famero 28 has it down to a science be every piece had the perfect (to us) consistency. I adore the charred color on the crust and it adds that amazing smokey taste. The sauce is insane. It tastes just like the freshest tomato and not tomato paste. The soppressata is a lovely textural topping and the mozzarella was nicely melted. \nThe decor and ambience was a nice rustic/urban cafe feel. We loved that the front windows were open for that indoor/outdoor dining experience. While the service left a bit to be desired the food made up for it. This is definitely going to become our regular pizza fix.", "author": "Jennifer H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-30", "description": "Mediocre pizza (soggy in middle).

With the noise and the socializing, we probably should have been put off to one side so as not to bother everyone else in the restaurant.  Rustic but modern decor.  Friendly and attentive service.
