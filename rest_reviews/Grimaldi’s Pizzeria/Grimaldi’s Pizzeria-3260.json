They create these fine pizza's in their hand shoveled, coal oven.  They use FRESH mozzarella, wonderfully spiced and fresh tomato sauce, and the crust is thin and a bit smokey -- even the pepperoni is the most tasty I have had (and a bit spicy-er than most.)\n\nIf you are looking for this place, cross the Brooklyn Bridge into Brooklyn, walk beneath the bridge and look for a line which stretches from its door all the way back to the corner . . . these are the faithful followers of this wonderful delicacy -- and it is worth the wait.\n\nDon't expect to come here for the atmosphere, wide ranging menu or the shoulder room -- none of that exists here -- but be prepared to give your taste-buds a treat.  Their antipasto is a nice treat while waiting for your pie -- it has a nice selection of olives, fresh mozzarella, salami, and fire roasted red peppers.\n\nAND be sure to bring cash as they don't accept plastic here (except at the ATM at the front door -- but of course you will pay a surcharge for the privilege.)\n\nIf you are looking for better atmosphere, a wider ranging menu, a place that accepts plastic, or alcohol -- or don't want to have to wait outside in bad weather -- and still have this wonderful pizza, then definitely visit Grimaldi's Garden City (Long Island), location.  It is just as good in Garden City.\n\nIf you are in Brooklyn for this treat, don't forget to enjoy desert at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory down at the promenade -- it's the best ice cream in the area.", "author": "Jeffrey K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-04", "description": "I've had some legendary pizza in my day, but Grimaldi's is the measuring stick. It is without a doubt the best I've ever had, hands down.\n\nWhen I daydream about New York pizza, I usually gravitate towards those little hole-in-the-wall joints where fat greasy dudes in stained white tees throw a slice on a paper plate \u0026 slide it over a smeared countertop to you. Yeah, that's the authentic NY pizza experience right there. The good thing about these daydreams is that I can be in almost any major metropolitan area \u0026 find a joint or two that can pull this off fairly well. Maybe it won't be quite as good, but it's close enough, \u0026 close enough is good enough for me.\n\nThis is why I need to push Grimaldi's out of my heart \u0026 throw away the key. Grimaldi's is the one that got away. It's the best there is. There aren't a whole lot of places out there remotely capable of doing it like Grimaldi's (though I've found Gialina in San Francisco to be a pretty nice consolation prize). \n\nThat's why I cut Grimaldi's out of all our pictures together, \u0026 buried all the things it gave me. I'm just trying to save myself the heartache.

This place seems to have bought its own hype just a bit much. For $2.00 you can afford to actually COVER the thing in pepperoni, basil, mushrooms, or the like. \n\nService is a part of having patrons.

Lots of yummy toppings to choose from, the possibilities of pizza combos are very promising and tasty. Grimaldi's does brick oven pizza justice. If wine's your thing, order a carafe/bottle to complement the flavor. \n\nUnless you go early afternoon on a weekday, expect lines. I say: wait on.

The cheese was distributed nicely and the basil was a nice addition although I had to pay something like $2.50 extra for that (when I could've gone to DiFara's and had fresh, in house grown basil lovingly clipped to adorn my hot-from-the-oven pizza).  I must say that I don't usually get pepperoni but the stuff at Grimaldi's was quite good.  Either way, all of the parts did not add up to the perfect whole!\n\nI went in kind of biased too after reading a review on another cite in which a diner watched a family of five roll-up in a limo, pay off the host and walk right in, completely by-passing the intensely long line that was already formed. And that's another reason why we should all realized that Grimaldi's doesn't seem like they care for the locals anymore...and that makes a huge difference, at least in my book.\n\nBottom line...it's not worth they hype or the long wait!", "author": "Jessica G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-12-10", "description": "This place is for Tourists!!!\n\nGrowing up and eating pizza at the REAL Mariello's in the Village (RIP) as a kid in the 80s, I heard all the hype about this place and man was I sorely disappointed. The sauce was runny, whats up with the droopy chewy crust?  \nThe good thing I have to say was that the pepperoni was almost chorizo-like, which i give props to for its uniqueness, and the homemade mozzarella was creamy. I think its appeal here is the handmade thin crust, what I would expect real pizza to taste like in Italy. But it is truly over-hyped in terms of cost and I would never wait on line for this place again, especially if you are bringing friends living in Manhattan.

This was my first and last time. Yet another case of mediocrity with hype from people who have not had good pizza. This is clearly a place you take a tourist to see pictures of how old New York used to be and to walk around in the DUMBO area. Once they're starving, anything tastes a lot (maybe a ton in some cases) better.\n\nThe red and white checkered plastic table cloths gross me out. How the heck are you supposed to disinfect these things? Elbows catching on semi-sticky plastic is not an appetizing asset.\n\nAnyway, onto the pizza. The toppings were good, but our server put olives and onions on our pizza after we had only specially ordered mushroom and sausage. How hard can it be to screw up toppings and they usually taste about the same across the board unless if they're rotten (they weren't here).\n\nSoda comes in a plastic bottle (so not old-fashioned). There was no wait on a Friday night a month ago, but we left half a pizza and did not bother to take it home since it was that bad. The sauce was skimpy and the crust flavorless. \n\nI think people go here for the location since it has breathtaking views of the Brooklyn Bridge. Too bad Grimaldi's doesn't face it from inside because then there would be a positive of coming here. \n\nMy quest continues for above average pizza in NYC...", "author": "clb k."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-31", "description": "Every time I eat here it's a life-altering mind-blowing experience.
