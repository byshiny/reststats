Happy to say my experience there was just lovely. Had lunch there with my aunt and my cousin. We shared two delicious appetizers: the burratta and the guacamole with crudites. The burratta was creamy and sweet, and the guacamole was a bit chunky and nicely seasoned.\n\nOur main dishes were very nice as well. My aunt had the salmon with asparagus, which she enjoyed; cousin had the asparagus bagna cauda, which she loved; I had the porchetta and artichoke flatbread pizza -- the smaller size -- and it was perfect for lunch.\n\nWe shared two desserts, which were lick-the-plate delicious: chocolate mousse and tart and pistachio gelato. Perfect finishes to the meal.\n\nYes, we had made reservations. Yes, it was busy, but the service was friendly and attentive. The setting is lovely. It's not a place to just drop in, especially during the busiest times of day and especially during the warmer months when more folks are out and about. But make a reservation and go!", "author": "Dorrie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-21", "description": "Great Food, Service and views!!!! :) Their pasta, pizza and appetizers are to die for!", "author": "Ibernia P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-08-21", "description": "Worst wait ever! 40 minutes after appetizers, the waiter came around to apologize for the long wait for the entrees. 20 more minutes after that the manager came by to apologize for the wait. These 60 minutes no one refilled the water nor the bread. 15 minutes more then came the entrees. While waiting I saw a silverfish crawling across the floor toward my feet. I squashed it. When the entrees finally came, the seared skin of the branzino was too salty, the seared skin of the salmon was too salty, and the pasta dish was also too salty. Aside from the waterfront view, I don't understand why anyone would dine here.", "author": "G.

This may sound negative but it is not.  It is just some insight.  Key lesson, don't be fooled by Open Table or the barrier thrown up if you show up without a reservation.  In other words, give it a chance.  There were no reservations available until Sept 11 for a table of 4.   That said, we showed up and asked for a table for 3 and after the game of 'do you have a reservation?' there was no issue to be seated right away and it was clear that there would be no issue to be seated, so drop the perception your doing me a favor.   My view it is better to admit, there are limited number of reservations but keep some tables available for 'walk ups'\n\nWe ended up sitting at the bar and again had an awesome experience.  Service was attentive and more importantly the food was great - fresh ingredients, flavors well developed and helpings appropriate to enjoy the serving..  We expanded on the shishito peppers, risotto verde, chicken under a brick and caponata all consistently and well prepared.   We expanded to try the rigatoni and pizza with mozz; tomato and basil.  Both basic but brilliantly and freshly prepared.\n\nAgain from my prior review, I appreciate that the size of the restaurant necessitates creating a 'vibe' but given the growth of the neighborhood and surrounds, I hope the restaurant finds the vibe it deserves with the reality of those who will be regulars.", "author": "Ben C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "I went to Cecconi's this weekend and unfortunately was disappointed in the meal. \n\nPros:\nAmazing burrata - one of the best I've had\nPizza was delicious, though the truffle one was not worth the $$\nAmazing view\nLobster pasta had a lot of actual lobster in it (but the sauce was bland)\n\nCons:\nTheir kitchen was completely disorganized - they brought out one person's entree with the appetizers, followed by half the entree, then salad, then the sides of the person who already finished their entree, followed by the rest of the meal... completely wrong.\nWe received incorrect cocktails\nTwo glasses of wine were corked\nCalamari was rubbery\nManager didn't even bother to come over after we mentioned our issues to the server\nAll the tourists stare at you since you're right on the pedestrian walkway\n\nAll in all, fine for drinks and an app but definitely not worth the money for an actual meal.", "author": "Allison K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-17", "description": "Went the day before they opened, met the manager who was nice and friendly, told him we lived in the neighborhood and were excited to be regulars.\n\nWe left and came back a couple days later on Saturday, 20min before opening. The extremely curt and rude hosts, like robots told us, sorry, we are fully committed but we are accepting limited walk ins. Not friendly AT ALL and very cold although we were really friendly to them.\n\nI asked for a menu and there was no, \"here you go, let me know if you have questions, please feel free to take a menu, etc.\" Nothing, just blank stares. Decided to leave and go to the lovely coffee shop next door, an outpost of a great Vin Hill restaurant. Finished and walked by Cecconi's again about an hour later, TOTALLY empty. I mean, why lie?? And why lie to potential returning customers who live in the hood?? Who else is going to be going to this place when you turn away ALL the locals?\n\nThis whole snobby experience is beyond me. We live in a luxury condo in dumbo and live a pretty good life and to be treated like we were low class vagabonds and didn't deserve any real treatment from this restaurant is not acceptable. I will not be coming back to this place. This attitude at the front is enough for me to dismiss this place.

We walked in and were seated promptly on the outside patio that had an incredible view of the Brooklyn Bridge. The GM came over to greet us and he was so sweet and welcoming! My little cousin who is 7 was with us so we ordered him the Margherita pizza and he loved it. \n\nI ordered the risotto verde and it was super delicious. My uncle got the Ahi tuna tartare that was very light and refreshing. The salmon was also great!\n\nFor drinks I would definitely recommend the house ros\u00e9!!\n\nThis place is slightly upscale but it really depends on what time you go.

Upon our arrival the front desk people were very nice, they stored our luggage out back ( we were flying home after this dinner ) We were giving the seat right by the entrance, we asked if this was the best they could do and the hosted said \"everyone wants good seats\" well did everyone in your establishment this evening call three weeks prior? I would have to guess I don't think so. We tried to make the best of it, an ordered drinks, apps and dinner. The drinks were good and the app was very good, but dinner my lasagna were just ok, one ordered pizza and it was good nothing spectacular. We tired to get our waitress attention three of four times for little things, never saw her again until we got our bill- I have to stay I was sad by the lack luster of this visit and so was my son whom wanted our last place we ate/ visited to be special. My son had ate her prior had a different experience so I am hoping they just had a off night. I have to say after leaving the restaurant we walked outside and the view is just amazing of the city and bridges.", "author": "Debra P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-22", "description": "The service was really great.

We are all in the fashion business.

I objected as I looked into an empty dining room.. hostess went back to podium and seemed firm in saying this was our table..a waitress walked by and said there are plenty of tables in the dining room.. do not settle.. all this is very humiliating.. so When the hostess never came back I escorted my clients to an open table and we sat down.. the waiter greeted us and took drink orders but the maitre 'd came over twice to further humiliate and berate us for sitting in the empty dining room If we were 3 men this would never have happened..
