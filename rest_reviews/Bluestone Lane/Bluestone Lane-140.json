The espresso was quite nice and average priced for the area. The donut was very pricy for how small it was, but on the other hand it was tasty and super rich.", "author": "Aliz C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-09", "description": "Super cute coffee shop with a totally underrated bar! Our bartender Aj was really sweet and seemed to take a lot of pride in her work. Her negronis are a dream and the espresso martinis are delicious too (we stayed for a few rounds ;). Ask Aj to make you her spiked matcha lemonade. Its not on the menu but its super good. As for the menu, I had the banana waffle and my boyfriend the open squash face sandwich , per Aj's request- both were amazing! definitely recommend this place!", "author": "Ana P."}], "servesCuisine": "Gluten-Free", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Bluestone Lane", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "55 Prospect St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xZ_JE8vg052rCtm_EErp1Q/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17183746858"}
