You can pick you choice of \nmeat: bison, beef,...\nsides : sweet potato fries, French fries, onion rings, ..\nDrinks : beer, wine, cocktails\nIt's nice and comfortable, it's great to finally find a place you  aren't rushed to leave. \nMy grind house was delicious. The relish and paprika mayo was a great combo.\nI would highly recommend this place. \nCan't wait to come back and try another organic burger.", "author": "Camille G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-12", "description": "Amazing tasty food!!!

My husband and I sat at an outside table, such a fab day in NY. (Too bad I didn't pack enough warm weather clothes). Looked at the menu and bummed.  Weirdo, millennial salads on the menu . I hate kale.  So I went for a burger.  Everything organic, bison burger and onion rings were top notch. A pleasant surprise.  Not what I was looking for but it worked for me .  Now just get a normal, with romaine lettuce or Boston lettuce or something non frickin kale salad on the menu", "author": "Joanne A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-01", "description": "I met up with my cousin in New York whom I haven't seen since I was a toddler, and we were so excited to see each other.  We we both searching around Brooklyn for a place to eat, and we stumbled across this place.  Neither of us had been or heard of it before, but we had a very helpful waiter who explained to us the concept of this restaurant.  It's a burger joint that specializes in using all natural and organic ingredient for everything, from the meat, to the toppings, to the condiments; it's a chain restaurant that primarily operates in the northern part of the US.  \n\nMy cousin and I were looking through the menu and saw some pretty interesting choices.  Ultimately I decided on the \"Fire Quacker\" which was a duck burger and My Cousin got the the \"Social\" which was a turkey Burger;  It was my first time eating a duck burger and his first time eating a turkey burger.  \n\nI must say that I quite enjoyed my meal here, and I believe my cousin did too. The burger itself as well as the fries and ketchup all tasted \"different\" and to be honest \"weird\", but it was a good kind of weird, like the \"I'm not used to eating organic food, is this what my food is supposed to taste like weird\" haha.  \n\nOverall, this location had good food and friendly service.  The next time I find myself up north I I will definitely consider getting another delicious organic burger from BareBurger.", "author": "Jordan B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-23", "description": "So we came here yesterday to celebrate my daughter bday with about 12 people. We waited maybe 6-7 minutes for two tables to clear, the kids had their own table and the adults had theirs, with the exception of two adults sitting at the bar. The food was pretty good but the waiter service was horrible. It seemed like they kept forgetting our order. We even had to keep flagging them down for basic things, like cups for our water and utensils for our food. They kept apologizing saying they were swamped but when I looked around it seemed like everyone was served, so I couldn't understand. Even when other customers showed up, they were being attended to better than our table. They even put knives on our kids table! Like who does that??? I was so upset.\n\nAnyway, the manager knew all the craziness that was going on and took the drinks off our bill and gave us an additional 15% off. While the food was pretty good, I don't think it's worth the headache to return here again.", "author": "Sacha P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-22", "description": "The food here is amazing, fresh and unbelievably delicious!!!!

Everything was delicious, and I have no problem paying $12 for the California burger, the ginberry cocktail was spot on, and the pickle chips were awesome.\n\nTiming though: awful. In lieu of a side of fries, I got fried pickles off the snack section. When taking my order, the girl asked if I wanted them first or with my meal. As I was forgoing fries, I wanted them with my meal.\n\nThe burger came out relatively quickly, but the pickles came out 10 minutes later...ugh. I guess next time I'll ask for them to arrive first.", "author": "Heather C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-07", "description": "The service was atrocious and when we brought this up with the hostess, she told us that she didn't care if we ever came back.  Therefore, our families will never come back.  The service entailed: no salad dressing for the salad, the wrong wine, the wrong food, not giving us the food we ordered, and we had to send our kids in to ask for the check and pay for it.

I love that I can get my gluten free and vegetarian on here!\n\n2) It's always fresh tasting and I feel GOOD about eating here.\n\nI am also obsessed with the Guadalupe wrapped in collard greens.  Honestly, I'm still dreaming about how good it was.  Black bean patty was a great bean texture and flavor, pickled onions added a kick and the alfalfa spouts was a nice little surprise in my mouth. And the guacamole was obvi on point, because when is guac NOT a good idea?\n\nThe only reason I am taking off 1 star is that it is a bit pricey. Paid $14.32 + tip for my burger and fries.

The staff here is friendly, knowledgeable and the atmosphere is very inviting.\n\nOften I'll grab a burger for lunch. My favorite is the \"El Matador\" which is a bison burger. It's tastes very similar to beef except it's a leaner meat so for those trying to eliminate as much fat from their diet as possible try the bison. It has queso fresco, pickled jalape\u00f1os and guacamole giving it a ton of flavor. Deff stick with it being cooked medium for the perfect amount of juiciness.\n\nThe salads are also a hit for me. They're slightly expensive for the portion size I feel but they are fresh and tasty. \n\nFor a non-alcoholic beverage to those who love ginger, try the ginger Brew. It's amazing. Wine and beer is served as well.", "author": "Justin H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-04-01", "description": "Placed an order online for pick up and the order was messed up. I don't understand how this happens. My boyfriend ordered the supreme burger and they left off the onion rings and french fries, which is what makes the burger so fun. The good thing was his meat was cooked the way he liked it, and after calling they gave us a refund for his order. I ordered a bison burger which was ok, but I wanted it rare or medium rare and it was well done which was very disappointing. \n\nWhen I went in to go pick it up, the food at the tables looked so good, but when you get it to go, it just looks like a thrown together fast food burger.

That being said, this particular location - by far - is the worst of the franchise as far as I could tell. Service was crap. Good arrived late \u0026 cold + one item was apparently dropped on the kitchen floor so my son had to wait for the replacement which arrived by the time we finished our cold food. By the time his food arrived, it was not correct but we let it go. Then they claimed to give us a discount meanwhile we were charged for items we didn't receive! This place is typically understaffed \u0026 the very few that work there are extremely clueless \u0026 careless. Will never ever dine at this location again.
