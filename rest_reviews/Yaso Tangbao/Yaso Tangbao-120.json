I am super lucky this is right by my Brooklyn office. \n\nOn a normal day, I'll typically order the garlic cucumber salad (extremely refreshing) and 2 orders of the 4 piece pork soup dumplings.The broth in the dumplings is great, full of thickness and flavor! The cold cucumber salad adds a nice balance to the hot meal. \n\nOn a more hungover day (but worth a bit more $), I definitely recommend the Braised Pork Meatballs Over Rice with Egg. The meat is again, very flavorful, and the fried egg completes the meal. I'll usually order a hot and sour soup with this as well. \n\nJust a few tips: Beware of the lunch crowd which usually comes through at noon. I sometimes make the run for it around 11:30 so I don't have to wait in line. And be prepared to wait a few extra minutes if you order the soup dumplings, it is always prepared hot and fresh. Seating has communal tables and bar seating which for the most part, is limited due to the crowd. \n\nFIVE STARS all the way.

With a good friend and fellow poet we trekked to downtown Brooklyn in hopes for Shanghaiese cuisine.  Our first impression was great dismay and utter disappointment to see a street panhandler quietly begging for money among Yaso Tangbao customers walking between tables which the staff did not confront the disturbed man to usher him out for a fast exit.  Orders are fulfilled by screaming out your order number stated on your sales receipt for self-pickup (no waiter service) on cheap flimsy  disposable utensils.  Seating appears wooden picnic tables with stools (no backing) and a restroom facility on the premise.  Water is free and available at the amenity/ condiment counter.\n\nChicken Curry Crispy Noodle $8.75 - overflowing with heavy MSG and layers of grease, the noodles were excessively too crunchy and chicken was extremely pink in color for the appearance that it was undercooked.  When inquiring to the the cashier/server staff showing the color appearance of the chicken our response was a callous, dismissive attitude \"that is the way we cook it\" subsequently the female cashier/server turn her back and walked away dismissing concerning issue refusing to divulge a valid response.  We both fallen slightly ill from un-cooked chicken and the heavy MSG cooking lard induced.  As the evening grew onwards I became a victim of diarrhea but my homemade remedy was Camomile tea and Chinese Pu-erh tea (bou2 nei2) \u666e\u6d31\u8336 to flush out the indigestion. \n\nYaso Pork Soup Dumplings $4.99- Xiao long bao (siu2 lung4 baau1) \u5c0f\u7c60\u5305, a Shanghainese staple which is prepared with excellence and effort filled with generous broth steamed in minced pork and served in traditional Chinese bamboo basket.  These siu2 lung4 baau1 is a must-have during a Shanghaiese meal.\n\nPork and Bok Choy Wonton Soup $6.95 - incorrectly overcharged as we order their daily special of Pork Siu Mai $4.95 but was billed for wonton soup.  We consumed pork siu mai- NOT wonton soup.  Our pork siu mai was NOT sweet or spicy as written on my sales receipt.", "author": "Tina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-29", "description": "Absolutely loved the food!

Do not get me wrong; the restaurant has a lovely setup and the service is pretty fast. Plus, the menu is pretty straightforward and ordering is a breeze. \n\nI ordered one of the spicy pork noodle soup and I found it to be kind of bland, because I put quite a bit of Sriracha in the soup. Also, the soup had a really high oil content . . . this amount of oil could be normal for Shanghainese food and it may not be a big deal for true fans of Shanghainese food.\n\nOn to the staple of what brings people here: SOUP DUMPLINGS. I ordered the crab and pork dumplings and I did not get a wow factor. Actually, I was a little disappointed, because I really did not taste any crab meat in them. \n\nPerhaps, I expected a lot because of all the reviews and the fact that there slim pickings for decent asian food in this particular part of downtown Brooklyn.  I will say that the price point is not too bad for the portions of food that you receive. I believe that I paid about 18 bucks for my noodle soup, the soup dumplings, and a soda, which is not a bad deal. It's a great place for a nice bite (or rather drink) to eat but I would am not super pressed to come back . . . maybe once in a blue moon.", "author": "Kwame S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-02", "description": "Thanks to everyone here on yelp for helping me find this awesome place! Another one of these recently opened in Sunset Park, but being in industry city it's really a lunch spot (and I not generally a lunch goer-outer) My mom has mentioned a few times that she wanted to find a dim-sum-esque place and I figured that since we were in the area and this place is open for dinner, it'd be a good spot. We got four dishes, the soy garlic noodles, cucumber salad, pork soup dumplings and pork and crab soup dumplings. The soy garlic noodles were delicious, and we wolfed them down as the soup dumplings were being prepared. The garlic cucumber salad paired well with their soy and ginger vinegar, and were a nice lighter bite to go with the rest of the food. (Their ginger vinegar was a favorite of both of ours!) Then came the star, the reason I suggested this place, the soup dumplings. Mom got pork and really enjoyed them- I got the pork and crab. (And if you're wondering like I was, it is definitely real crab!) We both liked our respective choices so much that we didn't even think to swap one to try the other's variety. And I didn't get a photo until 2 were already history... Overall it was a really great meal, and even including 2 ginger ales was under $30.

What a wonderful twist of fate! This place is awesome. You order on an iPad from a list of menu items, and everything I got was delicious.

There was good amount of vegetables in my veggie noodle soup and the portion was good, plus I did enjoy the garlic flavor in the soup, however, $9.35 is just too much for what I got. In Flushing or Chinatown, the same thing would only cost $6-$7 on average. My friend's Meatball noodle soup was even more unreasonably expensive. Almost $12 for a bowl of noodles just because there are 2 greasy meatballs?   4)) Hupi egg was tasty, but it's nothing more than a fried marinated (whole) egg.   5)) I do NOT recommend their savory soy milk. It tasted nothing but water with salt. No soy milk taste at all. Don't know why it's $1 more than the sweet version.\n\nStaff were friendly and helpful, but they need to adjust their pricing. It's Brooklyn, come on.\n\nP.S. Self-service dining style. They call up numbers and you go get your order.

It feels like Xian Food decided to open a Shanghai style eatery. You order by letter and number. We enjoyed:\n\nY1: Pork Soup Dumplings ($5 for 4), \nY3: Spicy Pork Soup Dumplings ($5.65 for 4), \nG5: Chinese vegetables saut\u00e9ed in garlic ($5.5)\nN1: Beef Noodle Soup, ($11.50) and \nB4: Hot and Sour Soup (3.50).\n\nThe dumplings were delicious and are freshly made. The skin was translucent, al dente, and had an opening at the top for ventilation. The meat had a perfect balance of lean and fatty pork. The broth was warm and unctuous. The only down side was that 3 of the 12 dumplings stuck to the paper and broke before getting to my mouth. \n\nThe Chinese vegetables were crispy with plenty of garlic. The beef noodle soup was not as good as xian food's tingly beef noodle soup. The noodles were very spaghetti like, the Braised beef was tender, the mustard greens and bok choy were tasty. The hot and sour soup was mediocre but worth the three dollars. \n\nThe place was crowded and the guy who shouted out the numbers for food pick up was confused.

Portions are a bit small, quantity wise - $6.95 for 4 blue crab and pork soup dumplings, but the quality is worth it. I've tried the above soup dumplings with perfectly tender skin. The Yaso pork bao which are like big pillowy clouds with roasted sesame seeds on top and stuffed with pork. But not an ample enough of pork. Pork Shao Mai - always pretty good. The green garden vegetable dumplings are shockingly incredibly tasty and packed with great flavor for you vegans out there. Their Shanghai cold noodles could use some more peanut sauce but the heat was good and the noodles had a nice texture. Fried chicken cutlet fillet was dappled with a nice hoisin sauce that I treated myself to smearing it all over my dress. \n\nMost surprising are usually their specials. I've only been here once but they keep coming out with innovative treats and dumplings. When we came in for our feast of all feasts before thanksgiving there was a cheese soup dumpling and it was pretty outrageously good. My favorites out of everything though would be the traditional crab and pork dumplings and shockingly the vegetarian. Nice set up here. They have long picnic tables and all the condiments are set to the side so you don't have to bother anyone about needing another bucket of sriracha sauce. There is usually a bit of a crowd. At least when I came in, which was a weekday during lunch time and I managed to take the day off, jam packed. Kind of surprised.

I order one of each (pork, crab, spicy crab), sweet and sour pork ribs, and braised beef noodles. I was told there would be a 20 minute wait for soup dumplings, which was fine since it'll be fresh. After 35 minutes, we decided to ask them where our order was. It's a busy night, we get it. But I would have gotten my soup dumplings by now if I ate at a sit down restaurant. \n\nWe get the first half of our order which was the pork soup dumplings, the beef stew noodles, and the pork ribs. I was so disappointed when the soup dumplings weren't pipping hot, but at this point I was so hungry I didn't want to ask for another one. The pork dumplings were warm. I didn't even have to let it sit or blow on it. To make it worst, it lacked flavor. There wasn't enough flavor in the soup or meat. I let it go, hoping the others are better. Another 15 minutes later, we get the crab and chili one. The crab was probably the best choice out of the 3. It has the sweetness of crab, but still lack some flavor. The spicy pork one is a skip for me. All you taste is oil and it's not even spicy. You can't even taste the meat because the oil overpowers everything.\n\nThe braised beef noodles is also a skip. You can get better beef noodles for a cheaper price elsewhere. Not only that, what you get doesn't look like the picture. What you get looks more like the diced pork one. It got me confused for a second.\n\nThe best thing out of all would be the sweet and sour pork. This was the most flavorful thing we had. It's actually sweet and not really sour. The bones easily came off and it wasn't dry.
