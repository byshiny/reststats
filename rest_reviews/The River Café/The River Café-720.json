The view of the vast lit-up Manhattan skyline was absolutely gorgeous, which is why I give it 4 stars. The food was good, but not amazing for me. For the price, I expected a little more quality and attention to detail on the food. The view is really what made it an unforgettable experience for me.

It's a bit stuffy, (jackets required) but the food and service are impeccable.

Although it has always been touristy with mediocre and overly priced food, it does have a good view but beware of their horrible customer service. The other night, I met my fianc\u00e9 for a drink before attending a dinner party at a friend's apartment directly across the street. I walked in with a small shopping bag which contained an expensive gift to bring to the party. When I arrived, I was looked up and down and asked if I wanted to check my shopping bag. I said no that was ok. I went to the bar, where an expensive glass of champagne had been ordered and was waiting for me. After a sip, a self-important arrogant man, I am assuming the manager, came up to me and asked to check my shopping bag, which was on the floor in front of my bar stool. It was definitely not in plain sight and, again, a small bag but he knew that I had walked in with it because I saw the hostess whisper to him before he came over. I, again, said \"that is ok. I just came for a quick drink and I will be leaving in five minutes.\" He insisted on checking my bag and said that I couldn't keep it with me. I then said the bag contains an expensive item for a friend across the street and I will be leaving as soon as I finish my drink. He just stood there and I said \"I would like to enjoy my drink and then I will be leaving.\" I felt harassed. Well, that was apparently not good enough for someone who gets a high off of a position of what he perceives as power. Again, he just stood there and said that this is the owner's policy and then turned to the bartender to say \"the lady would like her check.\" I could not believe the nerve and the scene he was causing. Even one of the bartenders raised an eyebrow. What a joke. I have been to and frequent he best and finest restaurants in the city-and The River Caf\u00e9 is not even in that category- and would NEVER be treated like that. The arrogance. All I can guess is that because they cater to tourists who may be arriving after a day of shopping, they do not want shopping bags in the dining room. I get that. But, a small shopping bag that is hidden beneath a chair? The restaurant was fairly empty and this is what he was spending his time on? It is clear that this twit and the owner Buzzy, who I have never heard good things about from those who know him, both need a good kick towards reality. The River Caf\u00e9 is and remains an overpriced and puffed up established. Don't waste your money. It is no Daniel, Le Bernardin, Bouley, Eleven Madison Park, etc. They may not have a view but they have amazing food, excellent service and class.", "author": "Ali R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-10", "description": "DESSERT AND THE VIEW = PRICELESS!\n\nWe came because of the Sopranos and the Brooklyn Bridge dessert and of course the view. The chocolate dessert shaped like the bridge above is awesome.", "author": "Nina P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-04", "description": "Totally forgot to write a review for this place. Came here in the winter time and OMG I was blown away by the view once I walked in. I almost cried because I forgot to bring my camera. Anyway, I don't remember what night I came on, but it was definitely a weeknight. Came with a group of 10 people and were seated right away. I guess the only complaint was that we were right next to the kitchen where all the servers were coming in and out.\n\nSo we ordered two bottles of Rose to start with. For those of you who don't know, the dinner is a pre-fixe menu @ $100 per person. Our group ordered different things and I couldn't help but pick at everyone's food. I ordered the pear salad, which was good. Except, I'm not a big fan of goat cheese, but at a hundred bucks per person, it's hard to go wrong with anything on that menu.\n\nFor entree, I ordered the crisp duck breast. Now being Chinese, I'm use to eating those roast ducks hanging in front of the windows in Chinatown. I must warn that the River Cafe does not prepare well done ducks. I did see that they left it a little pink in the center. Anyway, I gave it a try and it was actually pretty yummy. Very juicy and tender. I also had a taste of the steak, which was okay, but I would probably prefer Peter Luger when it comes to that department. For me, the Branzino, which was sea bass was a win. While the menu does not state, the dish is breaded and fried, but it was still awesome.\n\nAs for dessert, I ordered the caramelized apple tart AND the chocolate marquis brooklyn bridge. I wasn't paying, so I decided to be greedy. I loved the caramelized apple tart for its taste and the chocolate marquis for its presentation. But you can't go wrong with either one.\n\nSo the bill ended up to be around.... probably $1500??? for the entire table with complimentary chocolates at the end. AND FINALLY...  go for the view. Go for the food. Go for the excellent service. Oh, did I mention go for the view? :)", "author": "Winny L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-12", "description": "I would return here without hesitation. I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. The food and service were both excellent.

The atmosphere is romantic and beautiful. The live piano playing added a beautiful touch to the atmosphere. I got the rabbit appetizer which was delicious. I never thought I'd enjoy eating rabbit, but this was amazing. Husband got to oxtail ravioli which was equally good. For mains we got the duck breast and the strip steak- both delicious. I had the thought before coming \"how can the food be that good, to justify the price\"? As I ate, I answered my own question.

I worked there for a couple days, but I didn't stick around when I found out that the owner hates Hasidic jews and advises the staff to lie to them and say there are no tables available when they come in.

Nestled at the foot of Brooklyn Bridge, the view is simply phenomenal. \n\nSo, on special occasions, including my passing the bar exam, birthdays or anniversaries as well as my friend getting her permanent residence card or \"green card\" if you prefer, we go to River Cafe.  The waterfalls last year is now gone (maybe thankfully) as it messes up the salinity of the ground and kills the flowers outside River Cafe. They have valet parking or at times, there are parking spaces just outside the restaurant or up on the street towards Grimaldi's. \n\nIMy favorite entree here is  the rack of lamb, while my husband loves the sirloin steak.  The last time we dined,  my friend had the branzino.  Everything tastes perfection, the fish is fresh and flavorful, the rack of lamb tender and juicy while the steak is also tender and melts like butter. For dessert ,the Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge caps the experience  I was tempted not to eat it and save the bridge but I realized that it is best to eat it before such a fantastic view and savor the moment.  Then, we headed out (after paying the bill of course) and walked on the landing by the water. Until, we heard a gunshot.  \n\nIt turns out Law and Order SVU was shooting an episode. :-) That made us laugh as we headed home, promising to remember that, indeed, there are moments that you can rightfully call a perfect New York evening.", "author": "Lara G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-07-17", "description": "Bottom line: if you like to be treated with respect when you are about to plunk down $400 for dinner, DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.\n\nIf I stop one person from going to the River Cafe, I will be happy and feel that my job here is done.\n\nFirst let me start by saying, I truly believe that the ma\u00eetre d' has a chalk board in his little office behind the kitchen where he sadistically keeps track of how many women he causes to leave his restaurant in tears.
