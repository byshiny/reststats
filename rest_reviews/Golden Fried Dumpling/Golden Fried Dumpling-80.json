Enjoy it before it becomes another bubble-tea joint.\n\nMany other users find it lacking compared to Prosperity Dumpling and Vanessa's Dumpling House. But this is real street food, not a trendy imitation. You'll find this kind of place in Manhattan's Chinatown east of the Bowery, serving low-budget yet authentic comfort snacks, paying little for labor or ingredients or promotion. Yelpers' word of mouth brought me here, not a feature in Time Out New York.\n\nMy boiled cabbage-and-pork dumplings were tender and tasty (10 for $3). If the sesame-pancake sandwich had little sesame or scallion, and its roast pork was cold and fatty, and its carrot and cucumber slivers were more like salad than bahn mi, well, it was still worth its 1970s price of $2.25. I'll be back for other dishes (and more dumplings).", "author": "Josh K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "So this is more like a 3.5 - the extra half point is for how damned cheap it is and for how much I like unpretentious small businesses. But for the quality of the dumplings themselves and the offerings, it's not worth the 4+ star reviews that everyone seems to giving them. This is NOT Prosperity Dumpling. However, they do make all the dumplings completely from scratch, and deserve hard-earned credit for that. \n\nMy favorite order is the boiled chive and pork dumplings and juicy little buns. IMO most of the soups (except the sha cha beef soup) are flavorless. I wouldn't bother with the hot and sour soup, but the wonton soup is pretty nice. Note that the wonton soup is  fuzhou-style - meaning it's many pieces of seasoned pork wrapped in thin noodle wrappers. \n\nService is very fast and perfunctory in a heart-warmingly aggressive Chinese way - in other words not for the n00b. The cashier will expect you to remember your order # because that's what s/he'll be shouting loud enough to hear from 30ft outside the shop doors when your order is ready. Be prepared. \n\nIt's also crowded during lunch hours - on some days the line snakes around the shop.

I ordered the chow-mein noodles with chicken and 10 steamed dumplings (10 was WAY too many, but it was an option of 3 fried or 10 steamed.... not sure why but I just went with it).\n\nThe order was completed quickly- I paid under $10 and booked it back to my office to bask in its glory. The dumpling skins were a bit thick and I ended up peeling most of them off and just eating the pork-cabbage-mushroom filling, which was bound together nicely. The noodles were a bit greasy for my taste, but that's chow mein, and although they lacked flavor, it wasnt anything that a little sirracha couldnt fix.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this as a normal lunch spot for the rotation, specifically if your strapped for cash before pay day!\n\n\nUPDATE: I ordered the spicy noodles and it comes in a kimchii-broth..at first, i was disappointed in the spice, because it was pretty mild. Then.. about halfway through my consumption, it turned to a pleasing burn that made my nose run (perfect for this stormy day) and was the perfect portion to allow a glutinous noodle lover to bask in glory as digestion settled in.

I envisioned myself walking in there and throwing singles everywhere like a baller while I waited for some badass dumplings. What actually happened was that they ran out of a few items that I wanted to try like the juicy hot buns oww oww. I ordered a roast pork bun and the pork dumplings instead. The pork bun was definitely worth the $1.25. The dumplings however really were swimming in oil. I know that they're only 4 for $1 and I don't want to sound like I'm expecting gourmet quality at that price, but I only ate 1 1/2 dumplings before feeling sick. (Thank you weak stomach) I had read reviews about people poking holes in them in order to drain the pools of oil, but there was just no way of salvaging these massive dumplings of hope.\n\nSitting here now looking at my half eaten meal, I feel like I'm missing out on all the fun. Why does everyone love this place so much? In any case I'm determined to find out. Next time I think I'll try the steamed dumplings.", "author": "Dinah B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-25", "description": "5 stars for the price\n4 stars for the dumplings \n5 stars for the awesomeness of the people running it\n\n\n5 pork dumplings for $1.25?!?

The dumplings are pretty good considering it's not a typical Asian-concentrated area. for $3.50, you get ten dumplings which is slightly more expensive than, say, Vanessa. I also tried the black bean sauce noodles. It was meh. It's edible, but not something I'd order again. This is definitely a cheap place to get some lunch especially for some dumpling fix.

Be forewarned though.... a pretty large sign says $5 for 8 shrimp or vegetarian fried dumplings. I was thrown the first time walking in and just said yes to those. After I opened the menu I realized they have different kinds (pork, chicken,) that were a better value.  I feel a little ridiculous complaining about spending $5 on takeout food (but I want to be able to say I got 10 dumplings for $1.25, darn it!:)  Anywho, they were friendly, fast (waited like 4 min tops.) I also HATE soy sauce but could not get enough of theirs.\n\nTakeout only-no delivery.

Small restaurant with a few really great items on the menu. The woman behind the counter is really sweet.

One day while I was working in the lab at NYU Polytechnic, I came here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!\n\nThe best items on the menu are NUMBER 3 (steamed pork dumplings 10 count) and NUMBER 12 (steamed pork bun). I get them with a can of diet coke or a green tea.\n\nDid I mention it is cheap cheap cheap! At first I was upset when their price went up by a quarter, then I realized I was getting a lunch for the price of a metro swipe!\n\nLimited seating and can be cold during the winter time.

Are they aware this is not Chinatown?  Well, bless their ignorance, for you'll be hard pressed getting a better deal in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\nTheir dumplings have an ample amount of flavorful filling - I usually order steamed pork and chive variety,  since they are relatively healthier than the fried alternatives, and to minimize the waiting time.  \n\nThe steamed large bun with pork innards is a guilty fatty pleasure.\n\nThe sesame pancakes are too oily and greasy for my liking and lack the flavor of the ones I have had in Chinatown.\n\nThey can understandably get pretty crowded, especially during lunch time.
