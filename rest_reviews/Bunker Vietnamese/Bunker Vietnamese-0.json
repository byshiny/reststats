Ordered a summer roll which was full like the sample they have on display yet it wasn't as architecturally sound. It was falling apart before I could really enjoy it. It had a nice flavor and the sauce that comes with it brings it out even more. \nI wish that you got more than one for the price they charge, but I know here in NY summer roll is not as common as pizza so you can't expect to get rock bottom prices... as one would in California. \nI would only come back here to try something a bit more substantive based on the fact that they use hormone free meats and the seafood is wild caught.  For Vietnamese food, this place isn't the cheapest around, but I don't think most can tout that they're hormone free so it all depends on your health choices.", "author": "Kia A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-12", "description": "The pho ga, not only it was tiny, there were less than 1/5 of a chicken breast if I round up. The soup was watery and lacks all the necessary veggie and condiments that make up a pho ga. For the price of $20 something (w/ tax), I would expected to be treated with something decent, not some watery empty garbage you throw in together at some neglected soup kitchen. \n\nA real waste of time and money.

When I'm craving a simple sandwich and there is a Bahn Mi within reach, I'm going to order the Vietnamese delicacy.\n\nBunker Vietnamese is one of the vendors that offers counter seating. There's lots of offerings beside Bahn Mi like Pho (Which I have not had yet) Bunker Vietnamese is also serving spring rolls and cold beer. What impressed me most about Bunker Hill, they use vegetables and meats from local farms and no MSG.

ESPECIALLY when I have to pay more than $10. It literally ruins my day. \n\nI was lured into the $14 turmeric fish banh mi, mostly because I was reminiscing on the grilled turmeric fish banh mi at Violet's Bake Shoppe in Forest Hills, Queens (which is only $7.25). The Bunker banh mi literally tasted exactly like a McDonald's Filet-o-Fish. TRY and tell me otherwise. The bread was meh, the fish was bland and way too fried and the toppings were not on point. Very little cilantro, way too much carrot, not enough of the spices and flavor. WAY too expensive for what you get. WAY. Just walk past it. \n\nMy favorite banh mi joint in NYC is Banh Mi Saigon in Chinatown. I especially loved that spot when it was on Mott St. Violet's had become my go to when I was working in Queens. I haven't yet found anything in Brooklyn. \n\nI REALLY hope that Bunker is not a foray into Vietnamese food for folks. It probably will be though since it's in DMH. \n\nThis is so frustrating. I want to pull the food out and ask for a refund.

I've attempted to give it a try on a couple of occasions, but only successfully ordered once - I had issues with not really knowing where to try to place more order from, which was compounded by the folks working the stall rarely looking up from whatever else they were doing.  When I did manage to place an order, I went with the chicken pho (no other options).  \n\nOn the pros side, I really like that they package the vermicelli in a large container, the broth separately in its own soup container, and the sprouts, basil, etc. wrapped up in a tin foil pouch, but not crunched up.  The portioning all seemed about right, and the broth was still piping hot after taking a walk of a couple blocks before trying to assemble and eat.  They also provide a set up of chop sticks, and disposable soup spoons with a wide and deep head like you'd typically see in an Asian sit down spot.\n\nAs for the cons, the broth really lacks any depth, and there were no condiments like hoisin sauce to help with that.  The chicken is also pretty flavorless and probably could have benefited from a quick sear to get some color and flavor, but seemed to have just been boiled and added to the broth.", "author": "Ryan S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-16", "description": "Worst food I've ever had in New York.

Relatively tiny, about twice as expensive as it should have been, and not terribly flavorful. No hoisin sauce, so I loaded up on sriracha and hot peppers to season it. Decent amount of white meat chicken for the size of the bowl. The menu describes a ginger ale that sounds like they're making it fresh, as I think they do at the main restaurant, but here it's Bruce Coast out of the fridge--luckily I saw that before I ordered it. Definitely won't be getting the pho here again, it's just not worth the cost for an absolutely average bowl of soup.

I spend a fair amount of time eating Vietnamese food and have for the past several years. I found this place overpriced and the quality of the food inferior to most of the Vietnamese restaurants that I eat in.  I started my dinner with a Vietnamese cr\u00eape which was overpriced at $14, it was the twice the usual price I pay in Philadelphia and not nearly as good: it was smaller,  overcooked and tasteless.  For my entr\u00e9e I got their traditional Vietnamese soup with rice noodles, chicken and shrimp, The entr\u00e9e included two small shrimp and over cooked chicken which was inedible. Overall my experience was very negative. The only High Point was the fact it was happy hour and I was able to get beers for three dollars each.
