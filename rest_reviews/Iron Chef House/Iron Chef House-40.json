I've always really liked their tuna teriyaki--good portion size, good quality, tasted quite good, and for a great price you also got a soup and salad.\n\nWell, I don't know what happened, but they overhauled their menu and everything kind of went to shit. The price of the tuna teriyaki increased by around $1--about 20%. No more salad, just soup. The portion I got was tiny and the quality was really mediocre--it was dry, overcooked, and just wasn't that good.\n\nMy coworker got a combination box, and they didn't slice his roll! The waiter brought him a knife, but have you ever tried slicing a sushi roll with a serrated knife? It's near impossible.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I'll be going back.

This 3 roll lunch special is served with the lightest and yummiest miso soup I ever had and with a nice sized side salad too. \n\nI picked the salmon skin roll, spicy tuna roll and the eel avocado roll. The salmon skin roll was the best salmon skin roll I ever had. Most of the time I don't like to order the salmon skin roll because it's too soggy and not crisp enough. The salmon skin was freshly crisped up at Iron Chef House. It was the most memorable lunch I had near the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse. \n\nIt's actually diagonally across the 2,3 subway train station on Clark Street.\n\nNow I have to figure out if I can take a train to Clark Street, get back in time during my one hour lunch.

I came here with two of my coworkers for the lunch specials. It was late and I was REALLY hungry, so I got the sashimi +sushi plate with an extra eel roll, with brown rice. \n\nIt was amazing! I loved the freshness. You know that one \"meh\" sashimi piece one always gets from lower priced sushi joints?

This is the place to go and satisfies greatly! It is close to the train station too. I ordered the seafood curry udon and sweet potato tempora roll. The curry was described to me by my waiter John as spicy as spicy mayo. It gave me the confidence to try it since i only take mild spicy. I really enjoyed the soup. It was creamy and just the amount of spicy i liked. The sweet potato roll was what i expected. Why I give this place 5 stars was to top it off the service was amazing. They gave me a battery pack to charge my phone bc there was no room to put my outlet.

Having had countless amazing sushis in Tokyo, my standards for sushi are quite high...thus, the sushis alone I will give a 3-star.

Delivery is super fast and they are always accommodating, considering where I work. Their sushi is so delicious, particularly the monkey roll which has become my favorite.

Staff is attentive but appears very disgruntled, overworked and underpaid with a extremely weary look.

Choice of hot Green Tea or water is offered. My hot Green tea was invigorating to the senses with fresh loose tea leaves rather from a standard mass produced tea bag.
