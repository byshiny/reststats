He was kind and attentive without being intrusive.\n\nWe thought that the food was way too expensive for what we received. $32 dollars for half a fillet of fish or $18 for a few bites of fideu\u00e1, a noodle paella which was a great tasting dish but served in such a small portion that it made sharing awkward.\n\nOf the dishes we had the fideu\u00e1 was the standout.  A number of the other dishes were just okay. There was even a salt baked fish for which, ironically enough, we had to request salt because it was underseasoned.\n\nI like the fun ideas of the restaurant's menu . It's just that the portions, instead of making you focus on the meal you've had, just make you feel cheated. Not the best feeling to have after a meal.\n\nJust made us long for Curate.", "author": "Alex C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-26", "description": "Nice to have some Spanish here in Brooklyn, but nothing blew us away.", "author": "seth l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-10", "description": "We came here for dinner a couple of weeks ago... and then came back the very next night!

Have really been looking forward to visiting the restaurant as the menu sounded good and the chef has a good reputation.\n\nShared the Sardina  a la antigua, crispy eggplant with honey and melted cheese, croquette of the day, the stuffed rabbit loin and the gurullos. All the food is tasty. The crispy eggplant is orgasmic, the rabbit loin tasty in its simplicity, the pasta comforting.\n\nThe space is nicely designed. white tables and chairs, brick wall, vaguely spanish cut out sheet metal design on the wall. \n\nMy critique: Service was too stiff. There wasn't a warm feeling and the waiter served all food too quickly. He also forgot that our pasta hadn't arrived and had already cleared away our utensils. It was not a welcoming atmosphere; as though the restaurant takes itself too seriously. The tab, including two glasses of wine was $100 before tip. The warm course, the rabbit and pasta dishes, are meant for sharing, and not entree size. So this is a lot of money for grazing food. \n\nI really want to like this place, but it needs to be more for the neighborhood. They haven't cultivated the right service and feel and the prices need to be a more reasonable if they want a regular clientele.", "author": "Serena B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-01", "description": "This is the best Spanish restaurant in NY, in the guise of a neighborhood gem.\n\nSo, beware: it gets crowded and there can be a wait--most good things aren't issued on demand.\n\nFor seating, you want to be at the bar or in the backyard. For a drink, you want sangria or wine by the glass.\n\nFor food, you want to go for the bold flavors--fried chickpeas doused in a smokey paprika, artichokes with an amazing aioli, escalivada with romesco. For entrees, I'm partial to a torn up lamb dish heavy with cumin, preserved lemon, and scallions. Or the suckling pig if it's on the menu.\n\nFor dessert, get the shortbread cake with dates--and ask for an extra helping of lemon curd.

It came in 2s, but knowing how much this costs in Spain, it is definitely a worthwhile delicacy. We also tried the lamb, which was a disappointment. It was smaller than a Mars bar, and wasn't really anything special. The eggplant with cheese was nice but not outstanding. The price they charged for those plates was way too high. I would say, eat here if you have a seafood craving, then finish your meal somewhere else because you won't be full even though your bill will be. Friendly service though!

La Vara is the best small plate restaurant that I've ever been to. Here you get what you pay for, every ingredient is top of the line.

Which by the way I always loved, growing up Ecuadorian, last time I ate it was about 20 years ago! You have to really know how to prepare this meat, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But the result was amazing! If I could describe this meat is close to a brisket type meat, deelish! Then we tried the chicken hearts which again has been a long time since and that was good, the seasoning was more the taste then again chicken hearts don't have much of a flavor. Followed by the fried artichoke w/anchovy aoli dish, very good.\nNoodle Paella was my dish, I enjoyed it but wished I had a bit more fish.  The dishes are small portions.\nPlace is cozy, clean, \u0026 welcoming with hostesses that are friendly and accommodating. Our Waitress Anna was super friendly and knowledgeable on the menu, she guided us well, we would come back just to say hello to her!  \nOh, by the way, the Sangria is probably one of my Favorites I have had at any restaurant, not too sugary, nor too light on the alcohol, just perfect! \n2nd visit:  this time all the tables were full so after saying hello to our friendly Anna we decided to stay and eat at the bar with Diana the bartender mixologist that makes those fabulous sangrias.  She was great too and suggested we try the suckling pig and so we did! \nSuckling Pig dish is out of this planet!! Juicy and tender and please, please, do eat the crunchy top part of the meat or your will miss out on the whole experience.   This has become one of our favorite spots in Brooklyn.

Is that the interview? reading the menu aloud? If it is, it's working.\n\nI came for brunch a few weeks ago with friends and was definitely a fan. I was surprised at how empty the place was, and had my pick of the tables, while the generic-looking cafe next door was overflowing with people. Huh? The menu is interesting in that there is a wide variety of sizes of dishes. Too often, brunch is giant and if you want a smaller, lighter meal, you're stuck with yogurt. I had the poached eggs with artichokes \u0026 lima beans, which were really lovely and a perfect light start to the day. Everyone else's meals were also very tasty \u0026 on the smaller side, so if you're super hungry, be aware. \n\nThe bloody marys were excellent. I would have liked a second, but I guess I didn't ask for it in a Spanish accent. My bad. We also got a pastry that came with quince jam and finished with the churros. I highly recommend those as well - the caramel sauce that came with the churros was to die for. We ate it with our spoons when we were done.

In print, each dish looked vibrant and exotic and refreshingly different from the classic farm-to-table, Southern American inspired restaurants here in Brooklyn.\n\nBoyfriend and I ordered 7 dishes in total, including dessert, so I'd say we gave the menu a fair chance. The dishes arrived in rapid succession--so rapidly in fact that we were done with all 7 dishes in under 30 minutes. \n\nTiny plate after tiny plate hit the table and each one was only OK and nothing more. The huevos de codorniz were difficult to eat and not worth the payoff after all. The aceitunas hit the table strangely late in the procession of dishes, and were disappointing at best (there was no citrus, no herb, just a lot of oil).\n\nThe berenjena con miel had a lot going for it texturally (crispy eggplant, soft cheese) but it lacked salt and the honey was nonexistent. \n\nDish after dish fell flat, notably the fide\u00faa, which my boyfriend (formerly a resident of Spain) was extremely excited to have. The flavor of the noodles was muddled--kind of like what happens when you're trying make a meal from what's left in your pantry and you end up with something that tastes sort of generally savory (hello soy sauce), but has no distinctive flavor.\n\nThe one redemptive dish was a special that night, a cuttlefish stuffed with sobrasada. Finally! A little spice! A little contrast between the tender sweetness of the cuttlefish and the oily crumble of sausage!\n\nIt should be noted that the dishes are sorrowfully small, so much so that my boyfriend suggested that we take photos of each dish with a penny on the plate for scale. \n\nI don't mind small servings, but I was tremendously unsatisfied--and not just because I was still hungry. I couldn't reconcile my menu-induced expectations and my 30-minute-meal experience.\n\nAs we walked out of the restaurant, less than an hour after we walked in, my boyfriend said, \"Let's go get a loaf of bread.\" And we did.", "author": "Hollynn H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-11", "description": "As many have mentioned, the service at La Vara really shines. Everyone working in that restaurant was attentive, friendly, and warm, but not to the point where we felt suffocated. Also, the decor is great.\n\nThe food was pretty good too. We tried a bunch of stuff. \n- Fried artichokes were a (predictable) greasebomb, but the accompanying aioli was delicious. \n- Salt cod salad had a nice texture thing going on, but the flavors were too restrained for my liking. \n- Corn soup (on special) was aggressively sweet and could've used some smoke, spice, or acid to cut through it. \n- Chicken hearts were awesome, but too few on the plate. (6 chicken hearts and a pile of herbs for ~$15? Really guys??) \n- Albondigas were a standout. Aggressive lamb flavor, excellent yogurt sauce. Better savor it though, as you get 5 marble sized meatballs.\n- Sausage stuffed cuttlefish, which was probably our favorite dish of the night, is the only one that I would say is a can't miss dish. \n- Fideua was just okay, a little oversalted. \n- A fig dessert on special was tasty, but it was really just yogurt and figs, which are in season now.\n\nWe also had a couple of glasses of sherry each and a tasty, if unremarkable, bottle of Albari\u00f1o. \n\nI left feeling underwhelmed, particularly after taking the hefty pricetag into account.

Prob healthier. Would've preferred it to be not fried. \nAnd, two specials - raw scallop dish in a sauce and a pane with chorizo. \nThe raw scallop was really interesting. It was tartare-esque with bursts of citrus. The pane w chorizo was good in concept, but we had to request a 3 min egg on top and some fresh ground pepper.

The host said that it would be about a 25 minute wait due to a table taking a while to finish up their meal.  We waited patiently by the bar having a drink while the minutes ticked by.  Enticing appetizers were being shuttled by us and the smell  of the kitchen was fantastic.  after 45 minutes I approached the host, who calmly apologized and said it wont be much longer. 20 minutes later i cornered him and said WTF.  His response was \"Oh...these people were ahead of you\".  I looked behind us and a brand new group of 4 were standing around \"our\" table.  I said to him we've been here for over an hour how can they be ahead of us?  He proceeded to call them by name saying that they have been here forever (obviously friends of his). \n\nAt this point I was ready to curse this guy out and walk out, but Molly the bartender saved the night.   We ended up grabbing seats at the bar and had an amazing experience with the food and wine.

We were not disappointed: different aesthetic vibe to Txikito, but the food was very similar with exquisite tastes and lots of kitchen TLC. I had both a superb cold cod salad (Remoj\u00f3n) and a skate special (what can I say I like fish) and my wife had the delicious daily Croquetas and Garbanzos Fritos to start. We both chose the half chicken (Pollo Asado) which with its cumin was really good. The staff were impressed we polished off two servings. Like at  Txikito the deserts are exquisite in flavor and we had the orange blossom scented date walnut tart, lemon curd, sweet cream (Egipcio) which might have been a dish to many, but it was a birthday dinner after all.\n\nLike Txikito another superb restaurant, where every dish is delicious and served with care.
