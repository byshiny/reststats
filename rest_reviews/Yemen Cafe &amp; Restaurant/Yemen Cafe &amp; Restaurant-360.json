Unfortunately in three years, things have changed a bit. No salad was given with the meal and the portions were much smaller. Also my haneez was supposed to be a lamb shank, but instead I was given some kind of lamb chop instead. The food was still decent, but a bit pricey and not as good as I had hoped.

Before we ordered, he came over, slammed (and I mean slammed, with some authority) a huge round loaf of hot flatbread, some lemons, hot sauce, and two bowls of soup on our table.  When it was time to order, he pretty much just stared at us until we blurted out our orders.  He then screamed our orders back at the kitchen like a drill sergeant.  When we'd almost finished our bread, he just slammed some more on the table, no questions asked.\n\nThe weird part?  I thought it was awesome.  The man was efficient, not rude.  He gave us amazing fresh bread and soup before we even ordered our meals.  Tons of good food before we even order anything?  Hells, yeah!\n\nThe food was great, too.  The haneez (roasted lamb) was ridiculously moist, among the best lamb dishes I've ever eaten... and I'm Greek, so now my ancestors will haunt me forever for dissing Greek lamb.  The roasted chicken and salta (sizzling cauldron of vegetables and fenugreek) is amazing, too.  The portions are obscenely huge, which also makes me happy.\n\nSo Yemen Caf\u00e9 isn't warm and fuzzy, exactly.  I don't care, I ate my weight in fresh bread and roasted meat.  Screw the warmth and fuzziness.", "author": "Charles B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-21", "description": "Amazing delicious food! Definitely recommend this place.

I think anything on the menu is spot on but I would suggest lamb. The yemeni tea is a real treat.

That is saying a lot since it has been a large part of my diet for about 5 years now. The entrees here are hearty and filling and they all taste great, but I could make a meal out of just their soup, hummus, and fresh pita. It is cheap too, and to finish the meal off they serve you some of the most delicious tea I have ever had- it's something like a clove cardamom tea sweetened with honey. I've been going for a while and it is very consistent. The space is shabby, but the top notch food and the diligent waitstaff make up for that. I don't even live near Boerum Hill and I travel up to 45 minutes to eat at this place. Some serious good food going on here.", "author": "Will R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-16", "description": "I just finished my leftover Kibdeh (Lamb liver) from Yemen Cafe ::drools:: \nMost of you cringe at the very thought of liver because you're served some squishy and smelly version of it. Don't worry, their liver is far from such. Think exotic spices, tomatoes and onions- its a celebration in my mouth every time. I hate saying this, but their food is serious competition to my mother's... and we're Yemeni.  \n\nIf you can't make it to Yemen, this is the next best thing. Yemeni hospitality at its finest! Where else will you get soup, salad and hot cardamon sweet tea on the house? \n\nTell the waiter Sideeq the Yemeni from Texas sent you!

I was in the area for trader' joe and went into this restaurant out of curiosity. To be honest, first impression wasn't too good. Yet, their lamb dish is absolutely delicious!! I ordered the Haneez, and it is quite a big portion but still managed to clean the whole plate. I highly recommend to try their salta, I was too full to order that, but it smelled really good from other tables. If you are a fan of lamb meat, this is one place that you cannot miss.

Service is poor as expected. Unfortunately they include service charge (tip) with the bill for their poor service. Even though I love eating Yemeni food if I don't have any options and this would be the only place open I will pass. Sorry but not coming ever again.

The place has a cafeteria feel to it, but that's made up for by the super friendly atmosphere. We came here at about 5pm or even earlier and it was packed, which already tells you a lot. I am not a person who cares about the service component that much but I have to say that the service was very friendly and very genuine without being fussy or overbearing. At the end of the meal, an elderly gentleman, I forget if he is the owner or the chef or the manager, came by and chatted a bit about the meal and the restaurant. The food was fairly simple, but definitely a pleasure. You get a complimentary spiced lamb soup, which is delicious, and piping hot, wonderful flat bread. I am difficult to impress with hummus but the rest of my party said it was awesome and even ordered a second round. Another detail which I hugely enjoyed was that they have complimentary tea which you can serve yourself. I am a tea lover and while I have no idea what exactly is in there, I thought it was delicious. It was quite sweet, which I usually dislike, but here it worked because the tea tasted very strong. Overly strong tea can be not just unpleasant to taste, but can even make me feel sick, but this was somehow balanced. I should go back and ask them how they make it. On to the food. The dishes are not cheap for such a simple place but they are quite big. I ordered the slow cooked lamb and it was a huge piece of lamb, cooked to falling off the bone perfection with great flavor.", "author": "Aliz C."}], "servesCuisine": "Middle Eastern", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Yemen Cafe \u0026 Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "176 Atlantic Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vslOvCtDTQrVpozoKYH02A/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188349533"}
