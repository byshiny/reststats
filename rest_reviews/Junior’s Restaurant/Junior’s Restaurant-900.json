We ordered the cherry cheesecake. We are from Chicago where the food is amazing and honestly this cheesecake isn't all that. Not sure what the big thing was when I honestly think Costco has better cheesecake. And the manager was the rudest person ever, he wouldn't let us sit by the bar and eat our cheesecake. I mean if someone came to my business and bought food there I would be more then glad to service them. He had the nerve to ask \"did you buy this cheesecake here.

The bottom is made of some kind of fluffy cake, NOT graham crackers, and it's so rich and fluffy! What did you put in there?! \n\nI think after having a bite of the cheesecake here, I can never let myself go to the Cheesecake Factory ever again! I can't believe it took me so long to finally check out Junior's here too. I got the Original, which I deem as my favorite. I guess this is what they mean when they said NYC has the best cheesecake!\n\nThe service was efficient when I first ate here with my family for lunch. The waitstaff was friendly for most of our time eating here. The food was alright. It was good but not mind-blowing like the cheesecakes! \n\nI will return for your delicious cheesecakes someday in your other locations, Junior's. As for this place, just check it out!", "author": "Melody W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-10-17", "description": "Food was universally disgusting. I guess they are known for their cheesecake, so if you have a real need for cheesecake in Downtown Brooklyn and you stumble upon this place by accident, then stick with that. Do NOT bother ordering anything else. If our four different dishes are any indication of the quality of the place (and it would seem likely that they would be), you're going to leave annoyed.\n\nEdit: Finally had their cheesecake from some random place in Grand Central. It was overly sweet, overly processed and painfully overrated. Juniors is an abomination. If you like utter disappointment, then this hole is probably your cup of tea.\n\nEdit 2: Ok, they simply have to be paying people to post positive reviews of this turd-factory...", "author": "Benjamin W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "description": "No idea what the hype is about this place. Must have some fantastic marketing I suppose, or maybe it was brilliant back in the day. \n\nGrilled Cheese with bacon and fries. Average at best. No better or worse than 99% of diners could serve up. Could have cooked better myself tbh.  \n\nRaspberry Swirl Cheesecake to go: For a place that is meant to be known for their cheesecakes, c'mon . Barely even average. I'm not one for big chain restaurants, but Cheesecake factory craps all over this. My local deli could probably do a better cheesecake if I had the balls to try it. \n\nLike I said, no clue why this place is as well known as it is. \n\nLocation, location, location I suppose. \n\nService was friendly, hence the two stars.", "author": "J S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-10-23", "description": "Note:\n\nUpdate: 6/16/2011\n\nI had uploaded a photo of the mouse along with mouse droppings found in the cheesecake display...and apparently my photo was taken down. It was flagged as \"inappropriate photo\". Really? Must have been flagged from the owner/managers from Juniors. Hmmm.... Well if you want to see the photos I was talking about, pictures of it was posted on the news channel NY1 news' website here: http://alturl.com/a98c9\nand also on Brooklynian's website, link here: http://alturl.com/a36ox\n\nAccording to the NY1 news...after several photos surfaced the internet about the mice issues found in Juniors, the Department of Health stepped in. Inspectors found evidence of mice in areas of the premises and Juniors was issued several violations. A follow up re-inspection was expected days later...however I'm unable to find any information as to the results of the re-inspection. Watch the follow up video on NY1 news here: http://alturl.com/p5yhf\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPros: \n- None! Nada! Zilch! \n\nCons: \n- There was a homeless man sitting INSIDE the restaurant on the floor begging for change. \n- Mouse was found in the cheesecake display.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy HORRIBLE Experience:\n\nOkay, I had Junior's cheesecake for the very FIRST TIME! The worst first time experience ever! The first thing I noticed when I walked in, was a homeless man, sitting INSIDE the restaurant on the floor by the entrance begging for change. \n\nI came to this place after so much raves from P.Diddy's love for this place being the \"best cheesecake ever\". So I got the chocolate mousse cheesecake topped with chocolate chips to go, which costed $6.75 for one slice. \n\nI got the chocolate mousse cake on Tuesday October 22, 2009 and I was very unhappy when I discovered on the news the NEXT DAY Wednesday October 23, 2009 that there was a MOUSE found in the cheesecake display. I found out about it when my friend posted a picture of it on my Facebook! EWW! Gross!\n\nApparently, I'm not the only one that likes cheesecake! \n(see picture attached) \n\nThey should rename the \"chocolate mousse cake\" and rename it to \"chocolate MOUSE cake\" instead.\nSo does that mean the chocolate chips on the cheesecake weren't really chocolate chips afterall? =(\n\nA video of it was featured on the News on NY1. You can watch the video of it on the news here: http://ny1.com/7-brooklyn-news-content/top_stories/107668/mouse-photographed-in-junior-s-cheesecake-display\n\nYeah....I usually make my own cheesecake. I think i'm going back to just making my own. \n\nLuckily, I only tried a little piece. Once I saw that on the news....I threw the rest of the cheesecake in the trash.", "author": "Arlene F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-18", "description": "A very Southern style restaurant, but a little nauseating if you don't like the smell of fried food.

Frankly the experience was horrible. From the moment we were seated things went badly. The waiter was downright unfriendly. He acted as if he was doing us a favor by serving us. He could barely hide his contempt when we asked him to explain items on the menu.\n\nMy friend ordered chicken dish which he felt  was overly dry and too salty.  I ordered grilled cheese on challah bread. The dish just wasn't that good. I've had better food in random diners across NYC.\n\nI ordered the cheesecake. It was OK.

I always love to try out true Diners with ten page menus. I heard all the stories of how great this place is. PLUS: 1. The condiment tray you get upon sitting down, such a true nostalgic thing. 2. They have the ten page menu 3.The outside has the true old school neon. 4. Yes the cheesecake was all it should be . IF it was a review of just the dessert it would be a 4.5 but the diner experience blew it. ONTO BAD: 1. Ordered a tuna melt, and shall we say, I guess in there eyes a 'melt' means melt the cheese under the heat lamp and the tuna and bread remain COLD.  2. Mom had the French Onion Soup how can it be greasy? 3. The prices are totally touristy and over the top, yea I know it is NY but it's a diner, what it is Brooklyn so it has to be Over the top 4. The server never checked on us once, and we had to flag down anyone to get the check.
