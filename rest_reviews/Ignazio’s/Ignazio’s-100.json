The pizza is good, nice crispy crust, good sauce, great cheese and plenty of fresh basil on top. This is classic NYC pizza, tasty and satisfies a craving but not worth going out of your way for unless you are in the area.", "author": "Jennie A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "First, the Pizza is delicious! I don't know why all the hype with Grimaldi half block away. This place offers amazing authentic Italian pizza with many options for toppings without having to wait one hour in line to get in. We had fennel sausage and mushrooms on our pizza and I was delighted by how tasteful it was. The price was very good and came out to about $30 for a large pie with 3 toppings. \n\nSo, why only 3 starts? Well, first, they do not take credit or debit cards. Its only cash. They do have an ATM inside which charges a transaction fee. Second, their beer selection was limited and third, this place probably has one of the best storefronts in NYC and apparently they are not doing very well in keeping the place up to standards. The restaurant closes very early and the decor is mediocre. Hopefully management will invest more money and improve these deficiencies. Otherwise, if you're looking for good pizza around BK park do not want to waste huge amounts of time elsewhere, go to Ignazio's. You won't be disappointing.", "author": "Miguel R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-10", "description": "My wife and I ignored all of our friends recommendations for pizza in Brooklyn. A local who was on a triumph stopped at a light told us about this place. I asked \"from one triumph rider to another, what's the best pizza around here?\" He said Ignazio's hands down. I'm glad I listened. The pizza was some of the best and the staff was great.

Absolutely appalling customer service. We asked for extra sauce on the side that we never received, the waitress spilled water all over my friend's foot, it took 5 minutes to get extra napkins, the waitress dropped our check without offering dessert or anything else to drink, and then the busser cleared our water glasses before we had paid. On top of all of that, the bathroom was filthy AND it's cash only.", "author": "Andy P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-15", "description": "This resturant is a discrace! I advice everyone to stay away! The food was overpriced and there consideration for customers is zero! We ssked for the ac to be lowered several times and no one made an effort to do anything. I truly never experienced this kind of disturbing service. It was freezing! Everything was blowing around us you could not keep a napkin on the table. We decided to leave ...no one said sorry no one tried to make our stay pleasant . Any other restaurant would have compensated us somehow... this place simply didn't show any respect for its customers.... I regret going and only suggest go to carmine's it's worth the long wait! At least you will be satisfied with the food and know it money was well spent! This place is a joke !

When we called to inquire we were told either cancel the order or wait another 15 minutes. How much better a bad situation would have been had the woman who answered the phone simply offered to take half off, or offered ANYTHING really. Cancelling was not an option. After 2 hours, my kids were beyond hungry and a riot would have ensued.

The basil and oregano all fresh. The tomatoes added sweetness to the sauce instead of the typical acidic after taste .. The light, crispy , airy crust was heaven. And dripping with the pepperoni oil. Omg . We bought the meatball sub because I have to taste a meatball everywhere it's presented on a menu.. Flavorful , not too compact , just my kind of meatball !", "author": "Carol F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-21", "description": "Thin crust, but large, pies and slices. Margherita slice is a true fold and flop NY style slice with chunky tomato sauce, fresh mozz, and lots of basil. White slice is just fresh mozz, olive oil, and lots of garlic.

It's CASH ONLY to just keep that in mind. We got a straight up pepperoni pizza (medium was big enough for 2) and it was delicious! \n\nLeaving out the last star because the service was good but not amazing.

I'm in all how the lady that works at the bar here has such a nasty attitude.  If it wasn't for the somebody from the kitchen ( Javier (super nice guy) sitting at the bar we may have never been asked if we needed help. Hey lady if u don't like ur job leave. The bathroom smells bad but stuff happens lol but no tissue is crazy to me it's basically nobody inside of the restaurant so why aren't the bathrooms properly attended.", "author": "Destiny H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-13", "description": "CASH ONLY but ATM available in the restaurant.\n\nThe original plan was to try pizza in Juliana or Grimaldi's. However, at 2pm we really don't have much patience to wait on the long line for a slice of pizza. We ordered a medium white pizza with mushroom and two sodas, which is the perfect portion for two people. My advice is to eat the first slice asap without burning your tongue. The pizza came out steaming hot, but the first slice was the best. My third slice cooled down already and was not as enjoyable as the first slice. The flavor of the pizza is just right, it's not greasy at all, and it doesn't taste heavy enough that you would feel guilty about it.\n\nI don't know how the pizzas are in Juliana or Grimaldi's.

They will have 5 people cleaning table but no body take order.

The Siciliana Pizza is really delicious! The crust wasn't too hard nor too soft, it had the right crunch to it. The sauce was good too, not too tangy, or too sweet, just in the middle of it with the mozzarella balancing out the flavors.
