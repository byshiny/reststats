You can definitely still tell they're ramping up and don't have a ton of customers just yet.\n\nI've actually never been to a Fresh\u0026Co and had no expectations. I ordered the Santa Fe salad with chicken and it was.... very good. I loved it. I can't wait to eat it again.\n\nIt also looks like they have smoothies, a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls, and some good looking sandwiches. I'd anticipate some odd hours since they're so new. I'd recommend checking with Chelsea Piers before you make a trek.", "author": "Katey G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-01-06", "description": "Just FYI -- you can only go to this location if you're a member of Chelsea Piers, as I learned when I tried to go.
