Nothing green on the menu.  Would it kill them to offer salads?  Our pizza was all right, if a bit wet.  Negligent service.  No wine or beer, and they only take cash.  There would be fewer people on line if there were more food offerings in the neighborhood.

The line was always blocks long - even to get to-go is the same line. It really looked like they have one coal burning oven with limited capacity to make pizzas. They also recently moved and changed owners which might explain the other location that popped up in Manhattan. I never had a chance to try the old place but the pizza here is pretty darn good. Anyways we came about a half an hour before opening and were first in line. Waiting before is way better than waiting in that long line. Anyways they took their sweet time opening up their doors and setting up the line poles. Didn't open till 5 minutes past. Then they have one guy bring in each party one at a time. We somehow got seated in the back and had the hardest time flagging a waiter down when we were ready. We were seated first so shouldn't we be able to be one the first ones to order. I saw at least 7 tickets in the window before we got our order up there. If there's anything that's a pet peeve of mine at restaurants, it's slow and inefficient service. \n\nSo anyways we ordered 2 smalls - one with pepperoni and one with olive and sausage. Each small comes with 6 huge slices so 12 slices for 4 people is a lot. Especially when three out of the four are girls. I think we should've gotten a large (which is 8 slices) and called it a day. The crust is very thin and can be burnt at some places but it's fast to cook and the food came out relatively quick for pizza. I definitely think I'm more of a thin crust fan than a thick crust and this place makes thin crust like the best of them. Quality ingredients too. Pepperoni is small and kinda sparse on the pizza but thickly sliced and so good. Love their sauce and mozzarella cheese. I think I liked their sausage more but the olives were your typical canned olives and these were way to salty to me so it kinda threw off the balance of the pizza. Their sodas and beers are bottles btw. The busboy kept up with clearing the tables quickly but we had to ask for refills on water. And I asked him for the check (only because we didn't spot a waiter for like 15 minutes) twice to no avail. So annoyed that I just ended up walking up to the counter to pay. Should've stiffed them on their tip but whatever. Great, almost perfect pizza but dang their service and long lines prevents them from from getting so many stars.", "author": "Alison W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-19", "description": "The first time I went because it is so highly praised from everyone in the city.

Its story time kids!\n\nWe arrive around 1pm on a sunny Friday afternoon and wait in line for the obligatory one hour or so before ordering 5 large pizzas, probably enough to feed two decent-sized families.  Since it was the first time visiting this glorious place for a few of us, we got to sample an assortment of toppings, including the delicious margherita.\n\nWe decide to park ourselves on the benches with the panoramic views of the New York City skyline across the Hudson, and you just couldn't ask for a better day to do this.\n\nNow, laying out 5 large pizzas on a bench within viewing distance of the ginormous line outside of Grimaldi's is not exactly the ideal position to be in as the caretaker of those pizzas.  Yes, you can definitely see the hunger and anticipation in those eyes; its almost a little frightening.\n\nIt wasn't long before we were approached by a group of girls looking for a slice and my buddy (who was unanimously elected as pizza caretaker by the way - democracy is a beautiful thing) was then put in the position to figure out exactly how many slices and for how much we would be willing to give them up for.\n\nWhile he was busy making the necessary calculations, I was busy coming up with a real business plan of setting up a booth and doing this for real, reselling Grimaldi's, down the block, by the slice.\n\nIt probably wouldn't work, but good pizza and good times anyway!", "author": "Tony L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-26", "description": "The pizza is good.

I would speculate that this is so because the outlet vents of the air conditioning are located only a few feet over the seating area, and as air contacts the thin crust pizza (with minimal olive oil), it diminishes the enjoyment dramatically. (This explains why my family thought I had a brilliant career ahead of me in science, AND why I chose instead to become a banker :D)\n\nEvery tourist to NYC, and indeed his/her unborn child, knows about Grimaldi's for the line of waiting customers extends almost to Times Square. You can come in at any time of the day, and have to wait for half an hour to an hour. Now, I am not one of those who complain about the line, because barring the odd exception ALL great pizzerias in the city suffer from this inevitability. So, all you fine reviewers who trash it by giving it one star on account of wait time, what might the option be, instead? Famous Pizza or Pizza Palace or HooRays Pizza? Please, do go ahead and indulge your senses there.\n\nOnce you are inside, the wait staff will ensure that you get served within 10-15 minutes. Do NOT attempt to make small talk with the waiters. That's not how they rolled behind the Iron Curtain! There's only one consideration here: operational efficiency. \n\nThe pizza is excellent. The coal oven that prompted the Brooklyn location (prohibitions on any new coal oven in Manhattan) chars the thin crust well without burning it. The crust is chewy and smoky while the edges are slightly burnt. The mozzarella to sauce ratio is perhaps the best of all pizzerias in the city, though at times the sauce can be a bit much - with some friends finding it \"soupy\" on their visit. I do prefer the sweeter, herb infused sauce to the competition. However, the wilted basil leaves added little to the taste the few times I've been there. \n\nDo not bring an awkward date here, for the seating is such that you can hear all the conversations around you. In my recent trip, I was seated next to an extremely pompous arse with an even bigger attitude. My heart went out to his sweet natured girlfriend who has to hear the 'shite' continuously. \"I am very difficult to please, but, I like this place. I would change nothing about it. The d\u00e9cor may be shitty and the place may be a dump, but it works. I would change nothing. I am surprised I that I like it.\" He babbled on and on and on in a strong European accent. As I instinctively turned in his direction, the girlfriend looked apologetically at me. To spare her the embarrassment, I glanced over her head and pretended to look at the Frank Sinatra memorabilia on the wall. \n\nMy eyes stopped at a particularly poignant photograph of Ol' Blue Eyes: \"Divorce your loved one with dignity.\" http://www.flickr.com/photos/buhny/15110489/in/photostream/\n\nIs it just me or do you learn something new from Sinatra every single time?\n\nAmazing as Grimaldi's is, the lasting impression would have to be of the Brooklyn Bridge and the view of the Manhattan skyline across the river.

I passed a lacrosse game in progress and watched cars exiting the Brooklyn Bridge. The heat was present but entirely manageable. I met up with a friend who guided me to Grimaldi's. As we queued for our pizza with a line that extended down the block we caught up on his first year of law school, my move from DC to New York and every exciting thing we'd read about food in the past month or so (this passed a lot of time.)\n\nThe grumpy fellow who makes sure you stay in line pulled us out at some point because we were taking our pizza with us. My soon to be 2L pal went inside to order and I waited out on the sidewalk. \n\nAfter queuing for 30 or so minutes and another half hour for the pizza, our number was called. By then I was reaching the end of my rope. Would this pizza be worth the wait? We took our white paper wrapped dinner down to Fulton Landing, which has a spectacular view of the Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline. My mate poured us both a glass of wine from his backpack while I ripped open the package and dug out a slice. \n\nThe pizza, the wine, the view: perfect!\n\nYes, Grimaldi's is indeed worth the wait, but don't bother queuing for a table inside. Get your pie to go and take it down to Fulton Landing to eat. \n\nThis experience will stir up an immeasurable amount of local love in your heart. For despite its difficult, surly ways, New York is one of the most spectacular cities on the planet.

The oven door opens every 30 seconds or so, revealing a huge pile of fiery coals off to the side and the pizza in the back. The temperatures are so hot in this oven that it only takes a few minutes to cook the pizza (reflect on that next time your pie takes 20 minutes or more at most pizza joints).\n\nAs you watch the employees assemble the pies, you might be struck by the fact that the pizzas aren't overloaded with sauce or toppings (a la Round Table). They simply tear off pieces of mozzarella and place them around the pizza, sometimes as much as an inch a part. They do the same with the pepperoni, sausage or other choice toppings and then they simply drizzle (yes..that's drizzle, not pour) the tomato sauce on top of the top of the pie and then finish it with a drizzle of olive oil. \n\nThe pie make look sparse as it goes in the oven, but I think the oven's intense heat breaks everything down quickly, and the cheese, sauce and oil meld together while the pizza cooks. When you get the the finished pizza, there's good sauce and cheese and topping coverage throughout the pie.\n\nWe ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pie (our control when we order pizza) and it was great. The thin crust had a nice crispy char on the bottom toward the outside of the pizza, but was a little softer in the middle, which was nice, and it had a good \"bite\" to it. I liked the bits of sausage a lot and the pepperoni was the smaller, quarter-sized slices that I prefer. But I think the best component of the pie is the sauce. It had a really nice tang to it that went nicely with the cheese and toppings.\n\nWe got there fairly early (before noon), so the line wasn't very long and waited about 10 minutes. Once you sit down and order, the pizzas arrive really quickly. The large pie (18-inch) was the perfect size for splitting with three people, and we took a stroll back to Manhattan on the Brooklyn Bridge to walk off the meal.", "author": "Arnold G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-17", "description": "Great pizza!!!\nworth waiting.\nBut I would not stay there, service not as good as pizza.", "author": "Katie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-11", "description": "We trekked over the Brooklyn Bridge to finally eat at Grimaldi's.
