Brunch was good, if characterized by above average prices. Try the avocado toast: despite having become a cliche, it's worth it. The smoked salmon scrambled eggs are good, but not as much as I had hoped for. Killer Bloody Mary, though!

I highly recommend the chicken and waffles and smoked salmon scrambled eggs.  And to top it off, the caramel apple crisp was out of this world!!!

Went on special occasion (a birthday) and the (great number of) servers were friendly and quite attentive to our small group. Everything we tasted, from Smoked Salmon Benedict and Frittata, to pancakes and fruit, was excellent. They even threw in some extra goodies for us. Got a tour of the soon-to-be-opened rooftop from Elvis Escobar, who was knowledgeable and helpful.  It's a place to which I'd happily return for the food, ambience, and service.", "author": "Joel F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-30", "description": "Went here for the first time the other day and didn't get a chance to look at the yelp reviews.  It was a hot day and a new place so we tried it.\nWe had a glass of wine and ordered the octopus appetizer to share.\n\nThe waitress said the octopus was the best dish off the raw bar even thought it was grilled.  We ordered and if that is the best they have on the raw bar, then that is not a good sign.  The octopus was almost hard to recognize among the beans and it was on top of some mayo based sauce which was not good at all.\n\nI was very happy we did not order a full meal here and just ordered something to try and move on.  I will say the waitress was nice, the view is great but the restaurant was basically empty and now I know why.", "author": "Rene B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-06", "description": "This restaurant is on the ground level of 1 Hotel on Furman street, so there is a grand view of the Brooklyn bridge at most of the tables inside. The bathroom for the restaurant is shared with the hotel as well, so heads up, you'll have to leave and take some stairs to get there. \n\nThe staff was incredible- from host to complimentary coat check, to servers- everyone was on their A game and beyond friendly. \n\nThe food itself was good too, started out with the cauliflower salad, and tried the mushroom risotto as well as the seared scallops.  The cauliflower was cooked just right, still a little crispy and came with grapes and mint with turmeric that that made it a very crisp and refreshing dish. The risotto was bombbbb, very soul-warming on a cold and snowy night.  However, I was glad that we had the scallops as well for a protein and more of a hearty meal to share. The scallops were so buttery they practically fell off my fork and back into the white beans they were sitting on.  It brings a tear to my eye thinking about them now. \n\nCocktails could have been a little more balanced. I had the 'Brooklyn,' which went against all the classic Brooklyn cocktail's ingredients and used rum, but I thought I would give it a try. The lime and bitters did not balance out the sweeter amaro and rum, making the drink fall short and not blend well in the glass itself, where there was some separation. The 'Osprey' was visually appealing with some lavender buds on top, and was a much more balanced drink. \n\n\nI recommend going there for dinner so you'll have a nice lit up view of the city- a great place to bring friends visiting from out of town that's affordable and still has you feeling like a million bucks.", "author": "Amber D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-11", "description": "Came by this evening for an early dinner. We sat outside and whilst the food and cocktails were good, the evening was unfortunately ruined by the children using the outside eating area as a playground - running up and down the rocks and in between the tables where we were eating. Unfortunately, they came out (from their table inside) after we'd ordered, otherwise I would have got up and left like another couple did. Whilst I appreciate they were part of a group eating at the restaurant, we're all paying customers and this should be taken into consideration. At no point did any of the service staff attempt to control the situation.", "author": "Lorna W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-23", "description": "Getting brunch usually means paying a markup for eggs and carbs in exchange for ambience and cute pictures. But I felt like they took it a little too far here, even for NYC. Everything on the menu hovered around the $20 mark. I got the steak tartare because it was about the same price as the omelets and toasts. It was pretty good, but I wish they'd be a little more generous with the bread. The toast was gone by the time I finished about a third of the steak tartare. I waited 10 minutes to ask our server for some extra bread but he didn't come around so I ended up just eating the rest. Probably better for me anyway since I was still full from dinner the night before but having the option would've been nice.\n\nThere are better places to go for brunch if you want a view and ambience. I also wish we got more attentive service for the automatic 20% gratuity that was applied to our bill.", "author": "Cindy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-15", "description": "The location can't be beat unless, of course, it was 12 floors higher! The hotel The Osprey is located in (1Hotel Brooklyn Bridge) is GORGEOUS with a rustic modern vibe. Thick faux fur rugs waterfall down steps, concrete, wood, live walls...it's just gorge. Anyway, becknto the restaurant. The food was pretty darn good. The French Toast bread pudding with lemon curd and berries was kind of a favorite and the egg sandwich on brioche was a close second. I ordered the cauliflower, which was a little disappointing. It was a gorgeous dish, and it was tasty, but I think it lacked a bit. First, the cauliflower is pickled and then roasted. It only needed to be roasted. The tanginess was a little weird. Also, the curry sauce should've either been thicker or something more like curried polenta or sweet potato or something more along those lines. That said, I didn't regret ordering it, but, with every bite, I was thinking of what would make it better. I loved that it was a really healthy option!\n\nThe coffee was a little sour. \n\nOverall, I would totally go back. The service was nice, great ambience (hello, a view of manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge as you step out!) and good, solid food. I wanted to try the cocktails, but it was a little early and I was headed straight to the airport after, but I see some gorgeous cocktails in yelp!

We had a reservation and were seated promptly.\n\nOverall the food was fresh-tasting and well-presented, but also somewhat bland. The portion sizes were decently big for what we ordered. The salmon eggs Benedict was good, but had only a drizzle of hollandaise instead of being doused in it like a typical Benedict. The pumpkin pancakes were huge, with a delicious blueberry topping. The ancient grain bowl had a good amount of bacon but the \"avocado\" was really more like guacamole -- mostly pureed to a liquid/paste with some small chunks of avocado. The chicken and breakfast sandwiches were nice and big.\n\nThe service was distinctly mediocre. When asked what kind of tea they had, our waiter seemed kind of annoyed and said it was on the menu...but it turns out it actually wasn't on this particular menu (Fall 2018 Brunch). Even though none of our dishes needed to be made to order (and all of the poached eggs seemed like they had been cooked hours earlier), it took more than 25 minutes for the food to be served. The waiter didn't ask if we wanted to split the check, and rudely brought it to the table when we were all in the middle of eating (even though there were plenty of extra tables). However there were at least 7 other waiters/servers in the restaurant so it doesn't seem fair to judge the whole place based on this one guy.", "author": "Erin H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-19", "description": "Good hamburger\ngood service\ngood suggestions\ntry and sit outside\nyou get to go one rooftop with receipt from dining here\nThey didn't have the frozen drink, the day I went\n- The frozen drink is apparently the highlight", "author": "renje g."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-20", "description": "The ambiance and service is phenomenal. I know that's probably not the most important part to you guys so let's go straight to the food!\n\nThe scallops entre was delicious and super fresh. The 5 scallops itself were a decent size. We also had the branzino, which was also good. I was disappointed that the duck entre, which was on the website menu, was not on the menu. My friend said the porkchop was the best. I didn't get to try that this time.\n\nThe osprey cocktail was delicious.

It is an absolutely incredible looking space. Every single inch of the building is beautiful. \n\nHowever, the food and service just aren't competitive at their price point. The drinks start at $15 before tax so expect to spend $17 per drink and they are larger than average. \n\nIts NYC I can get past that. I can maybe even get pass the wait staff not being very attentive and forgetting to bring some drink orders. What I cant get pass is how ill conceived the food was. My cauliflower small plate was beautiful but bland. It needed seasoning especially salt. I ordered the Branzino and again a beautiful dish. But the fish was oddly a little bitter, the lentils were forgettable, thankfully the salad on top offered some acidity. No one at my table except for the person that ordered the chicken and the pork chop were wowed. Everyone else was disappointed. \n\nIts not like the food was awful its just if I pay $17 for cauliflower and $30 for fish I am going to be a harsh critic if its not up to par.", "author": "Charles K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-07", "description": "I had a very good breakfast at The Osprey!

I mean, what more could you want being right next to Brooklyn Bridge park with a view of the bridge and Manhattan skyline from the dining room. Restaurant is located within 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge in the back. \n\nAmbiance: Beautiful, chill, and airy. The sandalwood scent they have in the hotel lobby is literally heaven. Feels \"upscale\" without the stuffiness. The numerous plants and wooden beam make for a very zen dining experience perfect for couples or small groups. It wasn't too noisy either so no need to shout to make conversation. Only minor issue was I felt the space between tables was a bit tight. We sat inside as it was way too hot outside when we went.\n\nService: Very good. Our server was personable, prompt for the most part, and helped me out with organizing a birthday surprise for my friend. It was a bit slow getting the check at the end though.\n\nFood: AMAZING! Scallops were cooked perfectly with the MOST luscious grits underneath along with some candied bacon. So good, we ordered that twice. Other faves were the fries (tarragon mayo was bomb) and risotto. Not recommended is the branzino since the char was really overwhelming. \n\nDrinks: Very good. I got the Starling which was fresh, crisp, and well balanced.\n\nOverall: I would come back! They have a gorgeous and spacious patio in the back overlooking the bridge making it a great spot for a relaxing dinner or even apps and drinks with a view. The hotel itself is beautiful and the rooftop is a plus for after dinner drinks (different menu).

Food and drinks are ridiculously good though.  Scenery of beautiful and hip patrons and employees also adds to the mystique of this under the bridge hotel/bar/restaurant. \n\nBrought my mother in law here for mother's day and she had a grand time.  4 star experience that could be a 5 star if...they had more staff on hand  The stand in reservationist at the front gave us sass for moving tables they originally seated us right in front of a concrete pillar where you needed to squeeze into the seating (not everyone is a hipster with a size 30 waist)! Anyhow they gave us 90 minutes to eat our meal and leave since we moved tables but the place never filled up and they never bothered us about it, so why did they bother being Debbie downers to begin with?\n\nThey also ran out of ingredients for their signature Osprey cocktail.  We were able to order 3 and to be honest my guests would have ordered 6 more if they didn't run out of the ingredients, lol. Only one caveat that ribeye or was it sirloin dish had a miniscule amount of steak on it, maybe 4 ounces precooked that shrunk to about 3 ounces. It was a joke compared to the massive 10 or 12 ounce prime rib that was on my plate.  If the steak was prime and expensive then they should be charging more for it for a larger portion rather than serve an embarassingly miniscule portion. I get aged steak all the time from the same purveyor that does caters to Peter Luger, I pay $28 a pound for it.  So $45 for a dinky 3 ounce steak is a joke. Why not charge another $15 or so and have a normal portion?", "author": "Chris C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-25", "description": "Everything we ordered was tasty and the place is as described in the reviews here - bright and airy.
