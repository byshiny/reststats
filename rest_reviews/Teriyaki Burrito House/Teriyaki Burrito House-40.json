I like their recipe, much better than most teriyaki places I have tried.  I can eat this everyday!!!  You get a great meal for under $6...and the servers are fast and friendly.  I would definitely recommend this new hidden jewel (for now) to the neighborhood.", "author": "CanCan C."}], "servesCuisine": "Japanese", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Teriyaki Burrito House", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "96 Dekalb Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/vQiv-eP8RwIYQtAfVX5UKQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187224771"}
