The pizza came quickly, and it was piping hot (they are made in a 1000F degree coal oven and brought right to your table) yet it wasn't dripping oil or cheese like many other hot pizzas. I quite liked how even the plain pizza had basil. I'm not a fan of deep dish, I prefer slightly thinner, yet not limp crusts and Grimaldi's mastered it. Perfect crust, perfect fresh mozzarella and basil, perfect pizza, perfect location. I went there with high expectations after reading all the hype and I wasn't disappointed one bit.", "author": "Vineet S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-06", "description": "this just in...no line at grimaldi's last night at 10pm.  maybe because it was flippin' freezin' or maybe close to closing time.  i only dream of just walking into this fine establishment.  last night was a dream come true.", "author": "Sharlene C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-11", "description": "Hands down the best pizza.

The pizza I had was a small pepperoni with mushrooms and it was soooo good!, another thing I didn't like though is how they only serve bottled soda but meanwhile I saw a soda fountain there so I'm assuming it was broken or they just don't use it anymore for some stupid reason, please serve fountain soda Grimaldi's!!, drinking fountain soda is part of the restaurant experience!. The total cost was like 24 or 25 bucks and change for the pizza, 2 cokes and tip, expensive but you get what you pay for and what do you expect if it's a tourist trap but they got great pizza!.", "author": "Ryan D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-27", "description": "It's good... and a must for the first time NYer .... but does it meet the hype of \"best pizza in NYC\"? well, let's put it this way. if this is the best pizza NY has to offer, stuff yourself with something else...

My friend and I decided to make it a Brooklyn outing day by walking the BK bridge and eating at Grimaldi's.  I've passed by Grimaldi's several times during my time in NY, but having always seen a line, never wanted to wait.  This day, however, I was dedicated.  The line was maybe 15-20 ppl long but it moved surprisingly fast.  Within 30 minutes we had a table.  It's a pretty tiny place inside, so think eating in Chinatown elbow to elbow with random strangers.  My friend and I ordered a small pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  I had high hopes and they were quickly deflated.  The pizza crust wasn't even that thin and it was soggy/runny.  I'm a pretty easy person to please when it comes to pizza as long as it's made right.  I'm not a fan of the runny/watery pizza that you have to eat with a knife and fork because you can't even pick it up.  That is what we were served at Grimaldi's.  Two thumbs down in my book.  Though it wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had in my life, it definitely didn't live up to the hype.  For great thin-crust pizza, I would say head to Luzzo's, Posto, or Lombardi's.", "author": "Grace y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-18", "description": "Waited for an hour and a half one evening just to sample this pizza.

My girlfriend tried to convince me not to go since she seemed to have a vendetta against the place after waiting two hours or something to be seated but i decided to go anyways since it was a Friday afternoon and I thought it would be less crowded. It was and we were seated immediately. I was quite satisfied and preceded to order another small pizza after devouring the large. It was on par with the good pizza places in NY like John's and Lombardi. Prolly not worth the wait but definitely would stop if Im in the area and it is not too crowded.", "author": "Jeremy T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-18", "description": "Best pizza I've ever had, it's true.

And I like to eat here.  My friend and I came here for a late lunch at 2pm, and we still had to wait 45 minutes just to get in the door.  The scarier part was that when we left an hour later, the line was just as long.  The food is worth it, though.  My friend and I finished a large pizza, with room to spare for the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory just down the street.  Another cool thing about this place is that the chefs are behind this glass window so you can watch them make your pizza after you order it.", "author": "Jennifer S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-27", "description": "We took a friend from Los Angeles here about 4 years ago and she STILL raves about Grimaldi's so that should tell people something.
