The pizza is very similar: overly cheesy, solid zesty sauce, dry and crackers thin crust, with a decent amount of char. The pizza isn't bad. Just nothing to go out of your way for. Also had a salad to eat, which was pretty good. The wine I had to drink seemed, unfortunately, to have been open for too long. It was also strangely breezy and cool from the ventilation system.\n\nWould not repeat.", "author": "Michelin F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-20", "description": "Where are my thin crust lovers at? This place is for you! Thin + crispy crust topped with seasonal and fresh ingredients. They also gave a great wine selection. \n\nOh and the ambiance!!!

He was very kind.  The next thing was the decor.  I wasn't  impressed with the taste of what i ordered Penne and vodka sauce  it was ok. Prices  were not high.  Nice vibe in there.  Fast  service too.  Thats about it i don't  think i will return", "author": "Leslie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-06", "description": "Only reviewing for delivery, never eaten in. I want to love this place because the toppings and sauce are amazing, but there's something about the thin crust that just does not hold the toppings in place. Both times we ordered from here, the pizzas came with all of the toppings having slid off the crusts into the corner of the box, where the cheese hardened. \nAlso, one time they majorly messed up our order, bringing us someone else's order, and we asked if they could just quickly take the pizzas we had to the rightful orderer and bring us our pizzas. But apparently once a pizza has been in someone's house you can't bring it to someone else. They insisted on making all new pies, which was nice, but it was hours before we ate. \nStill, it's the only place in the neighborhood I know of that has a good wheat crust and great non-pork meat toppings -- like grilled chicken and all-beef meatballs.", "author": "Olive U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-19", "description": "One of the best thin crust that is very tasty and delicious.

I wasn't gone more than 3 minutes and my leftovers (which was in a to go box) was thrown out. I could almost understand if the pizza wasn't boxed up but if I go out of my way to ask someone to box up left overs they shouldn't assume it should be tossed if left unattended for a couple of minutes. When I asked about it, a server fished it out of the garbage to show it to me, as if I would want it, but didn't offer me any type of compensation. \n\nThe place wasn't very busy and there were only two people working the floor.

I'm sure it will be a neighborhood favorite for years to come. The first time I was there, I ordered the cheeseburger pizza. It was the best pizza I've ever had! Every time I came back, I intended to order something else, but, once there, I HAD to order the cheeseburger pizza. Then, one Saturday, it was no longer on the menu. I still enjoy the thin crust pizza, but PLEASE bring back the cheeseburger pizza.\n\nThe service and wait staff are awesome as well. And the beer is great too!\n\nDid I say before?

The interior of the restaurant was cold beyond words -- you could see people at the bar fidgeting and rubbing their hands together. I get it's summer and you want to fight the heat, but this was overkill. When we asked the host to turn the AC down, he seemed irritated. All said, it took 3 different requests of 3 different waiters for the icebox to melt. \n\nThankfully, the food was on point. We ordered the personal salsiccia pizza, chicken Parmesan, and spinach salad. \n\nThe pizza was very fresh, albeit not incredibly filling for one given the thin crust. So I'd recommend supplementing it with a salad or appetizer of sorts. My sister loved the chicken Parmesan -- she said it's the best she's ever had!\n\nIn all, Brado clearly serves up good food.

Their ingredients are incredibly fresh tasting and loaded with flavor. I usually come here for lunch to get a house salad (which is huge!) and a mushroom slice. It will be hard to find a slice with mushrooms of this quality anywhere else in BK (really, the mushrooms are FRESH, FRESH, FRESH tasting! No canned junk here)!! I'm typically a square-slice gal (and usually cannot stand paper thin ZA), but this place is one of my favorite lunch spots on this end of Atlantic Ave.\n\nDefinitely check out their lunch specials and their happy hour (YAAY to 2-for-1 GOOD draft beer--no sharing, but who the hell would want just one anyway!?)\n\nWhile I have really only commented on the lunch special/happy hour, the reason I am leaving 5 stars instead of four is the staff...not only is the owner friendly, personable and knowledgable, but the folks she has working there are polite, courteous and caring.
