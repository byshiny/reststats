Both have been vital neighborhood assets for roughly half a century at this point. Both of their respective locations are right atop busy Brooklyn subway stops.   This doesn't  simply enhance the classic New York vibe, but crucially it also greatly increases the odds of you getting a FRESH slice rather than a reheated one.  As I have reiterated countless times over the yelp years, you know that I strongly advocate of doing whatever possible to acquire a slice of a pie freshly pulled from the oven, as opposed to one that is reheated after sitting out sometime in the display case.  Some say the reheating it with a pleasing crispness, but I would make the argument it is at the expense of flavor, which for whatever reason decrease at least by 1000x during the reheating process.  The pie here has a nice salty/creamy consistency with a sauce less sweet then many pies across town.  It reminded me of the pie at the UWS's great Sal \u0026 Carmines, and that is always a very very good thing. \n     Like I sid the place is classic NYC, particularly the exterior.  The combination of the vintage sign of the neighboring Chinese is so picture-perfect, you may feel that you have been transported into a  70s Woody Allen film.  Inside the 70s vibe continues with hideously great wood and formica everywhere, showing everyday of its 50 something years.  The staff is efficient as it gets and keeps things moving as well as the pies happily fresh.  This Neighborhood skews older in most senses of the word and stepping in here in particular gives you the small comfort in the fact that in a city, and a world that is constantly changing in drastic and sometimes incomprehensible ways, that some things, and particularly good things manage to stay the same.", "author": "Brendan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "Mini pan pizza, repeat- mini pan pizza. Three little words \u0026 you will die and go to pizza heaven. Where do I begin. Fascatti's- good neighborhood slice joint. Old style plastic booths. A little hot in warmer weather. They have a great system here. The workers- mostly Mexican make the pizza and the owners watch the pies. They use a good, fresh dough here so all slices are \"Brooklyn good.\"\n\nThe mini pan pizza is $7 and made to order. It takes fifteen minutes. You know who makes it and watches it till it's done. It comes out beautiful- deep dish- that is what this is, made just for you. The sauce is a little sweet, the cheese is super fresh and oozing.
