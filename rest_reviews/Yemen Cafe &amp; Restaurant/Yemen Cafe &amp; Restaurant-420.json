I also ordered some sort of bread/honey thing, but the waiter actually brought us something else saying it was better and if we didn't like it he'd bring what we ordered. Glad he did - it was great! (sort of like a bread pudding with honey thing, wasn't even on the menu so I'll have to describe it when asking for it again).\n\nIts a good mix of regulars who the owner goes around and chats with and random other people who are equally as welcome. Definitely has the save overall flavor profile of other middle eastern stuff but with a few different twists. It breaks up the regular kebab/shwarma circuit and offers something a bit different!", "author": "Graham R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-05", "description": "This is an absolute gem of a restaraunt. The best lamb I've ever tasted in my life, I couldn't stop thinking about even after I left New York. Also, the atmosphere is very laid back, and the free tea refills were great.

This was my first experience with yemeni food, so I was expecting it to be somewhat like the food I've tried in Saudi. This place is very authentic yemeni food and huge portions for the prices. This place is worth it for someone who wants to give yemeni food a first-try (this is def better than the other places) and good for people who like yemeni cuisine. \n\nFor me, I just wasn't too impressed with yemeni food. It seemed like a mix of egyptian, lebanese, and Pakistani food and I think somewhere in that mix it became dry and bland. Good luck.", "author": "Asma S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-28", "description": "Try the delicious foul (pronounced, more or less, the way Mr. T would say \"fool\"), a large bowl of hearty fava beans that are stewed with garlic and topped with a drizzle of olive oil. It's served with a large, slightly smoky flatbread about the size of a tennis racket and similar to naan in flavor (though a touch chewier and a wee bit sweeter). The $5 appetizer easily makes a filling lunch.\n\nAlso of note is their zoug, the green Yemeni hot sauce that, I think, might be the single greatest new food item I've tried in at least a year. It's a crisp, slightly zingy mix of tomatoes (just a tiny amount), jalepeno peppers, cilantro, raw garlic, and blended onions that made me think, \"If I could marry a food item, this would be it.\" If you want just a little idea of how amazing this stuff is, try a spoonful of the house soup without it first, and then add a few teaspoons in before your next spoonful.

Im definitely glad I was brought there because their food was delicious. It's decently priced and the portions are huge, enough for two people or for dinner and leftovers the next day.

The roast lamb is BANGIN! the lamb chops were off the hook and the soup was delicious! I've had about everything on the menu and nothing disappoints.

It's like a delicious naan, only tinged slightly more to a middle eastern palate. \n\nFood from the little I've tried has been great-full of spices and flavors. I just took out the shakshouka (pretty much an omlette) and it was mmm mmm good.\n\nMinus one star for the fear factor you kind of feel as a woman walking in there if you're not totally covered. During the day, when I walk here (it's really close to school), it's pretty empty, and there are only a couple of random arab dudes in there-old school arab dudes. This didn't happen to me today, when it was busy and I was also all covered up, but a couple of times that I've been there alone, during a weekday, and in a skirt, I felt kind of uncomfortable.\n\nOther than that-pretty much a great place.

There's not much by way of ambiance, but the service is always very quick and you can take matters into your own hands if needed (feel free to walk to the front and grab some of the complimentary spiced tea from the dispenser).\n\nThey don't have my favorite hummus or eggplant dips, but getting anything as an appetizer is worth it for the huge round of freshly baked Yemeni flatbread that they serve them with.\n\nAs for main courses, you really do need to go with the roasted lamb. The prices have crept up a bit for the dish in the past few years (I think it's up to $16 now?) but you'll get enough roasted lamb for a serious meal, and likely enough to split between two people.

So much to say about this place, where to begin :) Rarely have I had a bad experience. I say the busier the place, the better! Their roasted lamb and chicken pull apart like butter, served on a bed of pilaf or with bread. I've tried pretty much everything on their menu. The hummus with lamb is delicious, as well as most of their slow roasted lamb and chicken dishes. I also love their salad dressing, almost like a spicy, minced garlic chutney which goes great with pretty much everything on their menu. The complimentary spiced black tea is definitely a plus, I always have several cups before, during, and after my meal :) A great place to have a filling meal.

Both were very large and tasty. The curry came with rice. There was more than enough food for the two of us.

If you don't get this place then you're just a dork, and you should be shopping at Sahadi's across the street. \nYes, the complimentary soup is usually salty, and the free tea is WAY too sweet, but those are FREE. \nEverything else is superbly done: from any of the meze, to the salteh, to the fatah. Although lamb is always the favorite dish, I think Yemeni restaurants understate just how well they dominate fish. So don't overlook the fish. It is VERY good! I usually ask to trade rice for bread as an accompaniment. They have their own tanour, and the bread comes out hot and fresh. (I'm salivating already)\nIt is GREAT for brunch. One time I walked in there after a wild night, still with the same clothes I left the house the night before, and had the honey fatah with some Baba Ganoush, and I swear it was one of the best breakfasts I've ever had!\nThe service is good. People treat you like they are happy to see you, and they mean it. The best time to go is around Ramadan, when everybody is breaking fast.
