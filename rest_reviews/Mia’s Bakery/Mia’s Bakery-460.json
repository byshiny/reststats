The salted caramel cake was good; the frosting was sweet and of a thick texture and the cake itself was like a delicious pound cake. The Oreo cheesecake was not overly sweet, which is what we liked. We also purchased a maple bacon version of their cronut, which looks pretty good. \n\nThe whole cakes are decently priced. The pies looked great. Didn't spot a pecan pie, though. I'd definitely come back for the recommended strawberry shortcake. Best part is that I got a free coffee with purchase.", "author": "Timmy Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-24", "description": "Pretty good \u0026 fresh the stuff are very helpful I got strawberry shortcake very nice and light", "author": "Abdelazim W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-17", "description": "BEAUTIFUL SPACE!\nHad the strawberry shortcake and it was THE BEST SLICE OF SHORTCAKE IVE EVER HAD.

Better then any cheesecake in NYC, and I have tried them all. So far I've had 5 different cakes and pastries and all were superb. The gelato was also off the charts. People were very friendly and the place is beautifull including the outdoor patio. It's worth the trip from anywhere to visit mia's", "author": "Steven C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-07", "description": "Mia's Bakery is probably the closest thing to heaven !

Everything I tried was very fresh. I LOVED the creme brule cupcake especially. Not everything was a hit- the Nutella cupcake and the salted caramel cupcake were too heavy, without great flavors. I still feel the best bakery in Brooklyn is Montelleone on Court Street.", "author": "Nancy A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "Went here two times and the service is nice.

Every single item I tried was out of this world. You can taste the freshness.

Everything is fresh and tastes amazing. The only \"bad\" thing I have to say is that sometimes my favorite cupcakes are sold out before I get there! Other than that...this place is the best in Brooklyn and maybe in all of NY itself!", "author": "Sean W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-05", "description": "The cakes we tried were good, but pretty average for the price. The vanilla bean was just OK, and the strawberry cake was pretty good, sweet but light. I wish I tried something more unique or just more variety in general, but we were too full from dinner. However, I like the atmosphere and the surrounding area. Their strawberry tea is actually delicious, and not weird or sugary. The customer service was very efficient and the employees were nice! Granted, I didn't try that much from this place yet, but chances are I'd probably keep trying other places for dessert until I return.", "author": "Jennifer J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-09", "description": "Mia's is probably the best bakery I've ever been to, although I am from a small town and the only place I can get pastries and cakes at is my local Dillon's. I went here for the first time on a recent trip to New York, and honestly got hooked the second I walked in. The bakery had a gorgeous, cutesy setting, it was very whimsical and looked like something straight out of a movie, especially with the outdoor seating, the decorations were well placed, the flowers and plants looked healthy and vibrant, and everything overall had a hipster, sort of rustic vibe, which I expected in The Big Apple. The cakes, tarts, pies etc. have gorgeous colors, an unforgettable taste and will leave you wanting more! I came in here once for breakfast and got affogato with quiche, but then ended up buying six slices of cake, which was completely unintentional. If you want to satisfy your sweet tooth, this is the place for you!", "author": "Tanya S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-19", "description": "Very nice selection of cookies, cakes and pastries.
