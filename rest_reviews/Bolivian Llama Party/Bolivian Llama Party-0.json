Nothing better! \n\nTruth be told I got these from the last Smorgasbord of the outdoor season. I just never got around to praising it's wonders. Oh how delicious these were. The fries were perfectly crispy and that steak didn't have the extra gristle or fat. Just charred flavorful deliciousness. I would definitely try this again.

I had no idea they had another establishment in Brooklyn. My wife loves this place, and I am becoming a fan. We waltz on into this place ( It's a food court) and lo and behold, there was BLP waiting to feed us. She always gets the saltenas... meaning we always get the saltenas. Beef and Chicken and we were good to go. There was an instance where they were making a fresh batch, and it took a while to get it but man it was worth the wait. \n\nOne was cold in the middle though, so I had to take it back. they gave us a fresh one so that was good. Hoping the next trip can get that 5 star rating it deserved.

The Truffle Papitas (fries) were exceptionally good. For the sliders, we got Chicha Chicken, Braised Brisket, and Spicy Lemon Herb Soy Chicken. Everything was tasty, but my favorites were the Spicy Lemon Herb Soy Chicken slider and the Truffle Papitas. I actually forgot that I've ordered from here and got the Truffle Papitas again; the flavor is distinct, so as soon as I tasted them I remembered ordering from here. \n\n4 stars because it's not my go-to spot. It's tasty, but nothing I'm dying to have again. If it magically appears in front of me, I won't say no. I'll actually be pretty happy about it. Their dishes are thought out and executed well, but there are a lot of options nearby that do it just as well. Maybe better.\n\nAs far as delivery, it arrived quickly and my order was correct.

Their food is good, but it just looks sad. This is the second time I've been and gotten a saltena from the hot case next to the cash register. Unfortunately, I've never seen a light on in this case so the food never comes out steamy. On my first visit, I had a chicken saltena, but on this visit, I had to settle for veggie because it was all they had left. The veggie saltena, even though lukewarm, was mindblowing. Think a chewy empanada with a sweet shell and a vegetable stew inside served with chimichurri sauce. Delicious. \n\nI also ordered the cilantro pepitas tossed in garlic, white wine and pecorino with cilantro quilquina sauce. The green mixture and shredded cheese on the fries was just too much for me. I'm more of a traditionalist. Give me some Ketchup and Sriracha, and I'm happy. Their papaya mango drink was very refreshing though. \n\nI'm split - three stars here for me.", "author": "Julia W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-25", "description": "The food was really yummy and fresh but I paid $30 for a pork belly bowl and a brisket bowl and got 2 pieces of meat each.

Both were SO good. It's great seeing what they can do with a full kitchen rather than the little rinky dink ones that the Beach Bazaar supplies vendors with.\n\nThe chicharron wings were amazing. Super crispy. Meaty. And spicy with the Aji sauce (which I have fond memories of from my Peruvian vacation years back).\n\nThe truffle fries were... oh man. I ate them last night, and I think my breath still smells like garlic and truffle. Which isn't a bad thing... unless you're someone around me. But damn they were good. $5 for a small, which actually is gigantic. The garlic aioli really sent that dish over the top.\n\nAnyway, all that to say go to BLP!", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-05", "description": "I've been looking for a Bolivian restaurant in NYC for such a long time, and Bolivian Llama Party finally satisfied my salte\u00f1as craving. I tried their food at their booth at the winter Smorgasburg location, not at the brick-and-mortar restaurant, but my experience at the stand version was great!\n\nI ordered a chicken salte\u00f1as and it was pretty similar to the ones I had in Cochabamba. The filling was rich and salty and there were plenty of tender chicken pieces inside. The outside was sturdy and didn't start to disintegrate from the liquidy filling. It also came with a side of yummy hot sauce. Also, it was only 3.50! \n\nTheir other food options looked interesting--they had lots of sandwiches and elaborate french fries.

Located in the Gotham Market, two failings leave me to give this low rating.\n\n1) Poor operations. They estimated 10 mins for us to get our food, because we had a show to make at BAM. It was about 25 mins from when we started getting the first (not even all) of our meal. I had to gently remind them about our order. The workers said that they were swamped, which I understand happens but why tell us 10 mins? To add insult to injury, they didn't even get our order right. We had an item doubled and then another two items completely missing. We were too rushed to get to BAM to address this.\n\n2) Poor service. When I was trying to figure out what was going on with our order there was no cashier that could answer my question. I then stood at the pick-up area (which as also not clearly indicated) and patiently waited for someone to help me. When no one looked to help me after a couple minutes that's when I had to speak and interrupt and finally get service. Also frustrating, they never made it clear if the food would be delivered to us, if they'd call our name or a number and if I had to go pick up the food.\n\nAs for the food, it was okay, a bit too salty and heavy. I might have gone back for the food but the way the operations and service were last night, I would never come back to a Llama establishment. At least Gotham Market at Ashland was a cool place to chill while we waited for our food...", "author": "Michael C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-24", "description": "Dear Bolivian Llama Party,\n\nThank you for joining the downtown Brooklyn community and feeding us with your delicious saltenas and crowd pleasing papitas. I had my first taste when you had a stall at the Bryant Park Winter Garden, so I was beyond thrilled to have you start up in Brooklyn. I know Gotham Market is still finding it's foothold but I think you're a great addition to the team. Your saltenas really are as good as they're lauded to be. The green sauce that comes with the saltena? Its magic crack. My husband absolutely loves your chicken trigo wheatberry bowl. The papitas (fries) with queso are awesome with sauce.  \n\nEvery time I have come, you have been very friendly and helpful. I know it can be hard to predict the crowds - I've been disappointed twice with sold out saltenas! The last few times you've had them, so I hope the inventory kinks are worked out. This past week, my church completely descended upon you and took your kitchen out like locusts - but we all really loved your food, your calm \"yes, we can help you!\" and your reasonable turn around to get meals on the table. You guys rock. You have style, you have good vibes, and you have the tasty food. \n\nWishing you all the success and fuzzy llama hugs,\nSuanne", "author": "Suanne L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-05", "description": "I cannot stress this enough...

I was hungry so stopped by to see what restaurants were there. This place stood out to me. They had a lot of good options and it was something I had never tried before. I got the chimba verde (I think that was what it was called). It was a sandwich with beer battered chicken, bacon, and sauce. It was absolutely delicious! The chicken was cooked well and the sauce added a little bit of spice. I don't like super spicy but it was the perfect amount of kick. I would definitely eat here again.
