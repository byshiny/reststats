Staff was happy to accommodate to special requests and friendly. This nice place to get a good burrito or tacos. Have to try the homemade red sauce, it is spicy but full of flavor. Small place but it has enough space for a decent sized group. I will come back again for the red sauce and the very fresh taste.", "author": "Derek M."}], "servesCuisine": "Mexican", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Oaxaca Taqueria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "75 Hoyt St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xMXdNVU_qO47PVKYvWGPMw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188555530"}
