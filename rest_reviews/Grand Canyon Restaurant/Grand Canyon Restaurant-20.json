Awesome burgers and omletts. And now a focus also on Mexican food. \n\nSide note:\nLiterally the only thing I didn't love love love about the old Grand Canyon (R.I.P. 2015) was the small gross dirty bathroom. And now the new joint has a nice bathroom. Yay!", "author": "Jason O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-04", "description": "I've lived in Brooklyn my whole life, and a good 22 years of it were spent in Brooklyn Heights. I've eaten at every diner/eatery in the neighborhood but nothing compares to the amazing food at the new Grand Canyon Restaurant. The Mexican food section is a great addition as there aren't any real Mexican food joints nearby. It's authentic and the staff is super friendly. \n\nI ate twice there today. I had huevos rancheros with grilled chicken for breakfast. For lunch I had the chicken parm and my friend had the canyon burger. Everything was delicious. \n\n\nWishing them all the success. I will be back soon and with more of my friends.", "author": "Elaine M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-25", "description": "This is my favorite place to eat some great food. The service is very fast and the food always hot and with a perfect taste, if i was you i would order homemade mexican food or some half pound hamburgers with fries, one of my favorite moments it was when i get my smoothie, OMG!!! you have to try it.", "author": "\u00c1ngel P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-12-06", "description": "Ordered the Cowboy burger with cheese. I was with a few other people eating in. Took a while for the food to come to us. When my burger came it was just a regular cheeseburger. I was expecting something more. So the cowboy burger is basically a regular burger (if you wanted cheese its cheeseburger) plus beans. Thats the difference. It was just ok but the beans were good. The other complaint was they kept playing that Titanic music over and over again since we got in... Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On.", "author": "Brian L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-03-28", "description": "Went to the original Grand Canyon Diner for years and was so bummed when they shuttered. Super happy to see that they've reopened next door to the old place. Nothing fancy, but the service is always friendly , and the new space is spacious and clean. I like their old school burger--reminds me of the hand patted burgers your mom used to make for you at home. As I said, been going there for YEARS, but, honestly, I've ONLY ever had their burger so I don't know about anything else on the menu. 4-stars for comfort food and because I really want to see this place stay open so please go check 'em out for me!", "author": "D W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-24", "description": "We live around the corner and decided to try this because of the good prior reviews. The staff was great. Very friendly and attentive. We ordered two egg dishes and french toast. If you want to be a breakfast spot, a few things need to work. Coffee was cold and undrinkable. The syrup came in small packages, with high fructose corn syrup the top ingredient. The eggs Mexicana included diced jalapenos, membranes and seeds included, like someone not a cook diced them. We really wanted to like this spot. Maybe they're working out some kinks still.", "author": "Anthony J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-10", "description": "So glad to have this terrific place in the neighborhood.

It's owned by a gentleman who used to work at Clark's diner. Needless to say, he is a PRO. Good traditional diner food, try the western wrap or omelette.

I enjoy taking my son here- I order Mexican dishes and he orders pancakes:)  Note: there is a kids menu.  The food is great and the restaurant is so clean and pleasant.
