And, arguably the best cheesecake ever. Junior's has been around for a while and has since become a New York institution, in my opinion. I honestly never eat cheesecake anywhere else because once you've had Junior's you've had best. It can't get any better from here. \np.s. If you've had Veniero's cheesecake before, brace yourself for Junior's.", "author": "Evan M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-12", "description": "They give you alot of food, be prepared to take a doggie bag home with ya.

The Weekday Special is amazing!! I ALWAYS get matzo ball soup, salad with Blue Cheese, broiled sole, broccoli, mashed potatoes with extra potato chips, and chocolate layer cake. I go here so much and I even took 3 co-workers who were in town staying in Manhattan and they loved it. I love how it's so conveniently located near the subway and near the B/Q trains for me!

They give me this weird look that say's \"Ive eaten the cheesecake there but aaaaa nothing else...\" That was all in that long drawn out cali speak that has so effectively gravitated to this great city. That said they should come on down off that high horse for a second and have some chicken and ribs, it's pretty amazing here and for the money it's the best bang for your buck in downtown brooklyn. Everything from steaks to fajitas its all standard and all delicious. Nothing fancy just good portions in a nice throwback atmosphere. One thing everyone should try once in their life is the sandwich on the menu called \"something different\". Moist Brisket on a bun made of fat potato pancakes topped with the juices from the brisket. It is one of my favorite things in the world. Worth a try, nothing fancy but a classic standby thats worth more than just the cheesecake.", "author": "Zach K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-11", "description": "Junior's is the best when it comes to cheesecake....seriously.

Unfortunately, Southern-Fried isn't something to try at Junior's (and, admittedly, in Brooklyn) - and, yes, I admit that the only reason we tried Junior's is because nothing else was open (Happy New Years Eve!).  \nStill, it's an experience: the vast sterility, florescent overhead lighting, razmatazz holiday decorations (glitter-tipped poinsettia! twinkle lights! aluminum garland!), tuxedoed wait-staff, etc.  \nMust admit that the price wasn't that bad - less than $40 for two entrees \u0026 mimosa; plus, a parade of complimentary, off-the-wall nibbles (coleslaw, beets \u0026 cornbread) arrive right when you're seated.  I ordered Southern Fried Chicken; my friend Chicken Fried Steak.  The steak had a better scald to it and it was moister; the chicken was a bit over-cooked - however, while I preferred the steak, my friend preferred the chicken (we agreed to dine together more).  The potatoes were good but tasted a smidge boxy, the corn was delicious.   The service was attentive and the waitress was the most cheerful soul around.  \nIf I ever were to patron Junior's again, it would be late a night, after a breeze on the dancefloor - during that in between time when even the streets seem to be sleeping.  When all you really want is a clean, well-lighted place that feels like a few steps into yesteryear.  When all you really want is a plate of steaming cornbread, mashed potatoes \u0026 fried chicken.", "author": "Cannon H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-13", "description": "OK, now I've always herd that Juniors cheese cakes are good, but that's an understatement.

There food is exactly good. The breakfast is very tasty. If you like pancakes or french toast this is the place to be. There dinners are good but i usually get the Reuben sandwich, it is very good with the side sauce. The chocolate mousse cake is great and if you haven't eaten the cheesecake yet you should be ashamed of yourself for depriving yourself of the best cheesecake in the world.", "author": "Jason J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-28", "description": "Solid my friends... well, depending on what you are going for... but the menu has everything... I mean everything.  My favorite there are the blintzes, but have had great soups and desserts.. oh yes, the desserts.  Very heavy eating, but hey, it's a delicattesen for Christ sake... stop complaining.  Everyone talks about the Cheesecake, and yes, it is the best in the city, but I really am not a Cheesecake fan.  I don't think the pastrami is as good as Katz's or Carnegie, but not many are and definitely still solid meat sandwiches for sure.

I typically frequented it for breakfast or a coffee and pastry (both reliably excellent). Yesterday, I stopped there before going to the theater. I ordered a tuna sandwich on thick Chalah bread. It was below average: the bread was stale, and the tuna salad was definitely also not fresh. The best thing were the FREE pickles, beets, cole slaw. I ate half the oversized sandwich, packed the other half to go and ended up throwing it in the garbage once I got home. No reason to keep it. The service has also declined. In the past the wait staff were much more savvy: matre d didn't alert a waiter that we had just entered: we had to flag one down ourselves. It was not an especially busy time so one could not forgive the oversight on that basis. It was simply carelessness on the part of the maitre d. At the cash register the person taking payment asked how we enjoyed our meal. I told him politely but honestly - we were very disappointed. He looked through us with total disinterest. I would strongly advise people to avoid JUNIORS Brooklyn if you want something other than cheesecake and/or breakfast.", "author": "Dolores B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-20", "description": "Seems like things shouldnt be so expensive.  food was good but nothing spectacular.
