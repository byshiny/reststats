As we were walking by we noticed the long line waiting outside, and a mafia-looking old man (complete with white hair and black turtleneck) signaling the next ppl in line to come in.  \"Must be good\", we thought, and off we went to the bridge to take some pictures.  We came back later, and decided the wait must be worth it.  The ppl standing behind us in line mentioned that the the line that day was actually not that long, that in the summer time, the line goes around the corner, so it should only be about 30 mins, but that it's worth it since it's \"the best pizza in NY\".  Thanks to the big clock in the building across the street, we kept track of the wait time.  40 mins later, we were at the front of the line, not bad.  Except that the mafia man kept skipping the tables-for-2 for larger groups.  So 55 mins later, we finally got sat in a large table for 8, sandwiched between a party of 4 and another party of 2. \n\nWe ordered a \"small\" pizza after browsing around and noticing everyone seems to have ordered a \"large\" that seems way too big.  Turns out, the \"small\" here is like a \"large\" in other places.  The thin crust was delish, perfectly toasted.  The pizza had a lot of flavor.  We noticed that most ppl just ordered the plain regular (tomato, mozzarella, basil) without adding toppings.  We later found out that would have been better, as it's flavorful enough as is.  Surprising to us, we actually finished the whole pizza. \n\nService is OK.  They took our order quickly and the pizza came a few minutes later.  The waiters didn't seem particularly friendly, just busy.  The mafia man seemed to be the owner, and though he seemed scary, he was friendly towards kids and occasionally dropped by some tables to greet patrons.  We were wondering what the long line next to the pizza-making area was for, as everyone seemed to just be watching pizzas tossed and made, and ppl were barely moving.  Turns out, it was the bathroom line as they only have one.  Best pizza in NY?  Can't tell, since we're not locals so we can't compare.  But it was great tasting overall.", "author": "Maria K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "Please avoid this place. There is no reason to pay money for a place that treat you like you are only a dollar to them. We waited in line for more than one hour because we had a baby. The guy in the entrance decided that because we have a baby we must have a high chair(although we didn't need one since the baby was a sleep). He let so many couples who were behind us on line to enter ahead of us just because we \"needed\" a chair and they didn't. Then, we went inside  to another waiting area just to realize that there plenty of high chairs waiting there. Then, the guy told us to wait inside and thar he will call,  just to being ignored again for 20 minutes. Finally, we got a table, but was ignored for more than 20 minutes before someone came to give us water and to take the reservation. At this point, it's was after 10pm Sunday after the rush hour and still there was he service. We complained to the supervisor on the 2nd floor about the service and the guy fron fhe entrence and he told us and that the guy in the entrance is confused and not good for the job anymore and that they feel sorry for him and that's why he is still there. Seriously, this is an answer we received. Obviously, this place don't care about you as a client since this is the worst explanation ever. The Pizza was ok, nothing to tell about. Bottom line, there are so many good places in NYC, so why go to a place that hate kids, only care about your money and treating you really bad?

Yeah, it's tasty, but I was expecting delicious, mouth orgasm pizza.  I've had much better pizza elsewhere; particularly at pizzerias that I did not wait one hour to be seated.\n\nThe pizza has paper-thin crust, which is not my first choice and comes with ZERO toppings, except for a small amount of cheese.  The mozzarella is sparingly placed on the crust in thin slices.  Grimaldi's lost major points here, since I would have had to order extra cheese just  to have a reasonable amount.  Because of this cheese dearth the toppings were not affixed to the pizza and often slid off when I picked it up for consumption.  Also, the crust on three of the slices was too burnt - and I like it a little on the burnt side.\n\nThe antipasti is the redeeming quality here.  It was fresh and delicious.  There was a crusty sliced bread with thick slices of mozzarella, salami and roasted red peppers.  No complaints about that.\n\nJust like Pinks (the hot dog stand in LA) Grimaldi's has an intransigent fan base that fully endorses their overrated product.  I would only condone eating here if you can get seated in less than 15 minutes, and even that seems too long for the quality.

The experience of walking over the Brooklyn Bridge and eating pizza is a necessity when visiting NYC.  You have to line up outside on the side walk.  The line can get long quick so make sure you get their early or be prepared to wait.  Don't plan on a quiet dinner as you the tables are very close together.  Other parties will be just as close as your own, which in my opinion is great.

It was so crazy how many times he told them how beautiful they were in his pseudo italian voice. Ive been all over Italy and he isn't quite the real deal. He then tried to over sell  the house wine...' You've heard of bordeaux. It similar to that' assuming that no one knows that that is not a type of wine but a place where wine comes from. Gimmick!!! It sounds fancy but anyone can get an expensive bottle or a bottle for less than $15 at almost any liquor store! As far as the pizza...it was mediocre...i'm not saying that its bad but its average.

The delicate and crunchy thin crust, the fresh ingredients and very little oil really make it oh-so scrumptious. The food is superb. Now, if I was running things there would be several aspects of Grimaldi's Brooklyn that I would change. First, the decor. Yeah I get it, the place has a rich history. That's great and with all the money they make they should be able to update the decor and make it PRETTIER while keeping all the memorabilia. It's very...plain and old. During the warmer months especially the lines get quite long. I went here for the third time a few weeks ago, and a friend of mine and I still had to wait about 40 minutes.

I didn't care at the time, since Grimaldi's popularity (and hype) precedes itself.\n\nWhen I finally got in front of the line, the host -- an elderly man sporting a black shirt and pants, black fedora, and white suspenders a la Billie Jean -- began flashing numbers with his hands like he was some crazed stock broker at the NYSE...except at the line of waiting people.  At first, I couldn't  tell who he was pointing out, as people quickly scrambled inside like they were panic-stricken cattle.  I saw him give me (or maybe the people in front or behind me) a peace sign.  When I hesitated, he screamed, \"What does this look like?!!?

Yes, I've been to Italy for the absolute authentic grub, and I grew up eating all kinds of pizza, from gourmet restaurants to $0.99 pizzas I found at my local grocery store freezer when I was ballin' on a budget during undergrad.  Upon my first bite at Grimaldi's, I was highly impressed, and by the time I finished off the crust on my first slice, all other pizzas were wiped clean from my memory.  \n\nThis place first came to my attention when I saw a friend post a pic of it on her Facebook status.  Even with a blurry cell phone pic, I asked her \"What the? Where the? How the? That looks hella goooood!\"  I knew this had to be a place to check out.\n\nFirst time I went was a weekday around 1:30pm or so.  The line was around a 35min wait, which is reasonable from what I've experienced on future visits.  The only bad thing was standing in the heat.  NYC's heat wave was nipping at our heels this particular week, and we were all suffering.  To relieve us the friendly hostess scooted the line up as much as possible as to efficiently use the shade from the tree, haha.  The novelty shop next door lets you rent chairs if you really can't stand up any longer, and here's a tip: it's well conditioned in there so rotate shifts with whoever you are with so you don't get heat stroke!\n\nFinally getting our name called, I walked into a large room with the walls adorned with badges of honor that any prestigious NYC restaurant has earned.  This usually consists of certificates of recognition from Zagat or CitySearch, and of course, signed photos with celebrities who've visited.  If you're going with only one person, as I did on my first and second visit, you're seated across from your eating partner, sitting right next to other people who are also sitting across from their friends.  It's close enough to be considered elbow to elbow by some people, but as a 6'0 male, I was still pretty comfortable. It actually adds a nice intimacy to the experience.  I started chatting to the lady next to me who was from Texas with her son.  A new friend who I'll never speak to or see again! But if you get too excited after taking your first bite, you can easily knock over your neighbor's pizza.  On my other visit, I came with two others, so we were sat along the wall where other groups of 3 or larger are placed. \n \nI looked at the menu ahead of time, and my brother and I decided that if we were to wait this long for a pizza, we might as well order the big shebang.  From the wise words of Redman, \"If you're going to be a monkey, be a gorilla.\" And that we were.  We ordered the large, and pretty much ordered half the toppings menu.  We added Pepperoni, Sausage, Ham, Garlic, Olive, Onions, and Sun Dried Tomatoes.  After promptly taking our order, the pizza came out quite fast.  Coming out fresh, and not too hot, it was ready to be eaten ASAP.  I love thin crust pizzas, and this slice fit the bill.  You can use the fork and knife to eat those first few bites, because with that many toppings, the slice is bound to flop over.  But this is easily handled by folding the slice as other natives do.  The toppings are fresh and delicious and the cheese has melted perfectly as shown by the drapes of cheese that connect the slice to the rest of the pie as you place it on your plate.  The crust is the best part.  There definitely is something in the NYC water b/c the crust was thin, crispy on the outside, but somehow maintained a chewy, moist inside.  Best pizza crust I've ever had! I love how the cheese and toppings don't slide off the crust as well. Bite after bite, I couldn't stop, and neither could my brother.\nI thought that a large and all those toppings would be enough to have a slice or two leftover to give to my girlfriend, but we polished that pan off mad quickly.  Loved this place so much I came back one a week for the next 3 weeks.  \n\nOn the proceeding visits, I eased up on the toppings and it actually tasted even better since my taste buds were not overwhelmed.  My only gripe(very very minor!) was how salty the olives were.  My brother is a huge olive/artichoke type of person and he too said these were too salty.  \n\nThis place is legit.  It's set a bar (a very high one) for all pizzas to be eaten from here on out.", "author": "Ry V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-12", "description": "It's good pizza but not worth the hour or so wait.
