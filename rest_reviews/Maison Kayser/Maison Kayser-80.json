I was told the only thing I could get to go was the few (not Cobb) wrapped sandwiches left in a basket. But I could sit down and order one. I asked if I sat and ordered, could I get it to go? No. And it was empty. One guy getting a drink.  Epic fail. Why post a \"to go\" menu if the only thing to go is what is left sitting on the shelf.", "author": "Ruth P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-25", "description": "While I applaud the ambience, the design and the baked goods, I have frequently been disappointed with the service or rather its lack.  Seems to be short staffed and there is typically no follow up once the order is served.  And, at such a high end spot I was not happy to get steam table held scrambled eggs rather than an individually made order, and they were cold!  The accompanying whole wheat \"toast\" is strips of what--cracker?

And today we once again enjoyed their delicious almond croissants, which along with their chocolate croissants are all we've ever had at the Brooklyn location.

I don't think I've gotten one thing here that I was disappointed by. Chocolate mousse - decadent; pain chocolat - yes; pli\u00e9 au chocolate - YAS!; the elephant ear pastry, the cakes, the breads.

Yes it's a bit spendy,  but it's priced pretty much as you would expect for a high end bakery and restaurant.  Between this place and LPQ, this place is better on every count.

The Parisian vibes, the amazing pastries, etc.. but the past few times I've come back to this location for a cappuccino, they have been sub par- watered down espresso, luke warm milk, etc. It's easy to see that most of the baristas, while very nice, have not been trained. That is fine if I'm going to the deli, but if I'm paying $5.17 for a cappuccino, it better be excellent.", "author": "Sally S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "So good. Literally the best almond croissant I have ever eaten. Service was pleasant and they gave free packets of jam and even Nutella if you ask!

Dining solo at 9:05 am. Only 11 tables occupied. (25%?). Took 15 minutes to order a coffee and a pastry. Took another 10 minutes for pastry to arrive cold and coffee to arrive spilled over into saucer.  This place is good for takeaway but a very rude dining experience.  Several other tables suffered from slow service too. Only one who got fast service just ordered from the bus boy who served her before others.

It is like eating chewing gum wrapped in a shell of corn flakes.  \n\nWhile it doesn't always have the imposing crunch of those made by its Parisian competitors, like Djibril Bodian's bakery in the Montmartre district, (baking in France is a blood sport, to be fair) ; Maison Kayser's baguettes are by far - the best I've had in New York.", "author": "crownlfc c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-20", "description": "Best baguette in the city!
