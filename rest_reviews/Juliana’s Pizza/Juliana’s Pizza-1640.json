Same sauce and cheese with maybe a minor alteration in the dough. The difference is the owner, environment and the price/toppings. They charge a few dollars more than Grimaldis for nothing additional. However, they do have more toppings including some gourmet items such as buffalo mozzarella. \n\nI love Grimaldis therefore I love Juliana's. Ill go here till the line starts developing\nwhich I suspect will start to happen during the summer. \n\n4 stars only because they increased the price for the same pizza.", "author": "Nitin R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-17", "description": "GIVE ME MORE MEATBALLS!  Awesome!  Service was good. Pizza was good salad was passable but the MEATBALLS. Perfectly  moist in a delicious tomato basil sauce.", "author": "Sarah C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-16", "description": "Hands down the best pizza we have ever had.  We came about 11:45 on a Friday and waiting only 5 minutes for a table.  Ordered 2 small pies and had leftovers even with 4 people eating.  Excellent flavors, crust is chewy and wood fired, not over sauced or over spiced, just quality fresh toppings on an awesome crust.  I would come every day if I lived local.  Service was fast and friendly, restrooms clean.

We got a large Margarita pizza with two toppings, which ended up being something like $4/slice. Once it comes out of the oven, there's a small timing window before the crispiness goes away, so the first slice was great, but the next one was not nearly as good. Overall, not worth it at face value, and certainly not if you have to wait for it.", "author": "Alan D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-17", "description": "Here now with my wife for the second time.

The white pie with arugula was good, but slightly on the dry side. The website said gluten free, the only gluten free they had are their salads, which are expensive and small. Would be nice to have a gluten free pizza option. Patsy was quite friendly while we waited in line. The waitress was not as friendly.", "author": "Lavender L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-29", "description": "I've only been here once, but I wasn't really blown away by the margherita pizza. Very good, but I've had better elsewhere in Westchester and even NJ. Nonetheless, this is a good spot to grab a bite before walking the bridge.

Found parking right in front of Juliana's and Mr Grimaldis himself stopped us on our way to Grimaldis. So I said why not!!!! BIG MISTAKE:(  took two bites from the pizza and asked for it to go. Walked to Grimaldis and stood on line! I really wanted to like this pizza.", "author": "Khristinah R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-03", "description": "Great pizza and wonderful service.

We had the most delicious pizza we'd ever tasted, and the salad was also very good, and enough for all 3 of us. We ordered the number 4 (with pancetta) but wish we could have tried them all.

This is Original Grimaldi's location with PATSY GRIMALDI back to revive his great pizza and name. Juliana was his mother. The phony on the corner GRIMALDI'S is a franchise and lost their liquor license. The only thing in common with the original is the name.", "author": "bernard l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-09", "description": "I wanted pizza that would bring me back in time. I grew up in NY with the best pizza memories and now I am a visitor of NY. I can't say this pizza met that quest, however, it was delicious. The sauce and cheese were very close to pizza I used to eat when I lived in NY. Again, the sauce was exceptional! The crust is where this pizza loses a star. It was slightly under done. It was crispy on the bottom but not cooked through. You could see and taste the raw dough consistency on the top. If it had been cooked thoroughly, perhaps the oven wasn't hot enough, it would have been a top pizza in my book. \n\nWe went on a holiday Friday afternoon. There was a line to be seated, but it went fairly quick. There was a line at Grimaldi's too. Service was adequate.", "author": "Elsa V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-21", "description": "Best pizza I ever had! Introduced to this place summer 13.
