I love my meat. But, after attending a conference with a couple of staunch vegetarians, they convinced my husband and I to have dinner with them at Wild Ginger. Now, I had really zero (maybe even borderline low) expectations as my experience with vegetarian food has been minimal or just \"meh\" at best.\n\nHowever, Wild Ginger provided one of the best meals I've had in New York! What a surprise!\n\nOur friends and I shared some dumplings and fried tofu: they were divine, and the dipping sauces were super tasty. My hubby and I both ordered a bowl of their version of \"bi bim baab\" which is basically a rice bowl with everything but the kitchen sink on it -- it was incredibly tasty. I enjoyed my entire bowl and it felt hearty and flavourful!\n\nHowever, what blew my mind almost more than the mains were the desserts. We shared a vegan pumpkin \"cheese\"cake that was essentially indistinguishable from the real thing. If I hadn't known we were in a vegan restaurant, I would've thought this was a genuine, rich cheesecake! Then we had some peanut butter \"bomb\" -- it was huge! Actually, the cheesecake was, too, so keep in mind that they don't skimp on the dessert portions.\n\nIf I were in the Brooklyn area again, Wild Ginger would be something on my radar. I encourage everyone to try it out, veggie fiend or not!", "author": "Lea A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-06", "description": "Love the food! The decor, the light, the chill music and service! This is a whole palate/senses experience! For an appetizer we had the Bbq tempeh which had a nice crunch and an amazing glaze (it was crack!) in a bed of greens, which was the perfect pairing.\nI had the Malaysian Curry with soy medallions. Hubby got the Orange Seitan with broccoli. The Passion fruit Lemonade was refreshing and homemade.\nIt was amazing! Everything was impeccably spiced.

The waiter service was fairly good; did have to track him down for some water every now and then, but that was because it wasn't the dinner crowd yet.\n\nWe had the pumpkin soup, which was a nice surprise, and the curry samosas.  They were a little greasy, but a nice take on the Indian appetizer.  We got for the entrees the General Tso's soy protein and the bi-bim-bap.  The general tso's had me SOLD!  I had a hard time believing it wasn't chicken and I had to swear up and down to my colleague that it really wasn't meat.  The Bi-Bim-Bap was a bit too different for me, but my friend liked it; good first time.  \n\nWe washed everything down with a glass of plum wine and shared the double chocolate brownie (ohhh I love you!) and the green tea ice cream.  \n\nWe left happy and still had money in our pockets!

The food just tastes fresh. \nThe entree sizes are not huge, but they are definitely big enough for one person. I like getting a few things and sharing them better than I like getting my own thing. The chicken and seitan type of stuff really tastes like chicken!! Its awesome. \nOf course, you can't leave here without trying the peanut butter bomb. Seriously. \nI love this place too much.", "author": "Sally S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-23", "description": "Ordered delivery. The pumpkin soup is delicious. Whereas most pumpkin soups can be heavy and overly sweet, this one is composed of a light broth that packs a lot of great pumpkin flavor without the density or weight. It's accented with fresh pieces of pumpkin and white beans. All in all, very satisfying and warming on a chilly evening. \n\nI also got the macro bowl. It was solid, but still a far second to Sun in Bloom in Park Slope. It came with garbanzo beans, whereas I would I prefer a more authentic bean choice such as adzuki. The highlight included in the bowl was the hijiki salad. Absolutely delicious. That can also be made overly sweet by some places, and here that was not the case. Will order a separate portion of the hijiki for next time. \n\nOverall, a good spot. Will order again.", "author": "Daniel B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-13", "description": "Great food here. I like the Malaysian Curry and General Tsoy's the best. I'm not vegan and I do eat meat.

They served us a salad that I didn't expect as part of the prix fixed deal I had from bloomspot deal. We requested steamed dumplings instead of the regular fried option on the menu and it was no problem. I liked that they were green, probably made with spinach. I ordered vegetables and tofu with brown sauce and it came just as I ordered, without peppers or onions. The tofu was cooked to perfection, slightly crispy on the outside and firm on the inside. The brown sauce was light yet tasty, not nearly as boring as it sounds.

From the abruptly abrasive greeting at the door to the hastiness of the waitstaff it was pretty much an unpleasant dining experience.\n\nThe waitstaff seemed rather impatient when we were deciding on what to order. There were two waiters serving our table and both seemed like they were in a rush to go somewhere or as if we were wasting their time. So within the first 7 minutes, they approached our table 3 or 4 times. After telling them a few times we needed a few more minutes, they disappeared for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nQuestions about the menu were offered with a quick yes or no as if to say \"Why are you asking? Just order.\"\n\nThe icing on the cake, was when the waitress added a 20% gratuity to my check before I even signed. She tried to tell me it was normal and the computer does it by itself.\n\nI had to explain that I had been to Wild Ginger on multiple occasions before she fixed my check.", "author": "Ant R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-02", "description": "Black Pepper Seitan has me reconsidering my omnivore status.
