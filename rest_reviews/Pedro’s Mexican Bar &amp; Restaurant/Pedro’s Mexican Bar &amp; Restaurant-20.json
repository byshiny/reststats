It has all the options you could want with authentic taste. It's not \"Tex-mex\" bs.\nThe drinks are alright-ish (the margarita pitcher is supper sweet) Definitely one of my favorite Mexican spots hiddden away in dumbo.

Or edible...\n\n\n\nAll of these dishes are catered for white people and also service as well.\n\nMy party of 4 ordered Cuban sandwich, Mexican sandwich, beef enchiladas, and quesadillas.\n\nAll of these dishes lacked in the authenticity and flavor but I was around this area and everything else is so expensive. There is literally nothing to eat in dumbo... (the coffee scene is quite bad as well)\nEverything is overpriced and we sat waiting for food for maybe 50 minutes and that is way too long to make 2 sandwiches, enchiladas and quesadillas. I didn't mind the long wait too much.\n\n\nIt wasn't until I saw a white couple who got their food within 10 minutes.\n\nWe also ordered wings and guac and chips and those were OKAY. Guac was good but it needs to be a bigger portion because I've seen way bigger than this for 10 dollars. The person who ordered enchiladas vomitted and the reviews were right. The food is not fresh other than the avocados. \n\nPlease check your yelp and avoid places like these.\n\nBad service and bad food.", "author": "Jenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-02-17", "description": "Loved the decor and atmosphere, but was super disappointed in the food and the prices for that matter.

Don't go here/order from here expecting anything more than sullen service, crappy drinks made with cheap sugary mix, greasy cheap food, and an overpriced bill. I'm not sure how its survived this long in Dumbo but hopefully it'll be gone soon! Ordered last night after two year hiatus (I am pregnant and wanted enchiladas, fast) and was reminded why we don't eat there. Hard greasy food- the beef in the burrito and tacos was rock hard and tasteless, unseasoned salsas, sloppy delivery with food totally falling apart in its container, and employees then arguing with us on the phone about replacing damaged items and pricing for things that were supposed to be included (rice and beans, as described on Seamless).

The waitress was really sweet, the decor was fun and grungy and the food was pretty good-definitely not the freshest or most exciting Mexican food but totally did the job.  If you're in need of a good, warm meal then this is a great place.

Here's why:\n\n1.). The staff are a bunch of borderline criminals (I'm quite sure some indeed are actual criminals--not panhandlers or jaywalkers but legitimate murderers and serial killers). \n\n2.). The food is blatantly atrocious.  I ordered the mofongo (which is actually a Dominican \"acronym\" for Mother Fu*cker Good).  Anybody that puts a dish on their menu with the MF word in it is well.....a criminal.\n\n3.). Regarding the mofongo.  I ate it.  And then I literally proceeded to fart it out of my anal cavity for the next 3 days.  Hot hole galore. \n\n4.). Back to the staff.  As I was waiting for my mofongo, some loud mouthed waitress/criminal came storming into the bar and advised the bartender/mafia boss that some \"puta c-word\" is sayin' \"her mother effin\" food is cold.  Juan Gotti took it in stride and said to this lovely gem of a person \"you tell her it's supposed to be cold\".  \n\nIn short, this place is a mofongo.  It smells, it's gross, and it will leave you upset for days.  Don't go here and support this placeZ.

Thought we'd get an affordable bite before we waded into the sea of tourist priced nonsense. Boy did we get more than we bargained for! First they had a sandwich board out front that said $6.50 for some lunch special with various meat options. Easy enough. I ordered the $6.50 special from out front - beef. Waitress: \"the special is 7\". I wasn't quibbling over .50 I merely wanted to insure I was ordering the special. So I say the one on the board for 6.50. She walks away, looks out the window at the sign only to return and share with me the sign's wrong: it's $7. Gotcha. I'll have the False Advertising Special of the Day then. Food was about as authentic Mexican as Taco Bell. No less. I've had red beans in Central America. Those, those are chili beans. Flavorless doesn't describe it. Sorry it's a miss on a couple fronts.

The drinks and staff are amazing. The margaritas are made from scratch with fresh ingredients and the bartender is very sweet and involved with the customers. My friends did not complain about their food. So I am guessing it was great. Just heads up the salsa is very spicy. I gave a star off because the prices were off on a few things and didn't make sense such as the difference in margarita pitchers with ice is $15 more and the single drinks were pretty pricey. The setting  is very cool downstairs with lights and low ceilings, u feel the tropical vibe in Mexico.

I lived in New York for 4 years and always walked by Pedro's and thought it seemed super cute. One day towards the end of my time in NY, two friends and I decided to get dinner here. Our service was incredibly slow, the server messed up orders, everything was small-portioned + overpriced, and my friend's ice cream tasted like it'd been in the freezer for months. She and I ordered a burrito to share because it was so expensive, and sure enough it tasted bland and was at least 30% smaller than what we could've gotten somewhere else at half the price. I was shocked when two women told me they were crazy about this place a few weeks later, but then again they were rich gentrifiers living in the area.\n\nBottom line: steer clear of Pedro's if you're looking for decent food or a good time.

Which is why my feet have wandered into Pedro's more often than normal. \n\nI'd already had my sodium fill of deep fried burger and fries earlier that morning and wanted something that I could be proud of. Rice, tomatoes, lettuce you say!\n\nFor some reason, it always seems like a good idea in my head (divey, Spanish-y food in my favorite neighborhood, yes please) until I'm staring at the menu. \n\nI think this place is ideal for a post Brooklyn bridge park beer during happy hour. Very friendly staff, divey space, but the food will leave you longing for more. \n\nI was really hungry that day and hoping to leave rolling out to my stomach's content. I was leaning towards the veggie burrito since it seemed most filling, but the bartender swayed me to his fave 'spinach mushroom quesadilla'. I don't know why I agreed, but I feel like we've all been there at one point. Needless to say I was very much underwhelmed. It was a baby quesadilla with a sad gathering of 'pico de gallo' onlooking from a distance. I ate it r e a l l y s l o w so I wouldn't have to order another entree, while simultaneously drooling over my friend's seemingly generous tacos. \n\nAfter drowning it in salsa, it was closer to flavorful (canned mushrooms and all).

If you are desperate for Mexican food and think \"it can't be that bad\" - you're wrong. I'm actually still sitting at the table as I write this. The service is sub par, we waited 12 minutes for our drinks (two frozen margaritas and one beer in a can). This time is an estimation but was dramatic enough for me to time how quickly our food came. It arrived 34 minutes after ordering- we ordered two taco dinner plates and one quesadilla.  At 26 minutes the server assured us our food was coming. \n\nIt is not packed and we were sat at 4 PM on a Sunday.  The food was below grade Tex mex, lack of salt and over all flavor. I will not return- not even at my lowest desperation's for Mexican food. Id rather take an Uber to a Taco Bell and then an Uber Home and would have a faster, more enjoyable experience.
