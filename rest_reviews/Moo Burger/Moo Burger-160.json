Tis another place that you can frequent for your pound of saintly bovine sinew. Ah that the goodly cow would sacrifice itself so that we could spend our afternoons devouring the heart and soul of the beloved bovine. Of course that is another dish completely, but you catch my drift. The carnivore is the ingestor of life itself. What more life can there be but in the muscle that provides movement. Not that cows move much at all. \n\nWe give them leisurely lives filled with grass munching days to frolic in the open pastures where the only discoloration to the crisp air is their own manure. While we pack ourselves into boxes, big and small, and stalls within boxes. The bosses come around to poke and prod us into submission. Everyday we wonder, \"Will this Friday be my last?\" Given the 45 minute break- Oh Humanity!!!- we hustle morsels of radiated food imitation into our mouths before we are herded back into our boxes and stalls. \n\nSo when the week ends. Give me the soul of the free range. The muscles that haven't hunched before the computer all week. The roasted rump that isn't flattened by the corporate machine. A bit of nature that isn't microwaved. Moo Burger! Moo Burger!

The burgers are great, the hotdogs are great and they have really good strawberry lemonade. If I could, I'd try every burger on the menu. A more family-oriented or family centric place, but not something I particularly mind. At least it isn't a packed house with noisy peeps.", "author": "Aaron C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-29", "description": "Oh, so much mediocrity in this place. I can imagine the owners will be scrambling to have this review deleted shortly. Well, too bad.\n\nSo, I took the advice of my friend and decided to try out MooBurger. I work a few blocks away at another restaurant. With a glut of eateries around here, you'd expect some quality and individuality from each one. Suffice to say, I know decent food and decent restaurants. Not that I want to sound like a snobbish moron but this place is snoozers. \n\nSo let's begin, the decor. With a name like MooBurger, I was expecting something with a bit more kitsch, something with personality and identity. Something with cows! Anything! You have a quirky name! Instead, I was treated to a sterile and cold restaurant that felt unwelcoming. A slab of wooden walls, modernist seating, and plenty of empty tables during the lunch hour. It felt like an upscale hotel lobby in any part of the world. For all the money that went into this design, it easily could have been plopped down in Williamsburg or another trendy part of the city, and nobody would have cared. Completely forgettable. Nothing unique about it aside the fact that it looks like a rejected room from a never built Mies Van Der Rohe building. It should be called 'Modernist Burger'... then I wouldn't have come in expecting something... fun. It seems like it would be a drag to work here.\n\nOnto the staff. There was about 7 or so people working when we got here. A gaggle of cooks and two waitresses. That's alot of people for a place that primarily specializes in burgers and doesn't even do delivery. You're not making lobster here, just fries and meat with buns. It took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive which I deem kind of slow when you have barely 4 other patrons in the restaurant.\n\nThe food. So, my compatriot and I played it safe. We ordered the basic All-American burger with fries. I deem the basic, top of the menu item as the restaurant's de facto item. If it doesn't impress, then cobbling a bunch of gourmet toppings onto it isn't going to make it much better. And foremost, not warranting a second venture.\n\nThe burger's presentation was yet another textbook play out of the bible of boredom. The burger comes on a large tray and the fries sit adjacent in a little frying basket. It's a minimalist display, the tray's size eclipsing the morsels of food you've just committed to purchasing. It sticks with their forcibly modernist theme.\n\nUpon taking my first bite of the All American and totally not worth 9 dollar burger with added purchase of children's size fries, I was plunged into a land of pure, unadulterated... blandness. There was just nothing going on with this burger. Literally, this thing could have been served at a roadside diner in Arizona off the side of a forgotten highway, it just did not bring about any fireworks. Hell, I feel bad for slandering Arizona diners, I'm sure the burgers out there taste like God's gift to mankind compared to this blundering but supposedly organic little meat patty. I feel bad for whatever cow died for this. The fries, in their little wiry basket were also just hitching a ride along on this mediocrity train.\n\nOf course, when you have an empty restaurant, you're always pestered by the waitresses who have to ensure you're doing okay with your tiny sad little portions. They don't have much else to do, so you're forced to just smile, lie, and say 'Yeah, we're good.' constantly, hopefully appeasing them so they can wander back to the kitchen.\n\nUnsatisfied, my compatriot and I just accepted the poor choice in selecting this place as our destination. Defeated, I went to use the rest room. And in keeping with the theme of super dull and impractical modernity, their bathroom has but of course, a sliding door! And yes, as another reviewer noted, didn't latch shut properly and startled the poor girl who caught me on the tail end of my urination session. How about you guys do something really hip and install a real door? You know, one that locks and doesn't slide insecurely? That's pretty modern.\n\nAggravated, I took a dollar back from the tip. My compatriot and I walked back to work, the beginnings of a sickly feeling in our stomachs that lingered the remainder of the day. \n\nSo why two stars? This place is located next to Sam's Restaurant. A hallmark of old Brooklyn. It's a shabby Italian joint that isn't top of the line, heck, it's not even all that great. But you know what, it's lightyears ahead of this jettersetter burger blackhole and Sam's is still stuck in the 1950's with ancient decorations. Both restaurants are opposing middle fingers to each other and I personally will side with Sam's. So when you come here, and there's a long wait for silly pricey little burgers, or maybe you're just second guessing on what you should have for lunch, just head to Sam's Restaurant, skip BooBurger or whatever it's called. Eat real Brooklyn food that doesn't rely on some contrived, pseudo-gourmet modern standards.", "author": "James M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "Good burger.

I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked, and the bison was very overcooked for my liking. It was one of these situations where I thought maybe I am supposed to leave it up to the chef, since this is a chef run burger joint, but I enjoy my meat on the medium rare side. The fries were tiny but I should have known that based on how cheap they were. The staff was attentive but I didn't complain because I was tired and starving after a hike.\n\nThey were also out of elk and ostrich but I am sure that is just part of the newness and it was past typical dinner time on a Saturday.\n\n I think it's cute that the staff wears plaid shirts and enjoyed the 90s rock music. The decor is nice and laid back, the place did not feel pretentious at all.\n\n \n\nI will still return to get the organic meat and am happy they finally opened, even though I wasn't impressed by my first visit, hoping it is better next time.", "author": "Marisa L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-17", "description": "The door slammed. The bell jingled. A sweet little 20-something with cobalt eyes and lashes dripping with mascara sized me up. \"Table for two darlin'?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I replied, looking around the place. To my left was a series of four or five tables each holding between two and six people. This place had a community seating ideology-spit-shined and lacquered up picnic tables take precedent over booths and two-tops.  Not my bag, but some no doubt liked the \"neighborly feel\" behind it. Behind the commune was a backwards \"L\" shaped bar and bus station that separated the main dining area from the chefs working the line with ticket in hand. The crowd was typical for the area: Urban professionals mixed with an occasional creative type, all of who wanted more space but still cherished a quasi-convenient commute to the office. It felt like a local spot but we didn't feel like intruders.\n\n\"Right this way.\" She said as she led us to the back.\n\nWe walked alongside the greased up men in white before we settled into a faux industrial mini-booth. I like the back-I can keep my eyes on things, assess the situation as new information stumbled in or out that drab, dinging door. Our compact booth was set for four. Four teenagers, maybe, not two men. The hostess directed her gaze with those opaque orbs of hers, a subtle but demure motion that told me I should sit. I did. We exchanged smirks before she walked back up front, ready to flirt with the next set of stragglers looking for a greasy slab of beef at this late hour of the night.\n\nI picked up the rectangular clipboard carrying the menu. The center pane was filled with burgers of all types: lamb, bison, turkey, chicken.  If it could be made into a patty it was in that center column of raw meat ready to be grilled at high heat. Along the left, salads: goat cheese, Caesar, Cobb, and Greek. What am I a fucking rabbit? I turned to the loose sheet of paper the hostess had left me, the beer list. Respectable. Odd that there's that hard-as-hell to pronounce brew from Boston, but whatever. It's $6 for a draft, making it the closest thing to a cheap beer I've seen in this baby-stroller boom-town I find myself in.\n\nThe waitress came over. She's got her hand wrapped in a makeshift bandage. I couldn't tell if it's necessary to protect some injury or if it's just an accessory. Either way, she's got a figure to die for.Dames will be the death of me, that's for damn sure.\n\nShe turned to me. \"You guys ready?\"\n\nI glanced up and gave her my order. \"Yeah. Buffalo chicken, sweet potato fries, and a Narragansett draft.\" My colleague does the same and ordered a classic Bacon burger with a side of fried mac and cheese.  She scurried away and passed our order to the cooks adjacent to us. When she returned with my beer, her hip brushed my forearm. This gal knows how to play the game alright; I'm either a mark or match. Either way, I decided to play along.\n\nI turned to the main room and looked around. It's small, maybe the size of a two bedroom apartment in one of those old brownstones that seem to be so popular in the better borough that is Brooklyn. In other words, its 800 square feet, max. Industrial lighting by way of hanging bulbs. The floors are hardwood; the table I'm at is made up brushed metal. It felt cool to the touch. So did the second beer I just downed.\n\nThe food arrived. They gave me a side of maple syrup with my sweet potato fries-nice touch. The buffalo burger came with meticulously shredded carrots and celery in lieu of other items. It's good. Damn good. The waitress came back once we've finished and dropped the check. I paid in cash and gave her a smile on my way out.\n\nAs I opened the door, I asked the hostess if little miss bandage is single. She flashed a coy smile and replied in the affirmative.\n\n\"Well, I guess I'll be seeing you gals again then.\" I said.\n\nThe streets were quiet. It was that special time of night when everyone's settled into their third cocktail at their second bar. As I walked with my colleague in tow down the cool summer street, in the distance I heard a faint bell jingle. Two more patrons ready for a patty. Enjoy gents; it'll be a fine experience.\n\nShould you go to Moo Burger?\nYes. The burgers are well crafted and made with care, the prices were reasonable, and the service was both attentive and attractive.

Went on a nice afternoon and it was not packed at all just a couple of people, as soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. The menus come on clipboards which is cool and then theres a drinking menu also. They serve you a nice glass wine bottle looking and it holds water.\n\nThere burgers are ALL ORGANIC \u0026 NATURAL, where can you find that now and days! Best part is yet to come, we started off with the goat cheese salad which was perfect and I loved how the goat cheese was in a circular shape and fried, so good yummy! I had the greek lamb burger which came with my favorite.. tzatziki sauce, SO GOOOOOOD.  The burger was cooked perfect and I also ordered a side of MOO fries which was chili fries, that was so nice and fresh and loved the kidney beans in it. They offer organic and all natural juices and lemonade, the ginger ale was so good I really liked it and less calories and all natural sugars. I could not complain about nothing!\n\nThe place was super clean, the workers were awesome and either the manager or owner he was great, kept checking up on us and just being so polite and nice, like he really cared about how people enjoyed there food and just being pleasant and welcoming and you know how much of a pain I am with customer service and I could not have been more satisfied! \n\nI will for sure be back here and try the other foods and even a shake because I hear they make some really good ones!

This is our second time dining here. We ordered the Banh Mi chicken burger and Court St bison burger with sides of fries.\n\nMy wife's bison burger was over cooked and when we mentioned that to our server she apologized and immediately offered to send out a replacement burger ASAP. We said sure, and she even let us keep the first one just in case. \n\nMy Banh Mi was pretty food, although I feel like the burger sizes are a bit on the smaller side. The second bison burger came out fairly quickly and my wife enjoyed it much more.\n\nThe fries were pretty good as well. They also had a special of organic corn on the cob dipped in some cheese. My wife thought it was good, I didn't like the cheese very much but am not generally a cheese guy.\n\nAt the end of our meal we asked for the check and were turned down! Our server simply refused to let us pay because our experience was not 100%! Mind you, we did not make a big deal out of the over cooked burger at all but our server truly wanted my wife to enjoy a great burger.
