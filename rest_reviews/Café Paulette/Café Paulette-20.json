I've never been treated so terribly for NO reason. From the moment we sat down, he couldn't wait for us to leave and it only got worse. Quite a shame as we work one block away and live in the neighborhood. It seems they only want to serve customers who look a certain way.

From the moment you enter you feel welcome. It's menu is very French, small but with something on it for everyone. The salads are really fresh and the specials highlight the season. From the fresh oysters to tomato salads or Little gem lettuce salads they all rock. \nCome hungry and you won t be disappointed! \nOn this visit we had a cheese plate with a French Chardonnay and 2 salads to start us off all were perfectly made. We also had mussels and fries which were cooked in a delicious white wine broth worth sooping up with some French bread! And our kids shared the chicken which they polished off. \nThis place is really good.", "author": "Neil G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-16", "description": "Went here for dinner last night.

Visited this morning with my daughter for brunch. She had the Avocado Toast and I had the Omelette special.

It's across the street from Fort Greene Park, which is an off leash dog park until 8am, right when Cafe Paulette opens.

Been there many times and its one of my favorite place for a late and long diner in Fort Greene.", "author": "Aurelien M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "The short story: I have a refined palate and I'd give the food and wine 4.5 stars though I'm not sure I'd be comfortable going back. Unfortunate since I live in the same block with the restaurant.\n\n******************************************\n\nThe Burger Paulette is very good and so is the Vouvray. The music is lovely and the (manager?) came over promptly to tell me about the special and then again later to ask how my food was. The lighting is dim and the ambience is pleasant. There were groups but it is very much a date spot and had I known, I probably would've gone elsewhere. It was packed for a weeknight and in general, and there appeared to be only one other person of color there besides me. Though those two factors didn't really bother me. It was the way I was spoken to upon arrival that I couldn't shake. \n\nShortly after I arrived, a woman approached me asking what she could do for me. I thought it was an unusual way to greet somebody, since people normally say \"hi\" or \"how many?\" or at least smile as a way to seem welcoming. It threw me off so I said, \"I have a table...I mean, I booked a table.\" She laughed at my stumbling over my words, which was off-putting and then offered me a choice of two tables. \n\nI then followed her and after she wiped down the table I chose, I sat down. She had gone for a menu/utensils and upon returning, made some sort of comment like, \"Or you could just sit down\" and chuckled to herself again. It's a small place and it was full/a bit loud so I might've missed something she said but normally if you're standing, it's customary to sit once the table is clean. Based on where the table was, the only place I could've stood was in front of the bathroom and I can't think of a good reason why I should've done that. Either way, I already felt unwelcome and that didn't help. \n\nI made an effort to make the best of it and she was fine after that though it seemed like she was in a bit of a rush to give me the check, which I didn't love. For context, the place had started to clear out by then and there were several open tables. I left right after the people next to me did and they came before me, appearing to have dinner and dessert. I had only eaten half my dinner when she asked if I was done. \n\nI sat next to a man/woman couple and when I arrived, the woman complimented me on my dress, which was sweet and almost made up for the rest of the night. Before they left, the man looked at the woman and said, \"Did you have fun?\" and she said, \"This was our best date ever!\" They looked so happy and seemingly in love. Overhearing this made me tear up because I was able to witness a beautiful moment and because it highlighted how disappointing it was to have such a different experience in the same restaurant at the same time.", "author": "Lanie C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-29", "description": "I been to cafe Paulette several times and find the food to be good and the setting quite lovely. Today however at 5pm I walked in wanting a single late lunch and a coffee. I was tired and did not want to sit at the bar, which was crowded. There are approximately 15 tables there and only one was occupied. \nI asked if I could sit at a table and the host refused. Saying they might have reservations coming in. I said really it's empty. I wanted a quick meal. 1/2 hr at most would I have sat down. It is shocking to me that they had all that space yet refused to seat me. I live in the neighborhood and often pass by thinking I should stop in. I will think twice next time. \nI walked up the road two blocks to Walters. They were bustling and seated me without any question. The vibe was also lively and joyous.
