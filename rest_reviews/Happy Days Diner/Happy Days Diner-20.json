The dinner is not always great but breakfast is pretty good. This is a 24 hour diner located downtown off of Montague Street. A nice little local neighborhood spot. The service is decent they have TVs lots of booths usually pretty available and in the summertime they put chairs outside so that you can people watch as you enjoy a nice lunch. Nothing fancy but a typical diner that you can just enjoy hanging out it", "author": "Yas S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-18", "description": "Service here was wonderful, but it kind of went downhill from there. I ordered eggs Benedict and my son had pancakes with bacon. We also ordered a side of corned beef hash. The hash was disgusting and definitely out of a can. As was the hollandaise sauce that was on the eggs Benedict. My sons bacon was burned and he couldn't eat it. I love the neighborhood and the hours for this place were convenient, but we will not return.", "author": "Nikki S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "No toilet no stars, add toilet still no stars bc the chicken parmisigiana made me sad along w no toilet  also told us to pay w cash while eating which made me hangry", "author": "Syam H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "Don't waste your time here.

I saw Happy Days and immediately went inside and didn't bother to check YELP! It's breakfast... You can't really mess that up... Right??? WRONG! \n\nI ordered scrambled eggs and a waffle... My server was eager to help as there was no one in the diner. My food came out fairly quickly... This should have been a tip off. \n\nI am sent the soggiest, deformed, sad excuse of a waffle I've ever seen in my life. I even went ahead to try it despite its appearance and it was just as bad as it looked...! I paid and left... Never ever will I return. Save your money go somewhere else or if you must eat here don't order the waffle!", "author": "Melanie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "Dis place no good :-( i came here have no good time and was not happy.

Happy Days, in common with many other similar diners is very much in my occasion of sin list. So I went there for breakfast. Twice. And yes, I sinned. Corned beef hash day 1 and bacon and eggs day 2. Massive helpings, including potatoes, good coffee and toast left me full and I resolved never to do it again. Until the next time. The decor is 1950s-redolent with some booths and tables to cater for small or largish family groups.  Wait staff are efficient and friendly and coffee refills generous and frequent.", "author": "David F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-06", "description": "The breakfast here is a bit over priced. It's always a hit \u0026 miss when you order the food can be great or it can be just \"ok\". It seems as if they make up the specials \u0026 prices as they go. For example I ordered a lumberjack to go \u0026 it clearly states on the menu \"All eggs, omelette \u0026 griddle specialty platter items includes a complementary cup of coffee or tea and a small glass of juice\" so after placing my order I ask the manager (who took my order) if I could get the coffee.

Seeing as it's 24 hours I wanted a chicken salad. I had just asked for a to-go container because the chicken was well seasoned. Hence the 2 stars. To my dismay about a quater of the way through I noticed the lettuce was not only dirty (it was not rinsed) but it also had a bug in it! As I looked further I realized that wasn't the only piece. Which means the cook just cut it up and put it on the plate. Who knows what I ate. Needless to say it was not the type of protein I was looking for. When I asked for the manager my request was ignored. I knew the waiter had nothing to do with the cooks actions. They insisted that I pay for unclean food and was not very accommodating considering the obvious extras in my salad.", "author": "Kiki S."}], "servesCuisine": "Diners", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Happy Days Diner", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "148 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KfeVoaMcfXr6iyJm38vFAA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188758361"}
