A reliable choice for bahn mi, vermicelli noodle salad, and pho. Consistently delicious, reasonable wait/delivery time, relaxed atmosphere. A definite in-and-out environment, this is neither a gourmet stop or a particularly authentic experience, but is always delicious and satisfying.

I've tried the classic and the tofu, and both are amazing (the soft, crusty bread definitely adds to this!).

The spicy sauce varies in hotness - sometimes the medium is insanely hot and sometimes it's mild. Oh well, I'm not too picky and the place is so delicious.  It's always busy but they are pretty fast.

Plenty of carrots and delicious sauce included among very large pieces of fried tofu. It was crowded as it was lunchtime but the service was fast and efficient. Will totally get again, along with some delicious-looking Thai iced tea bubble tea!", "author": "Dana E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-17", "description": "I'm quite certain that they raised the price on everything since my visit last summer. $4 for bubble tea and $6 for a pork banh mi?\n\nThey do give you a generous amount of tapioca in your bubble tea, so $4 isn't a complete rip off if you like those balls. It's no Ten Ren though, that's for sure. Also, I suggest avoiding the almond bubble tea unless you know you're going to love it because I was not a big fan. I do like almonds but this drink tasted like macarons and milk blended together. It was way too almond-y...why didn't I just go with green tea or taro??\n\nMy pork sandwich was slightly disappointing this time around. The pork-to-veggies ratio was not right in my opinion, and the pork was kind of weird. Some bites were ridiculously chewy...I feel like I must've gotten screwed with some seriously fatty pieces.

A perfect ratio of bread to meat and vegetables made this the best sandwich. Price is right and the wait time is too little for something so delicious.

My favorite is the classic: roasted ground pork, Vietnamese ham, pate', mayo, butter, cucumber, pickled carrots, daikon radish, and cilantro. The carrots and radish are nice and cruncy, exactly the way you want them to be, and the ground pork is very flavorful without being greasy at all. And the cilantro is so refreshing! They could do with a bit more pate', though. The sardine banh mi is also very good.\n\nWhiteys beware: if you ask for a spicy banh mi, you're going to get a HOT sandwich! Not unbearably hot, but enough to make you cry (beware of the big pieces of jalapeno).\n\nTheir bubble teas (milk tea and flavored tea) are $3.75. I particularly like the honeydew and the taro milk tea.\n\nA final note: I see that the banh mi went up by $0.25 since last month. Do they know we're in a recession...?", "author": "Matteo R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-13", "description": "This place has some really good tasty sandwiches. instantly my new favorite the classic bahn mi.", "author": "Jorge V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-31", "description": "As I continue on my quest for the perfect Bahn Mi, I have decided to try Hanco's, which has the best reputation in Brooklyn, for Bahn Mi.\n\nAlthough the bread was not as crusty as Paris Sandwich Shop, this was a better sandwich.  You have options, so there is a bit of customization.  You can have it mild, medium or spicy.  Of course, with my penchant for chile, I ordered spicy and you can even have it on whole wheat, for an extra .75 cents.\n\nThis time, I ordered the Classic Sandwich, made with ground pork, Vietnamese ham, pate and accompaniments.  Their pickled carrots and daikon (at Paris Sandwich Shop, it was only carrots) was perfectly pickled with the correct balance of vinegar and sugar and added so much more flavor than the carrots that were in my Paris Sandwich.  This had large stalks of cilantro, so it had the freshness I was missing at Paris.\n\nIn conclusion, this filling in Paris's bread would be the perfect Bahn Mi!\n\nRegardless, with a lychee Bubble Tea , with the perfect tapioca consistency, this was a fantastic lunch!!!", "author": "Mireille R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-18", "description": "Pros: Fast, cheap and satisfying good value.\n\nDamn you Hanco,!

Approaching the store I saw a B-grade from the health department but still went inside following my gut (or hunger). I wanted to try something semi healthy and new, so I ordered the vegetarian chicken sandwich with medium spicy option. Included inside the French baguette was the veggie chicken, mayo, butter, cucumber, picked carrots \u0026 daikon radish and cilantro. As far as the spice, they added sriracha sauce (instead of the usual jalapeno peppers that traditional Vietnamese sandwiches add). Overall my experience was positive. They provided speedy customer service and the sandwich was warm and tasty. I will be visiting here again in the near future.", "author": "J.
