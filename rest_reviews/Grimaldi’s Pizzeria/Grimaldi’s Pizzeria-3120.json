As already noted there was a long line outside the place, and you have to wait in it, even if you were ordering take out. I think as others stated, the best way to enjoy the pizza is to order it to go, and walk over to the pier next to it, and take in the lovely view. \n\nAs for as the pizza goes, its was just okay in my opinion. I have to give them credit for the fresh light taste of the pizza it wasn't rich. So it was easy on the stomach. The pepperoni is def the way to go. But at the same time, it was lil too bland. I think its a nice spot to hit up in you are in the area, but I don't think its worth a special trip or the long line. I kinda feel like \"Been There Done That\" afterwards, meaning I would be okay if I never went again.", "author": "Falayn F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-03", "description": "If the line wasn't a 45 minute wait it gets the full 5.  Pizza is different for different people.  For me - this is nearly pizza perfection.  Thin, slightly charred crust, sweet, tangy red sauce, stringy fresh cheese.  The half pepperoni was top notch, not greasy but spicy with a crisp!\n\nIt is pizza love!", "author": "Rob V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-12-29", "description": "Pizza was good but unfortunately a decent portion of it was burnt.  More importantly, the service here was substandard.  We got there about 25 minutes before they opened but no one told us that we should wait in line, and when we came back a couple minutes before they opened, there were at least 50 people waiting in line in front of us.  Also, when we asked for water, it never came until we reminded them, and then our glasses weren't refilled for a very long time and not until we asked.  Finally, we never got our change -- we didn't really want any change since it amounted to a standard 15-20% tip but they should at least ask us and not just assume that they get to keep the change.", "author": "Dinesh M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-15", "description": "Famous pizza.

I was prepared for the long wait and made a lazy Sunday out of it; got there around 2:30pm and had to wait around half an hour for two people -- not terrible. But the pizza was the most mediocre pizza I've had -- the crust was nice and thin but the pizza itself was actually bland and unflavorful. I've never had to add salt to a pizza before but I had to here and even then it was barely salvaged. I don't know how this place has managed to retain its popularity, but I guess with the constant throng of tourists it can survive off people just going there once and never coming back. I sure won't be coming back. There is much much better pizza to be had in New York.", "author": "Fawn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-01", "description": "The line grows quickly, but we called in and the pizza was ready when we arrived.\n\nThe crust has a nice char and chew.  It's an excellent example of the style, though it doesn't break any new ground and I've certainly had better.  The toppings were great.  Fresh mozzarella, spicy pepperoni, salty anchovies, the toppings were on the money.\n\nGlad I tried it.

Blasphemy!\n\nI love this place so much it hurts. Rosario's and Lombardi's are the only ones that can hold a candle to it's perfect brick-oven crisp crust and fresh mozarella cheese \"love\". That's right, I go here to mistake food for love, and I'm not ashamed to say it. \n\nThe view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges is breathtaking.

We asked where they'd gotten it, and the fellow said Patsy's -- just up the street. He said there'd be a line, and that if we wanted a table, it'd be about 45 minutes. When we got there and got in line, we looked up at the sign and said, \"Oh, right! Grimaldi's!\" I'd forgotten we were but steps away.\n\nThe line was long, given that it was a beautiful Memorial Day weekend, but we stuck it out. We even decided not to get takeout but to experience the inside. It's awesome. Tight quarters. Loud with conversation. A line for the restroom, too. And amazing pizza that's just shy of Totonno's.\n\nWe got just a small plain pizza with two mineral waters. It came in about 10 minutes. The sauce is fresh and slightly tangy. And the cheese is wonderful. The crust, while excellent, could be a bit more crusty. That said, C. even ate the heels, which means it was good.\n\nCheck out the other patrons and the wall of Frank Sinatra memoribilia. Supposedly, Sinatra considered Grimaldi's the best pizza, and you can't really argue with that.", "author": "Heath R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-27", "description": "Yiss.  Now, when I leave work on Saturday nights and hop over to the B25 bus and see one million people waiting for pizza...that's crazy.  But last night, I was in DUMBO and didn't want to pay Superfine prices for food.  So I called ahead and found out there was no line.  Some friends and I sauntered over, and were sat immediately.  We ordered some pizza, a waiter asked me if the book he found on the ground was mine (Captain Underpants?  REALLY?!), and we ate.  2 Large pizzas and some soda + tip - ten bucks a person.\n\nGood pizza.  But that waiting thing is CRAZY.\n\nAlso, you can call and order to go and have your pizza in 15 minutes.  You show up and just walk in and grab your pizza.

I had to go and check out  what the hype is all about--alas, disappointed! The sausage was ok. The ingredients were fresh and the enticing basil smell cures all hunger growls. However, for 1 hour wait on line? I had better pizza at Di Fara, Nick's Pizza, and even Lombardi's. They use the same method to prepare their pies, all made with fresh quality ingredients. Sorry, guys.. maybe it takes local \" DUMBO\" residents or \"yuppies\" to appreciate and feed into this hyped up pizzeria. The service was extremely slow. And be prepared to wait at least 30 mins for the order.  And bring cash. No credit cards/debit cards. The trip was not a lost cause, we got the ice cream from Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.

And yes, I'm sure this had nothing to do with my spoiling my appetite with some luscious butter pecan icecream from the adorable place at the end of the boardwalk. \nIt's just - over an hour? Come now, certainly you jest? Yes, the crust is great, and sure the sauce and mozzarella complement each other well...but really? I mean, have you tried Spacca Napoli in Chicago? The pizza may be just a tad pricier, but just as fabulous (if not a tiny bit, dare I say it, better!) and the there's no line in sight. You may wait a while sometimes, but getting a table fast mostly involves only good common sense. Namely, don't arrive at 8 pm on a weekend evening. \nThat's all.
