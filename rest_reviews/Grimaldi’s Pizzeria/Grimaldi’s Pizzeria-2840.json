However, this probably was the best pizza I've had so far.  I thought the service wasn't bad considering that it's a pizza joint.  Once the server took our order our pie came out quickly.  We did 1/2 plain and 1/2 pepperoni.  Both were great.  \n\n*This review doesn't take into account standing in line because my 3 friends and I were seated immediately.  (6:15pm on a cold December Monday)  It strikes me as strange to stand in line for over an hour for pizza in a city with good pizza everywhere.", "author": "Laura B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-12", "description": "not friendly, very bad service I would never go back to this location again, only people that were not friendly during my vaction, never go here if u are in Brooklyn go to the other location. but good pizza", "author": "Jacob R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-21", "description": "Seriously...the best pizza i've ever eaten.

Grimaldi's gets a 5 star from this SF native.  After walking the brooklyn bridge on a Friday afternoon we finally reach Grimaldi's around 2pm.  \n\nHoly crow the line was about half a block long.  After going inside to use the bathroom, I thought it was going to be a 2 hour wait for sure. However 45 min later i was seated.\n\nOrdered half sausage w/ mushroom \u0026 fresh garlic and the other half pepperoni \u0026 anchovies.  My husband and I ate a large pie.  That's 4 slices each.\n\nWhat I lovea bout Grimaldi's is their cheese.  The pizza is super cheesy because they use slices of fresh mozarella instead of shredded cheese.  Also instead of putting the sauce first, they dribble the tomato sauce last on top of the toppings.  Then they top all their pizzas with fresh basil.  Yes, I got all this while waiting in line for the bathroom.\n\nThe menu is really simple with only a few key toppings (pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, garlic, anchovies etc.).  Service was decent.  I would definitely come back, on a weekday, and at a random time to avoid the line.", "author": "Terry D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-06-22", "description": "I used to go to the old Grimaldi's when I lived in Brooklyn Heights.  The sausage pie was the highlight of the menu, but sometimes it came out burnt and other times soggy and undercooked... \n\nI thought that when they moved they might make a change for the better... but apparently they didn't... the line is just as long, thes service is still kurt and you still get rushed out when you are done eating... as for the pizza, it isn't any better than it was in the old space.  I got the margerita this time around and it was pretty bland and the crust wasn't firm enough...

As aggravating as an hour+ wait for pizza is, I refuse to let it affect the rating. It's an experience EVERYONE should try at least once. It really has been the best pizza i've ever had in NYC.\n\nGrimadli's is set up picnic style with cozy tables that can be mixed and matched to support any size group. Walls are lined with photos (signed) of famous celebrities who have stopped in here for food; the selection ranges from Micky Mantle, Frank Sinatra, and Sammy Davis to Miss USA and Michelle Obama.\n\nPizza here is otherworldy good. Everything is made fresh on site, and you can watch the chefs prepare in real time. Pizzas are fired in coal ovens, which aren't even legal elsewhere but are grandfathered in at grimaldis.\n\nAfter the meal the owner came by and kibitzed with our group, sharing jokes and history. He apologized for the wait (a great gesture, even if it isn't his fault) and was genuinely warm and welcoming after what had to have been a busy day in the heart of tourist season.\n\nGreat experience.", "author": "Josh F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-19", "description": "We had to wait outside for about 15 or 20 minutes before being snubbed several times by the old dude who seats people.  The wait was not a big deal, but once seated, the service was pathetic.  Our waiter ignored us for a while before taking our orders and forgot our antipasto (which was not that good once we finally did get it). The pizza was delicious though and the prices are reasonable.\n\nIt isn't Grimaldi's fault, but this place is very touristy which makes it kind of lame.

There was absolutely NO flavor, none, it was disgusting. The pizza only stays fresh for the first slice, afterwards the cheese starts to harden and has the texture of a stale gummy bear and the crust becomes a soggy mess that leaves brown pools of sludge all over your plate.

The first time we were able to walk right in. The pizza was perfect in every way. Crispy, the right thickness, the perfect combo and amount of ingredients. The sauce was created to perfection, almost magic in nature. The second time we visited we waited in line for 2 hours. Was it worth it? Yes. The food was as good as the first time around. Had the 2 hour wait been our first time here, I think we would have given up in search of other nearby pizza. But, knowing is half the battle. Well worth the wait.
