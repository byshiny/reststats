What a dump!  Loud and wrong !! One of the worst dining-- no, that wasn't dining, that was feeding and some animals have had it better.It tasted like a bad frozen dinner. The rubber chicken wasn't even hot; we had to send it back because it was served lukewarm; the plates were returned to us one degree hotter..  The bathroom hasn't been cleaned in years.  We left before we became completely deaf.  They use little plastic cups for water, which the waitress stuck her finger in to separate.  \nDON'T EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR YOUR TASTE BUDS OR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.", "author": "Valerie R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "I was in the area. Starving after this long monotonous meeting and I saw they had a dope lunch special. Plus I could look no further for food. I loved this family business. The staff had great genuine energy, service was fast and with a smile and the food I had was awesome. I had the steak burrito and had them add veggies.

The margs were way too syrupy and the atmosphere is gross. It feels dirty in there (they served the margs in plastic cups and it's in a basement.) The bartenders were nice. The salsa is super spicy (as in the traditional salsa that comes with all the chips).

Pedro's is not helping NYC's cause.\n\nFood is flavorless and overly greasy (and overpriced for what it is - which is sad considering it's not exactly pricey to begin with).  As others have said, Taco Bell is better.

Its been around forever and its run by pretty nice folks, despite some of the negative experience by fellow Yelpers.  Drinks are pretty standardly priced for the area, 6 bux for beer, 9 for margaritas.  You can sit at a table or the bar.

One and done.  We came in to try as we live close and we knew with 2.5 star avg this was \"average Mexican\".  It underperformed even those unlofty expectations.  \n\nFair review of my experience:\n\nPros: Supposedly great margaritas.  Bar that has 2 tvs, can watch the game.  Burrito was serviceable, but meh overall.  Tacos were serviceable but meh.\n\nCons: I went with a party of 3 and sat at the bar, we ordered guacamole to start and got tacos, a burrito, and a sandwich as entrees.  Got beers in bottles.\n\nGuacamole was weak.  Store bought, watery but at least had tomatoes.  Chips were stale tortillas, hard.  Salsa was... some canned taco sauce... no chance home made.  \n\nBeers were stale, like they were in the fridge for 4 months.\n\nFlavor wasn't there, not a lot of mexican spice.  Just didn't seem like kitchen or help was really trying to do anything authentic or special.  A hole in the wall with store-bought and quickly prepared \"mexican\" themed food choices.

They were dry and also unseasoned (which, if prepared properly do not need to be seasoned).\n\nFor $16 for a burrito and a side which took 15 minutes; both microwaved - I'd rather buy an Amy's burrito for $2.50 and microwave it myself.", "author": "Melissa B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-10-22", "description": "Pass it by and head to any one of the better spots just a block or so away in DUMBO.\n\nI'm currently lying on the couch now waiting for my stomach to settle after my meal of Mexican the cheap and microwave way...
