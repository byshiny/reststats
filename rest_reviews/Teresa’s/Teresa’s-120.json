I got the Polish platter and a half order of blueberry blintzs (1 blintz).  The saurkaraut had bacon and mushrooms and was not too sour - it was in fact superb. The pierogies were great as was the kielbasa (although in a very small portion). The stuffed cabbage was more meat than rice and very solid and flavorful.  However, what really bowled me over was the blueberry blintz - it is as good as it gets and the best anywhere in the US. The whole bill was less than $20. Service was neither slow nor fast.

The service is solid, but the food is awful.  I don't think I have had a more disappointing meal in New York.  Never order the eggs florentine - it is bland and served on wonder bread.  How foolish I was to return to this restaurant.  The location is lovely, yet the food is lousy.  Even the coffee is horrendous.  The drinks aren't done well either.  What a shame... I really wanted to like this place because of it's convenient and picturesque location.

My friends and I rejoice!\n\nI been here a totally of three times which each visit seemed like the experience of eating there was going downhill...\n\nThe first time it was awesome. You definitely can't beat the brunch special of $13.50 and their ricotta pancakes (so good). My friends and I really enjoyed our afternoon there.\n\nThe second time a different friend that didn't previously come with me to the restaurant and I came super early in the morning to have breakfast. To my suggestion, we both just got ricotta pancakes, which were of course good. As we had already paid and was leaving, I noticed the waitress made a rude comment how I didn't tip her good enough (because okay, you should be getting a $20 tip on a $8 tab...). \n\nThe third time coming, I was visiting with some friends from California which I was ecstatic to take them out to brunch on the East Coast. While Teresa's wasn't my first option, due to time constraints, I figured it would be the best option. Everything was going good and everyone was really enjoying their food until one of my friend's found a piece of sharp plastic in their ricotta pancakes (which I suggested for them to order). It was somewhat awkward just because my friend tried to play it off and make it seem like it wasn't a big deal but quickly he pushed his food to the side and refused to eat anymore. When I personally brought it up to one of the waiters, they themselves seemed pretty dumbfounded and quickly took the plastic piece away. I am pretty sure if I didn't bring it up the second time, they wouldn't had did anything to compensate my friend.\n\nDuring the last visit, as I was staring at their window, I thought to myself, \"No wonder they have a B grade.\"\n\nFor sure not coming back.", "author": "ML S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-21", "description": "Delicious and inexpensive polish food - pierogies, blintzes (which are huge), borscht, sauerkraut and kielbasa.

My friend and I ordered the \"Brunch Special\" which was delicious and amazingly cheap.\n\nI hat potato soup and eggs florentine.  My friend had a chicken sandwich and borscht. We both loved our dishes! For dessert we had coffee with delicious coconut key lime pie! Our brunch special came with a choice of one drink: bloody mary, screwdriver or mimosa. I got the screwdriver and my friend got the mimosa. Both drink were strong which we liked.\n\nOur waiter was super-nice and made us feel welcomed.

First time here I had the stuffed cabbage and cold borscht soup.  Both were great.  Had it with a side of kasha...a wheat concoction that was very good.\n\nToday had lunch there with the husband.  He had kielbasa and sauerkraut with chicken soup. He said it was great.    I tasted the sauerkraut and am now bugged to figure out how to make it....it was so good.  I had the turkey sandwich...not so great.  It was dry, but the Ukrane borscht soup it came with was hot, not the cold version, and was absolutely delicious.  \n\nDidn't have trouble with the service.

It's so needed here. Where to start? The waitress could smile or say \"hi\" at least once but chose not to, and perhaps she should call out if she hates her job today? Theres no drink menu even though they have liquor which the personality-challenged waitress finds perfectly acceptable (and she won't give any suggestions about what's good when asked). No bread at the beginning even though other servers gave it to their tables and the staff said it should be the norm.  One of our orders came cold and tasteless but the other - and the only reason we sought this place out - was beef stroganoff and apparently it doesn't come with noodles.  Perhaps that should be told to those who order it? But then customer service is not on the menu here so no luck. I can't remember the last time I asked for a manager at a restaurant and left without eating, but today was that day. Don't come to this place - save your money and stay home, give yourself dirty looks and curt answers, and serve yourself old microwaved food.", "author": "Roman S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-07", "description": "I only come here for two things and Teresa's does both very well.\n\n-Pierogies: I prefer the cheese or potato pierogies pan-fried to add crispness and with sauteed onions.
