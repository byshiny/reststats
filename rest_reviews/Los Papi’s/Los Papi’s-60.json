My Papi's is my breakfast and lunch spot. \nA Place where everybody knows your name, even if they have to change it to \"Heey Flaca!\". The only place in the area where you can have pork chops, rice and peas, and steak and tostones for breakfast! Ask for the green hot sauce, who cares what it is, its bangin'. \nMy only issue: The EVER-Y-THING slathered in butter. Just make sure that if you're allergic to butter that you specify, make it CLEAR,NO, i'm SERIOUS! because if you don't you will end up with an order of Butter w/a SIDE of whatever it was you ordered.", "author": "Samantha G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-27", "description": "All I have to say is the roast pork sandwich is really good!! And for breakfast I have to have their homefries!! I just wish they would change the bacon they use because it has more fat then actually meat! Smh but other then that it's a pretty good spot!", "author": "Yessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-05", "description": "I love you Los Papi's.

I got the pork + rice/beans/plantains a couple times and it was solid. I most of all enjoy just the rice/beans/plantains for less than $5, it's huge. While I worked in the DUMBO area I made a solid lunch of that once a week. Very nice fellas who work there, too. FYI: it's very casual inside.", "author": "J T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-29", "description": "I heard good things about Los Papi's and we ordered $100 worth of food for a small event on a Tuesday afternoon. We had called the night before and planned for the food to be delivered by 1pm. When we called because they seemed to be running late they basically just shrugged their shoulders and said they forgot. We were planning on ordering catering from them for a large event in March and but with their lack of professionalism it is unlikely.", "author": "Veronica T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-22", "description": "This is my new favorite lunch spot near my job.  I kept seeing people from my office with delicious looking Spanish food, but when I searched Yelp in DUMBO, I didn't see a thing.  Technically they are in Vinegar Hill, which is an extra block away from the office, but it doesn't matter where they are since the food is great.  And cheap!  A small order of pernil, rice and beans, maduros, and fresh bread for only $6.50.  I don't even want to think about how big their \"large\" portions are - the small filled up an 8\" round tin to the brim.  I wish there were slightly less rice and more of the other items, but for the money it's not bad at all.  I still had enough food to be stuffed two days straight.  I even had coworkers eyeing my leftovers I finished up today.  Will definitely be back to try some of their other items.", "author": "Rebecca G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "If you are looking for upwards of 1kg in your stomach at lunchtime, this is your spot in Dumbo.  The people are very friendly and they have a pretty decent spread of food.

It's like a neighborhood criola joint. Roast pork, beef steak, oxtail, plantains, beans, etc. You basically get a mound of food for not too much $. And they don't give you attitude either! I especially like how the menu on the wall has things like burgers and pizza on it. Has anyone tried to order burgers here? I wouldn't.", "author": "Jon S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-07-05", "description": "What Los Papis lacks in decor it more than makes up for it with its hearty Dominican soul food. The standout dish is the shrimp, served only on Fridays.  Baked chicken, steak, and roast pork are also good. Ask for cilantro and green hot sauce on your food. If you're into coconut, try one of the coconut candies next to the cash register. They look like macaroons but they're pure coconut. The guys who work here are the nicest people in the world.
