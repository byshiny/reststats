I have spent a lot of time in Hawaii.  Every time I come back to New York, I get homesick for some Poke.  And I've tried a bunch of Poke places in the city.  This is the best.  I ordered the spicy tuna over salad.  The tuna was not overly mayo'd and the flavor was spot on.   Their fish is super fresh.  I want to try everything on their menu!", "author": "Lisa C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-06", "description": "A cute little place to curb some pok\u00e9 cravings! The portions are also very, very generous compared to other places I've been to.

I had the Ahi Tuna Poke bowl with brown rice, and it was absolutely delicious. The staff brought us water as they made the food fresh, took them maybe 5 minutes to bring it over, and we dined. Two poke bowl meals came to around $25. I'd definitely go back for more!", "author": "Torrey J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-30", "description": "I tried this place for the first time today when I had a hankering for a guiltless quick lunch. I ordered the  raw spicy salmon bowl with white rice and sunflower seeds. It was AMAZING! The serving was very generous (It filled me and my wife couldn't finish hers). It came loaded with vegetables and salmon and was ready very quickly. For the price I don't know how you can beat this poke bowl.", "author": "Adam S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-17", "description": "Always thought Poke was a bland gimmick before this place.  Definitely the best Poke I've had in New York.  Instead of just \"fish and rice,\" Simple has big bowls with 8-10 (ish) well balanced ingredients and complex flavors that make even finishing the rice a pleasure.  The bowls are also unusually large which is great. Staff are super friendly too.\n\nStrongly recommend!", "author": "Colin M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-04", "description": "Unexpected and delicious spot on Atlantic Ave! The salmon in the bento box was cooked perfectly, which is hard to find in a nice restaurant, much less in a casual lunch spot. Not the cheapest, but delicious and healthy food I highly recommend.", "author": "John K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-11", "description": "The selection and quality of the ingredients are excellent! The tuna in the tuna bowl was so fresh and paired perfectly with the other ingredients. There are also vegetarian options and salad base options. It's a great place for people looking for a real, quality  meal on the go and also people looking to be healthy- 2 things that can be hard to find in this area. The service was so warm and friendly! They bring the food to you if you're eating in and the space is very hip. This will definitely be a go-to lunch and dinner spot for us :)", "author": "Tara R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-29", "description": "Had the best poke bowl ever here! I got the tofu bowl and I'm not even a huge fan of tofu (trying to go veg.) Anyway, I am now craving the tofu poke. It was like heaven so silky! Sooooooo good! With the sauce, and the everything!

I order the Spicy Tuna Raw Poke Bowl at LEAST once a week- it's so delicious and the staff is extremely hospitable!
