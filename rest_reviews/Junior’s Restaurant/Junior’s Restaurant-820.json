The batter was very light and stuck well to a nice thick juicy onion. We also enjoyed a slice of the red velvet cheesecake and the lemon curd coconut cake both were fresh and moist and so yummy!\n\nAs a Seinfeld fan and someone from Canada I had to also try the infamous 'Black and White' cookie and man they were good! Nothing like I've ever had.\n\nAlso their chocolate chip cookies were delicious- they had a ginger taste which worked perfectly and were so soft. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Kelly M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-28", "description": "Some of the best desert in the five boroughs with classic diner fare and a welcoming staff.

I've had a ton of different things here and have never been disappointed. I love the fried chicken and the desserts.\n\nThe service is \"good for Brooklyn\". You're not going to be coddled here, but you'll get your food without confrontation (the hallmark of Brooklyn culture in most service situations). \n\nIf you're a tourist, you'll probably note that the neighborhood is incredibly diverse and somewhat dangerous at night. If you're a native New Yorker, you'll probably get in and out of there without dallying long enough to get mugged. \n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, stop by and grab some lunch - it's excellent.", "author": "Johnny P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-15", "description": "I'm from ca and was told its a must have when in Brooklyn...

I placed an order for two cakes ($128 delivered). I drove an hour to get to the delivery location for pickup of one of the cakes for T-G dinner. No cheese cake. The other cake was sent as a gift, for my mother, who lives in another state, to serve at Thanksgiving dinner. She stayed home to receive it, but it never arrived on the scheduled delivery day -- the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. When I called Junior's, they hadn't shipped either cake yet, even though it was past delivery date. They said a batch had been ruined, and that's why the cakes didn't ship. It would have been the easiest thing in the world to send an email to those who ordered saying our orders would not be delivered on time, and ask if they should cancel the order. People ship these as gifts, so the delivery is time-sensitive, but they didn't bother to notify me about the delayed shipments.  When I called Junior's on Tuesday after the last UPS delivery of the day, they told me that they would absolutely get the cakes out for delivery on Wednesday, and there would be \"movement\" at UPS by early Wednesday morning.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nI checked UPS tracking this morning. One cake was on the move, but UPS didn't receive the other cake, the one that's supposed to go to my mother two days before Thanksgiving. So I called Junior's. The person I spoke with insisted rather testily that both cakes went out for delivery today, even though UPS was, at that point, showing that they had only one cake from my order of two cakes. The woman at Junior's insisted that the tracking number hadn't been updated and \"All CAKES WERE SHIPPED,\" Me: \"but...\" Her: \"ALL ORDERS WERE SHIPPED.\" Me: \"You're telling both cakes were shipped and will arrive today.\" Her: \"YES.\"  The woman I spoke with wouldn't actually look up my specific order. She just insisted all delayed cakes were shipped.\n\nFast forward to noon Wednesday. I was called by someone else from Junior's (the woman I spoke with late on Tuesday) who said that unfortunately only one of the two cakes was shipped, but they could deliver the missing one next Tuesday. It was a gift for Thanksgiving -- tomorrow. I had purposely ordered last week, and scheduled the order for delivery two days prior to Thanksgiving, just in case there was a screw up. My mom doesn't need to sit around and eat an entire cheesecake by herself next Tuesday.\n\nWaiting to see if they can manage to handle my refund for the undelivered cake correctly.\n\nThis was so badly handled. I will not order from Junior's again.", "author": "Paul P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-12", "description": "Talk about tradition.\n\nThis place has been around forever. \nLocated in downtown Brooklyn - full of heritage and pride, this humongous restaurant hides in a simple building there.\n\nTheir food was incredible. They have amazing burgers, and cheesecakes.\n\nI loved the feel of the place. The music they played. The servers, grown men that live for this job, their tradition, their heritage. I loved this place.\n\nIt seemed so proud and dignified of who they have been for the past decades.

The strawberry \"jam\" that was on the cake wasn't too sweet and the Strawberries weren't too sweet either.

Don't get me wrong...it was rich and tasty, but I have had (and can make) something just as good.  First...you get pickles, picked beets and some slaw right when you sit down (yay for instant snacks). The menu has a lot of variety, so everyone can find something. Great brisket, pastrami, and corned beef. Potatoe Latkes were huge, full of flavor and crispy!  We even asked how they make them...and off course they are deep fried. DELISH! \n\nThe place is large, so seating is in abundance. We sat near the windows and really enjoyed the people watching. The service was good, and quick - we were in a hurry. \n\nIf you like diners, this is a definite must try.

It's in a seedy part of town and the decor is stuck in a time machine. Stopped in for dessert and left feeling a bit disappointed. I had the strawberry shortcake cheesecake. It reminded me of something you would find at any supermarket. Nothing special to it.  Mostly whipped cream more than anything else.  Not a lot of cheesecake consistency. My friend had the fresh strawberry cheese pie.  She made the better choice.  It was covered with fresh strawberries and the pie crust was coated with nuts. Excellent. Prices weren't steep. It was about $7 a slice. \n\nThe bathrooms were filthy. A notch above Penn Station. There also was a foul fishy smell near our table which forced us to shovel down our cheesecakes and beg for the check. I should have stuck with the original cheesecake so I will give them 3 stars because of my mistake. I visited the Times Square location in the past and had a far better experience, also weighing in on my 3 star rating. I recall I had a burger and enjoyed it. I don't know what to say  Felt like I was in the Deep South.. Normal cheesecake is great, but there was something off with this original.
