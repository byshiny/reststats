If you manage your expectations you'll more than enjoy it-- this place is feisty, vibrantly decorated, the food is decent and the tequila is...tequila. Because it is so small I imagine the experience is highly dependent on how packed they are-- I've been there twice and once was packed, once was almost empty. I would come here with buddies, but definitely not on a date, there's zero privacy. As for the lasting value of the meal?

Not a bad spot for cool drink after roasting in the sun at Brooklyn Bridge Park, but that's about it.\nThe nachos were laughably recognizable: store bought chips sprinkled with shredded bag-cheese and microwaved.  Just like home, except I had to eat them with pants on.\nI like fried, breaded fish for my fish tacos.  We asked, and the waitress said the fish was breaded.  Maybe it was breaded at some point, but not in the days leading up to our arrival and subsequent ordering at said restaurant.  Maybe it fell off somewhere, leaving bare a chicken-like texture and an aquarium-like flavor.\nEnchiladas were solid, but it's hard to screw up soggy chickentubes.  They came with EXTREMELY orange rice.  If you squinted, it looked like a pile of traffic cones from an helicopter.  I imagine the DOT has such a pile.\nMargaritas were decent, except that we we barred access to the (green?) salt lodged under the rolled rim of their plastic cups.

And don't even think you will get your food at a reasonable time let me keep it real with you, if you really hungry don't even bother to come here. It took 20mins to get my soda that was only in the fridge (it was type warm when I got it too).  I'd might as well as walk to the fridge and grab it myself. Now let's talk about the food it took about 20 more minutes for my food arrive and I only ordered corn... that corn was disgusting I'd might should have gone to the kitchen to make it myself. So I order empanadas instead cause ya girl was hungry and I was like how could they mess up empanadas ITS A SPANISH RESTAURANT LIKE COME ON B. My son that salsa verde was water I deadass dipped my empanada in and it was like drowning it in water... Btw I'm smart enough to not complain about my food or service being that I work at a Mexican restaurant myself nor am I that kind of customer to do so but listen boo I could not hold my frustration in.

It is gritty, loud and a hipster-free area (HFA) of Brooklyn. No wonder so many movies are shot here.\n\nPedro's has the feel and menu of a food stand in Mexico.  No, not Cancun.  And no I said stand not a truck.  SoCali doesn't count.   Here you get a long list (not a menu) of items, mostly alacarte, that range from lightly finessed guacamole, fried plantains, hardshell tacos, chimichangas.  It's all there.  * I ordered Pedro's Tostones which were awesome, my friend ordered a very respectable cheese quesadilla.*  Hot sauce is made there served in a cheap plastic bottle. While it soars in true, honest ingredients, deep fried cheapness it lacks in many respects.  \n\nI gave this 3 stars, but it could be higher depending upon your situation:\n* You are not on a date.  Unless you want to say you are very cheap\n* You are ok with sitting outside.  Or you don't want to have a conversation with anyone.  \n* Actually don't come here unless you can sit outside, so avoid in the winter.\n* If fried foods are not your friends, you will find mostly enemies on the menu\n* You don't have to be somewhere later.  Anywhere.  No matter how late.\n\nThe slow service while sitting in a low ceiling eatery with heat lamps casting their glare on you, while impacted by rock-star level noise isn't  my thing.

Maybe it's an onion? Or lettuce?\"\n\"That was supposed to be pico de gallo, right?\"\n\nLook, I don't remember the last time I just didn't eat my dinner. OK, maybe there was one time when I was seven and my barely related aunt threw a gob of peas and cheese salad on my plate. But sometimes, traumatic childhood memories resurface in the form of a quesedilla from Pedro's. It was the same foul joke that they would have served in the elementary school cafeteria--that slightly defrosted, inedible mass that's taking up space on your styrofoam plate. I had three bites and threw in the towel. A paper towel, to be precise. Which lightly blew into my dixie cup, knocking over the half shot of water it contained. But whatever, right? It's part of the kitschy charm...\n\nThe servers are useless. I couldn't find her so asked some other woman about the mysterious and off-putting contents of my quesedilla.

It's kind of pricey, but it's also DUMBO, so. The drinks were yummy, though not super strong for the price. Our server was a such a gem, I really enjoyed her.

They'll set you up at a table if you want food. \n\nThe margaritas were pretty good, and they definitely weren't watered down. plenty of cheap beer options as well.

Now when most people hear Spanish, they think either Espana or Mexico but Pedro's is a fusion of Latin cuisine from other Spanish countries like the Dominican Republic too. \n\nThe bar was pretty packed when we entered and a few couples were having dinner too. I ordered the chimichangas con pollo con arroz y frijoles negros (chicken chimichangas with rice and black beans). Danny got the Mofongo con pollo (mashed green plantains with chicken), a traditional dish he grew up eating as a kid. The chimichangas were pretty delectable. Covered with a semi spicy spanish style bbq sauce and sour creme, a little ensalada and the rice and beans on the side made for a delicious mix of flavors. The mofongo, which was my first ever, was covered in a tomato based sauce and was quite tasty but the chicken wasn't meaty enough four our liking. \n\nThe service was friendly. Our waitress was just attentive enough and very sweet. The space is super casual and a tad muggy though they have AC's and fans blasting on high to cool off the space. Overall, I feel like I'll have a craving for one of their chimichangas soon.

SO NASTY!\n\nI went here tonight with my husband because they had outdoor seating.  \n\nWe sat down and within 5 seconds, the waitress asked us what we wanted to order.  Uh, can you give us a minute to sit down and look at the damn menu?! We asked for a minute and then she came back like 30 seconds later to ask us what we wanted! So annoying! \n\nWe ordered chips and salsa to start and the chips were so stale and the salsa was straight out of a jar.  Who gets salsa and chips wrong, really?!\n\nI ordered the chicken enchiladas and my husband ordered the chicken fajitas.  Both of our dishes were so DISGUSTINGLY nasty we couldnt eat it after a few small bites.  My husband asked for a small side of sour cream and the waitress brought out a side of rotten brown lettuce, rotten pickled red onions, sour cream, and some parmesan cheese.  She charged us $3 for those tiny sides that were BROWN and rotten!  I was so pissed off but just wanted to get out of there quick so we paid and left!!!  Nothing was fresh!  Who gets basic Mexican food wrong like this?! Really?! I was so pissed off that we had to pay money for this garbage!\n\nThe waitress didnt even bring us water before we got our nasty meals.  And the thing that also killed me was the cheap ass plastic utensils that were given to us that was not even able to cut our damn food to eat!

This was just HORRIBLE!!! I'm so pissed off with this place.... Grr, so pissed!!!\n\nOkay so this is my story. Last night, a couple friends/ coworkers went out for a drink so we decided to try this place. As we got in we had to seat ourselves at a table.  Finally the waitress (who seems to be the only waitress working there) comes over and gives us the menu. I felt rushed because she immediately asked us what we wanted. How am I supposed to know what I want to order if I haven't even looked at the menu yet, genius?! We order nachos, and asked for some cheese at the side, she brings out another order of nachos with salsa instead. Then I order the Huevos Rancheros which was gross as hell.  I felt like they just took the black beans out of a can, heated it up and put it on the plate. It was Ewww!! I forced myself to eat it because I don't like wasting food. \n\nSo we're leaving and then we go to pay. I can't wait for the waitress who doesn't seem to be paying attention to us so I go to the bar to pay and I tell the guy put $15 on this card and the rest on the other. I specifically said fifteen mouthing it out because I had a feeling this was going to happen. When he ran my card he charged $50 instead!!! I have yet to see my $50 credited back to my card. I dunno why, but that made me really really upset. I think he was hoping I was drunk and wouldn't notice.\n\nConclusion: Stay away from this place. Keep your money or spend it elsewhere. Service is terrible. Food is terrible. And they tried to pull a fast one on me. \n\nTwo words...
