The chorizo had a great kick to it. The black bean and sweet potato was smooth and creamy.\n\nThere is one problem. The tacos are tiny. Wee little things. You will probably need to eat six of them.

The staff so friendly accommodating. Best I've ever had cant think of a single complaint except I ran out of room in my stomach.

It was after 11pm so I was impressed that they were still taking people for dinner. At this restaurant they give you paper menu's to fill out, then your server comes and grabs the menu from you. I ordered a pina colada for myself , and then two chicken tacos and a chicken quesadilla for my boyfriend and I to split. The quesadilla was amazing and you could tell that cheese was real cheese and not that artificial stuff, we ordered a second one. The tacos for me were just okay. My pina colada was really good though. It wasn't your average frozen drink. It tasted like an actual mixologist used natural flavors and real coconut water to make the pina colada flavor so I order a second one as well. We wanted to try another taco to see if it would make a difference , so we order a fried fish taco but that taco was still underwhelming. If I do ever come back to this spot, it would be for the quesadilla and the pina colada. However, this restaurant is a taco spot so their tacos SHOULD really be outstanding.", "author": "Rasheeda M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-08", "description": "Wish this was better. \n-Service was pretty much non existent. \n-Waited 20 mins for a menu (even after asking)\n-Food took 50 mins from time of order \n-Food was luke warm when it finally arrived\nIt looked fun \u0026 cool, but the actual experience was very off putting.", "author": "Gianna L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-20", "description": "The Tacombi empire has expanded to Brooklyn, setting up across the street from BAM. This new location is on the smaller side, and I could see it being busy during peak hours, but I grabbed some mid-day tacos with friends during the week and it was pretty empty. The decor is a little more bare bones than other Tacombi locations, but there is also a cute patio that offers some outside seating. I went with the crispy fish, al pastor, and carnitas tacos. The crispy fish is usually my favorite taco to get at Tacombi, but it tasted a bit off this time around. The al pastor and carnitas were spot on. We didn't get drinks because we thought the prices were a bit higher than needed, and there's no happy hour, which is certainly a bummer. Regardless, Tacombi is a welcome addition to the Fort Greene area and another great option for tacos in the neighborhood.", "author": "Chey H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-29", "description": "Great service.

(I'm looking at you El Toro, Peque\u00f1o and primos.) Enter Tacombi. \n\nThe spot they chose is on a dope corner for traffic and accessibility, opposite BAM Opera House near all the trains. The space is tiled white walls with colourful pops of graphics and Spanish. The ceilings look like pressed tin, evocative of white doilies from Tita's sala. \n\nHow did the previous tenants make rent selling caucasity on a plate with only crickets for customers? A mystery. Tacombi began their courtship of the neighbourhood with a tenants-only soft open for the folks living above them. How charming. Next day, place was lit. Although the wait for a table was endless, the service was expedient and friendly. \n\nWe had a Rubio, an Horchata, and a sugary Lupita Pi\u00f1a for refreshments. The watermelon pur\u00e9e in the Rubio was fleshy and refrescante against the tequila and lime- definite standout and summer staple.\n\nFare is tapas style. I am here for their hormone free chicken presented as Pollo Yucateco. The rice and beans was perfect texture. The seared fish taco- cod--very very good though seared is a lie, it was fried sorcery. The pork in the Gringa quesadilla and the al pastor taco is neither for gringos nor the fainthearted and should be served with a warning. The Yellowfin Tuna Tostada was buttery textured, fresh, note-perfect. Guac is very simple two or three ingredient dip done well, with chunks of just ripe avocadoes. Friends said the shrimp taco was excellence and I love that they offer fresh squeezed juices.\n\nMy only complaint is portion size but hey, tapas. And that's the smartest menu format for this spot and space with theatre and culture steps away.

The decor is kitschy cool and relaxed.  The drinks are expensive but what you'd expect of a trendy place.  The service was terrific and quick. The location is also great right at the nexus of Boerum, Ft Greene and Park Slope.\n\n- The food is just okay, and small for the price.  While I haven't found any better tacos on the area yet the price makes these hard to swallow. In case you go though, I thought the chorizo y papas was the best that I had.  (disclaimer: I lived in SF for the past few years and was spoiled by good Mexican food out there so take it all with a grain of salt.)\n\nTLDR; Hang out and drink here, skip the tacos.\n\nEdit: One last thing.

Wanted to try this place for a while since it used to be my old neighborhood. The tacos really didn't impressed me. The tacos are more on the just fancy tacos than a real one. Flavor wasn't bad but if you have tried a real taco, you'll know what I'm talking about. Also the tacos come with only one thing tortilla, the inside was really liquid so was hard to eat it with your hands. Have to use a fork for it. I will recommend this place for the drinks and the corn esquites.

For sure a little expensive compared to other Mexican places in the area but honestly SO GOOD.  Plus my server Robbie was so knowledgeable!

The patio is barebones--folding chairs, plastic plates. No greenery, no decor, just a dark navy awning, fully fenced in--feels more like a prison cafeteria.\n\nDid I mention the casual decor? Well the prices don't match that. $6.95 for ONE street taco. $14 for ONE margarita. You could eat here 4 times for $50 a pop, OR you could book roundtrip flights down to Mexico City for real street tacos at the SAME PRICE.\n\nI was excited to try this place and was sorely disappointed. Our server was very kind and attentive, that was the only highlight. We found shell of the avocado in our guacamole. \n\nYou can find SO much excellent Mexican food in Brooklyn for a fraction of the price. Tacombi is just trendy--that's it.
