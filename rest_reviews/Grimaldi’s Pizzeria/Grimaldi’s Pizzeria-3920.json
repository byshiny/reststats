It seems wintry Monday nights are the time to go, as there was zero line-up (despite being relatively jammed indoors). We went pepperoni, mushroom and extra sauce, and the lattermost is highly recommended, as they seem to prefer a dryer pie than we do. I can't recommend Grimaldi's highly enough. Ensure you order a beer as chaser. Moretti haters like me will be cheered to see crisp Peroni available.", "author": "Jeff M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-03", "description": "We all have our favorites and while this is great pizza- I'll always put Lombardi's first!

Worth a million stars for that and for the kick-ass setting underneath the Brooklyn Bridge and by the Brooklyn Heights hood.

But not too long ago they moved next door and the original grimaldis owners moved into the old spot. The new place is awful. Line literally 60 people deep sometimes, but Julianna's next door is 100 times better and they actually treat you well.  Go there. Don't wait on the Grimaldis line.

The only downside is the loooooong wait, but that's usually what you get with a place like this. The service was great, and the pizza was even better.

We ordered a small pepperoni and it came out nice and steamy from it's famous brick oven. Overall it was well worth my 15 minute wait outside in the freezing cold.\n\nYou will also appreciate the homestyle atmosphere inside. I can't say anymore for this place except that its good.

This lived up to the hype (despite my high expectations).  And amazingly, it was worth the 40-minute wait in the hot \u0026 humid weather on a late August summer evening amidst a line of hungry, hot, and sweaty tourists.  I'd do it again... and again... since this was probably the best pizza ever (still debating with a few other famous pizzerias but I think Grimaldi's will win me over).    \n\nThe place is old school Italian pizzeria vibe... energetic, red checkered table cloths on tables squeezed together tightly, pictures and the music of Frank Sinatra in the background, and service that is gruff but fun.  As you can tell from all the Yelp reviews here, it is a major tourist destination... as well it should be b/c this is what NY pizza is all about!  Do as the tourists do and make it a trip... ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory right down the block and check out the beautiful Manhattan skyline with the amazingly gorgeous Brooklyn Bridge (photo worthy... wish I had brought a real camera).  BUT do NOT do as the tourists do and go there at peak lunch or dinner hours, unless you don't mind waiting in line for over an hour.  Go during an off time and when you're feeling guilty about how much pizza you stuffed in your tummy, get over it by taking a nice stroll over the bridge to Manhattan.... perfect way to cap the meal / excursion.\n\nThe pizza is perfection... every component - the crust, tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, the perfectly crispy and spicy pepperoni - was done just right.  I've never had such great pizza dough... chewy but still light / crispy taste, esp those first several bites after the pie has come fresh out of the brick oven.  My friend and I split a large (splurge for the large since it's only $2 more than the medium) and got half the pie Margherita style and the other half with pepperoni, sausage, and basil.  Both sides were delicious but I think the meat side won out... mainly due to the pepperoni, which I normally don't like that much but these were damn good.  Because the dough, cheese, and sauce is so good... you really can't go wrong with your choice of toppings here... probably just stick to a few though since too many toppings will mask the great essence of the pizza.\n\nAs we polished off the entire pie, I wished Grimaldi's was closer to me or they delivered.  But you know what... the experience would not be the same if it came that easily.  Also, I'd probably quickly gain 10 lbs if it were any closer.  Wherever I have my next slice will be tough... I just can't imagine anything better than this.  Let's just make sure I'm not subjected to Domino's or Papa John or any crap like that.", "author": "camilla c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-04", "description": "We were excited to try out their pizza since we've heard so many good things about it.

Really delicious, and the ambiance of the place is certainly a Brooklyn experience. However, waiting in line for 1-2 hours? I don't think so. It's not worth the wait.

We got there with a line outside and it went pretty quick which was good.  Once we where seated we ordered two pies and sodas.  We got our pizza and that was the last time we saw our waiter.  Needless to say the pizza was mediocre at best.  We ordered tartufo for dessert which was very good.  Being that we went there for the pizza though which wasn't good and the service was terrible I will not be going back nor recommending this place to anyone.  If you want good pizza in Brooklyn go over to L\u0026B spumoni garden.  It's not a thin crust pizza more of a deep dish square slice but delicious.

Hands down the best pizza place in NY.   I've heard all the hype- two boots, lombardi's, EFF that.  Grimaldi's by far has the freshest best tasting dough out there.  They make the crust fresh and they don't use the shredded mozzarella cheese like most places.  Instead they use real blocks of cheese and place those liberally throughout the pizza.  Surprisingly enough they don't even use that much tomato sauce, while most people think that's how pizza should be made, i think that's part of the Grimaldi secret- less sauce, more real mozzarella.  who knows, they probably lace their dough with crack.  Either way, the shit's bananas.", "author": "Michael H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-09", "description": "Great pizza but horrible atmosphere.
