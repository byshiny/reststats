This place gets packed quick and there's always a long wait for a table.  Am used to portion size meals but this place is really cheap about giving you a decent portion size meal, especially for the prices they are asking for. On top of that the food was just ok was not wowed by any of the meals I had. I had the lobster pasta, a type of cod fish that they had( that was pretty good but I have had better) and some corn.

Charming atmosphere, reasonably priced and awesome service. Little hidden gem in a great neighborhood. Really cool place to impress out of towners!\n\nThe toast with jam and butter was perfect and the lobster omelet was also great. Everyone seemed happy with their orders... Good food and a bottle of wine make any Saturday afternoon the best!\n\nAfter eating so well and if the weather so permits, don't miss the stroll around the Brooklyn Bridge Park!", "author": "Marcos E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-30", "description": "Came here for brunch, the ambiance and d\u00e9cor is very quaint and loved the backyard dining (with the exception of my seat which was directly in the path of hot air spewing from the back of an AC unit).  Had the chorizo stuffed sourdough pancakes with pineapple salsa and the Reuben Sanchez sandwich with braised corned beef, sharp cheddar, tomatillo-jalapeno jam. VHH had been on my wish list forever even though I am a big borough snob and rarely leave Manhattan... but to be honest, think maybe just was overhyped as I thought it was good but not amazing or worth the trek out there.  Our server kept forgetting what we had ordered or whethger he had taken our order so that didn't help... but I know service can be a crapshoot.  I would try again for dinner, but only if I happen to be in area...

We wanted to get a drink in the area before but there is literally nothing in that area besides the restaurant. It worked out though because we ended up getting there early and they had a table outside in their courtyard for us to sit.\n\nWe ordered the house bacon which was very yummy. Beware that if you don't love fatty bacon then this probably isn't the dish for you. \n\nFor dinner he had the pork chop and I had the pappardelle and then we also had the cornbread with jalapeno butter. The best dish was by far the corn bread it was UNREAL!!! If you go you HAVE TO GET IT!\n\nOverall we had a blast- great service, cute outdoor area and the food was very good.

At one point during our meal, your waiter and bartender engaged in what apparently was a private joke between themselves about my wife and me, with the bartender leering from the edge of the bar while the waiter literally laughed in our faces. \n\nMy wife and I were shocked, embarrassed and incredibly taken aback at such arrogant behavior.  Unfortunately, this did not come as a complete surprise, as we'd experienced similar disrespect and actual contempt in a prior visit.\n\nI probably should have spoken immediately with the manager, but honestly, I think that may have gone nowhere but further frustration, particularly given the track record we've had with your restaurant.\n\nI'm writing this email a few days after the incident, in part to ensure that I'm not over-reacting and have had a chance to cool-off, but I'm still as angry as Sunday night.\n\nAs a member of the Vinegar Hill Neighborhood Association (VHNA), I've heard and read complaints about how the staff and customers of your restaurant treat your neighbors.  Frankly, I was surprised by how much resistance you faced during the expansion of the Hillside Cafe.  But after my recent experience, I have complete sympathy with those neighbors who are offended by the behavior of your staff.\n\nI can assure you that I will never again visit your restaurant as a customer, and I'll do my utmost to ensure that my friends, neighbors and colleagues understand how your staff treats customers and neighbors.  And as a member of the VHNA, I will be sure to be a vocal and critical voice of any future plans your restaurant has that might affect our neighborhood.", "author": "A C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-12", "description": "So disappointed. Came here with high expectations and left with an empty tummy (small portions) and a puckered mouth (far too salty). \nWalked into a relatively empty restaurant around 6.30 on Friday night to be sat downstairs without a soul. When I asked if all the tables upstairs were reserved, the host replied with \"kind of.\" I've no idea what that means, but when we left all those tables were still empty. And I think being downstairs was partly why we were somewhat ignored. \nI came here with a vegetarian guest, who had read on their website that despite the limited vegetarian choices, the chef would adapt dishes to suit. When we asked the server this, she replied with a grimace and said she'd strongly discourage that on a Friday night as he wouldn't be happy with said adaptation. Why you would go out of your way to add this to your website if this isn't the case I don't know. \nSo we order off the menu, 2 entrees and 1 side. We've already told our server that we have a show to be at and so are tight on time. 45 mins later we're still waiting for our food. When we ask, and state again that we have a show, she goes away and comes back 5 mins later to tell us it's being plated. 5 mins after that we finally get our food and the check. At this point we should already leaving for the show so we have have to rush, meaning I don't get to finish what's already a small portion. We get an apology and a drink knocked off the bill, but for $65 I was hoping to leave at least full - and not gasping for water from the over-salty chicken. \nAnd like I say, walking past those still empty tables on the way out was somewhat frustrating. This place is not in a convenient location, so you do have to go out of your way to eat here. And it's pricey. I wouldn't waste your time. \nAdditional point to make, it has a B grade, if you follow that kind of stuff.", "author": "Jackie D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-10", "description": "The watermelon crab salad was to die for and everything was so rich and uniquely flavorful.

Tucked into a cute little residential street, you'd never know it was even there.  Went with a group of 4, and made reservations (they only take a few reservations every day, and leave most of the space for walk-ins).  The small place was packed (even at 9pm on a Sunday night), but we didn't have to wait long to be seated, and while we were waiting we just enjoyed the lovely little back patio.  The place felt very homey and welcoming- fantastic decor-, and given many of the reviews, I was skeptical that the service would be good, but our waiter was attentive, friendly, and on top of things.\n\nWhile all the food was incredibly good, some highlights from the menu on the night we were there include:\n-Braised squid\n-Cast iron chicken\n-Country chop\n-Mezze meniche\n-Salted caramel custard\n\nWe ordered several other items, and shared amongst the four of us, and, after all that, plus 2 bottles of wine, our bill was $200- I was expecting it to be much higher- definitely worth every penny.

It was really, super, amazingingly, awesomely, wonderfully juicy and delicious.

Everything was going fine until my friend asked if she could order a side of grits (they came with the pork dish we had ordered and since she's a vegetarian, she was looking for other options). The waiter basically blew us off, explaining that they only serve girts with the pork and they don't order enough grits to serve as sides. It was 11:30 pm at this point -- and we were just about the last people who'd been sat -- and it just seemed so, well, petty not to say, \"Sure, we'll serve you a side of grits.\" It's not like we were asking for them for free; we wanted to pay for them. And the chances of them having a run on pork \u0026 grits at that late hour were slim to none.\n\nThen the manager (Mario) came over and was such a giant d***.
