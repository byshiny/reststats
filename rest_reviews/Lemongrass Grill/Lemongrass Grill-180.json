Really cheap lunch special with a bunch of appetizers included and a drink. The food is pretty good - I usually get a curry with chicken or beef. The string bean basil is weird - delicious if you get it at night, but if you order at lunch I've always had it undercooked. Maybe they're too busy?\n\nAnyway, definitely stop in here for lunch.", "author": "Bill L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-21", "description": "I stumbled across this place a few months ago and it has been my favorite choice for a sunday thai brunch ever since. \n\nGreat service with very affordable and good tasting food, with a good atmosphere. I mostly enjoy the lunch special. My wife and i end up alternating chicken pad thai and chicken green curry together. The free appetizers and iced tea is an awesome addition.  \n\nDefinitely a great place for first time visitors and ongoing yelpers looking for some affordable great tasting thai food.", "author": "Sam S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-09", "description": "Came here with a bunch of friends for lunch and the food is amazingly delicious , fulling and very affordable , the customer service is pretty good and the ambiance is cute and extremely serene..

The dumpling came drenched in oil which I wasn't expecting and the taste was okay. However, the fried dumpling and the sauce that it came with was amazing! That sauce though!

I walked in on a holiday for dinner after work and I was totally impressed. While it was a mad house, and there were only two or three servers on the floor, the service was prompt and came with a smile. It was noisy as hell (complete with yelling kids and rowdy customers) in the restaurant and I was annoyed for the staff. They kept their cool, though. Amazing. \n\nThe food was good. I had the basil fried rice and was served a generous amount which was delicious. So delicious I had to take my leftovers home.\n\nI will surely be back for take-out or delivery in the near future.", "author": "Adriane C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-13", "description": "After an intense cross training kick boxing class that KICKED MY ASS!!!!!!!!!! I was so HUUUUUUUUUUUUNGRY!!!!!!!!!! and needed some fuel.......... and so stopped at Lemongrass Grill... \n\nThe decor is nice and the staff is so attentive - which is real nice. With no hesitation I ordered the Steamed Thai dumplings as an appetizer (very good - really like the dipping sauce) and for my entree I ordered \"Ocean's Four Shrimp, squid, scallop \u0026 mussel w.coconut milk, basil leaves \u0026 pepper in Panang curry sauce. $13.00\"\n\nOMG that dish was so DELICIOUS............. yes I enjoyed every minute of it - then I ordered some veggies to replace the rice - since I am on a serious serious 30 day weight loss challenge - I ordered the \"Broccoli w.

I used to eat in the Union Square restaurant several times a month for dinner. My favorites on the menu being the fresh summer rolls, the vegetarian spring rolls and most of all, the Tao Hu Hor, aka \"tofu delight,\" which is yuba, aka bean curd skin, wrapped around shittake mushrooms and tofu and smothered in a light black bean sauce with bamboo shoots over a bed of steamed spinach. (As I wrote that description out, my mouth watered a bit). This dish, as far as I know, isn't that common in Thai restaurants, as I always look for it and rarely find it. When I moved out of New York, I couldn't find it anywhere.\n\nSo! When in town, and when in the mood for Thai food, I figure I can count on Lemongrass Grill for this favorite entree of mine.\n\nApparently not at this location, though their online menu that I found (not linked above, probably because it's out of date) indicated that they do have it. I think I almost cried when the kind lady who answered the phone informed me that they no longer carry it (specifically, they don't have bean curd skin, but can make it for you without. As bean curd skin is what makes it, I declined and then wasted about 3 minutes of the lady's time trying to find something else I wanted to eat. I hate being \"that person.\" She was extremely nice and made some suggestions, but when your heart is set on something, you know how it goes...)\n\nAnd perhaps I was punished a bit for that bout of indecision because our order took about 50 minutes to arrive at our door. My amended order: veg spring rolls and Panang curry (red curry). They forgot to include the hot sauce that I asked for and depend on to make food spicy enough. Instead they included plastic utensils when I specifically had said \"no utensils\" (it's good that they ask, though, don't get me wrong). The veg spring rolls were OK, though more full of shredded cabbage than described on the (out of date) menu which says they have sprouts, tofu and carrots in them as well. The Panang curry was very tasty, though not at all spicy enough, and as requested, they added in some broccoli and bamboo shoots with the tofu/basil and left out the bell pepper. \n\nAll in all, OK, but I probably won't be ordering from here again since they removed my favorite dish from the menu, not that I expect them to put it back if it wasn't that popular. I know I can count on quicker delivery from other Thai places in the area, too.", "author": "Joi B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-23", "description": "Been here more than once and I will always come back.

In regards to their service, my food has always been either on time or early, and they always put something extra in with my order, like edamame or even dessert!\n\nI've enjoyed pretty much everything I've had here, but my favorites are the country style dumplings and cashew-king (insert protein of choice here). The volcano chicken is good as well. The only thing that I've had which I haven't been thrilled with was the duck salad. The duck seemed a bit greasy to me, which ended up making the lettuce and vegetables of the salad greasy too.", "author": "Emily J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-20", "description": "Staff was extremely rude upon entering and acted like they didn't want our business...so our group left and went to cafe chili and a polar opposite experience...will not be going to lemongrass", "author": "NJ J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-11-23", "description": "This is my second time here.

I've lived in the hood for years and tried them all and Lemongrass is by far the most authentic you can get south of queens. Best Thai beef salad anywhere!! The Tom yum and Tom Kha soups are great. The green curry and the eggplant basil are very good. And papaya salad is nice and light. The best part is when you ask for something extra spicy they actually make it extra spicy!
