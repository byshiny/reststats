I love having brunch there on the weekends then taking a stroll [literally] right down the block to the promenade for some awesome views of the city. \n\nI love the eggs benedict and orange ricotta pancakes when I go there for brunch.

Everything about it hits me with waves of nostalgia, down to the hideous naugahyde wall hanging. \n\nTo be honest, I felt more of a connection with the Manhattan location, which has been gone for quite some time, but that doesn't make this spot any less pleasant. While it's not of the caliber of Greenpoint Polish grub, their soups and pierogies are more than decent. Dill-heavy chicken soup, scrumptious white borscht, greasy entrees, what more could you ask for? It is the epitome of inexpensive comfort food, located in a part of Brooklyn Heights where you will generally pay a lot more for a satisfying meal than you are willing. An added bonus is that you can walk off that heavy, greasy grub with a stroll along the Promenade! \n\nDo it!", "author": "Briana M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-02", "description": "BEST BLINTZES EVER!!!!! I used to have a love affair with Veselka's blintzes but then my friend moved to Brooklyn Heights and I tried this place out. OH MY GOD! They are like deep fried amazingness! I am talking about the cheese ones no need for extra fancy stuff!

I hate Teresa's! It's the best place in Brooklyn Heights! It's the restaurant equivalent of the DMV! \nSo I've been having this schizoid love/hate relationship with Teresa's for the past 13 years. You can have a fantastic meal here, and you can have a horror show too. From my many visits I've reached this basic conclusion: busy=good. When they are crowded, they are on their game. When they're not, the staff seems to get so relaxed that they just don't care about the food, the customers, service or anything else. As for the food, go for the Polish stuff. Blintzes are delicate and handled with great care. If you're lucky, they'll have fresh blueberry ones - sublime. Pancakes are also good. Polish classics like perogies, kielbasa and traditional soups shine. You can get the rarely seen white borscht, thick and sour, on weekends. The cucumber salad, dressed in dill and sour cream, is heavenly. They have a reasonably priced full bar, but I'd go with beer or straight booze. Wine selections and mixed drinks aren't their fort\u00e9. \nThe rest of the menu is normal diner food; the perfunctory stuff you can find anywhere.  It may be prepared reasonably well, or it may be garbage, depending on who's in the kitchen and what mood they're in. Stick with the Polish stuff. \nNow service, that's a weak point here. At best, it's fast and efficient, though never friendly. At worst, it's outright hostile: you'll have to get up and hunt down a reluctant waiter for water, cutlery, whatever, and they won't be happy about being found. But you can't blame the staff, they're just taking their cues from the owners, who can be astonishingly rude, keeping customers waiting a loooong time to pay while they close out their credit card receipts in the middle of the day. There's a reason every other restaurant does that after they close, it's disruptive. And no, they won't apologize for keeping you waiting. If you go at the right time and order the right thing and the cook is in the right mood you'll have a great meal. If not, it's still better than the other sad options on Montague.", "author": "Zando E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-25", "description": "Stumbled upon this place and so happy I did!

We are big soup people and love their chicken noodle soup.  I am a huge fan of their white borscht soup which is only served on the weekends.  8 bucks a quart can seem little pricey but I think it is worth it.  We try to avoid this place on the weekends because it is families and I just cant enjoy a meal when a baby is crying or a 5 year old has a temper tantrum.

We ordered massive amounts of food, considering we are two tiny Korean girls. Our feast that day included various types of perogies (meat, mushroom and leek, potato), deep fried potato pancakes with applesauce, orange ricotta cheese pancakes and a side of scrambled eggs all to be washed down with some mediocre coffee and a large glass of pulpy grapefruit juice.\n\nThe perogies were pretty good, although the starchy parts could have been a bit less rubbery. The meat perogies were a bit dry and the texture was tough, but the flavor was okay. The potato perogies were very good, but my favorite were the mushroom and leek perogies--these were less dense and more flavorful. The stewed onions and vinegar complimented these so well and we devoured them.\n\nThe potato pancakes were phenomenal--probably the best I've ever had. They came out piping hot and crispy, thin and juicy (mm, all that oily goodness!) and were reminiscent of hashbrowns except completely devoid of that dense and soggy quality. We topped these savory suckers with some applesauce and they were divine. Finished all three.\n\nThe orange ricotta pancakes were a bit disappointing however. They didn't incorporate the ricotta cheese into the pancake very well. I also would have appreciated more ricotta, period. There were chunks here and there but the flavor just didn't stand out. Also lacking was a strong (or even slight!) citrusy flavor throughout the pancakes. In fact, I could barely taste any hint of \"orange\".  I was surprised to notice however that the pancakes themselves were fluffy, light and moist. So the texture was fine--they just didn't deliver on taste. This portion was huge. There were either three or four large pancakes--we got about halfway through these.\n\nThe scrambled eggs were standard but good--they were fluffy and not overcooked. The coffee was mediocre but I thought the pulpy grapefruit juice was great.\n\nThis is a no-brainer place to hit up if you want to eat non-American cuisine. Order lots of various dishes and make sure to eat like a truck driver. Our session here definitely cured my hangover, just leave your health conscience at home and go all out.

The sandwiches already come with a decent side salad (which you would not know because it doesn't say on the menu) and they too were lukewarm. \n\nThe service throughout my entire meal was below average, and there was excessive standing around at the bar, but I am admittedly very critical after having six years of restaurant experience. \n\nAlso, Teresa's clientele is overwhelmingly comprised of the over-sixty crowd.

My husband took ne and my daughter to Teresa's for dinner.  I ordered one of the specials, rack of lamb. My husband ordered the veal goulash.

Fifteen mins. later, she came back.  The food was just as cold.  Prior to this, we had a rude busboy who brought us water in crusty and greasy glasses.
