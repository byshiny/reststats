I live in the area so instead of having them deliver, I always walk a few blocks to get my order. I usually do this:\n\n1. Go to dominos.com and order from offline. \n2. Watch the tracker and when it's done, go downstairs and get my order. \n\nThis method has been convenient because it allows me to see when my order is ready.\n\nCustomer service is decent and usually ready in 15/20 mins from the point of ordering which is cool. \n\nI dunno maybe I'm jinxing myself but I've never had a bad experience with this place.", "author": "Emmy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-04-13", "description": "I know Dominos is convenient trash pizza, but a $5 delivery charge that isn't even considered too is wild.

The delivery driver refused to come up to delivery the order to my door and wanted me to come to his car to pick it up.  Not only was he rude and demanded I come to his car he said he wouldn't deliver it to me but insisted that it was car side pick up only.  I can't tell you how unsafe that is for a female to have to go to a strange mans car to get a pizza that you pay a delivery fee for.  I did call the store and the manager was nice and said he wouldn't have that driver deliver our order any more but I will not be ordering from there again.", "author": "Ashley C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-11-13", "description": "I'm pretty confident you've got to be fairly intoxicated or mentally challenged in some way to be ordering from Dominos while in NYC, especially in Brooklyn. In which case, are you really reading this review? Stop it. STOP. IT. The acceptable time to order Domino's is when every other possibility is closed or won't deliver and you can't leave the house for some reason. That typically means it's about 2am, you're drunk, and just need some pizza. At which point you probably won't care that Domino's just charged you $24 for a large pepperoni pizza (about the same as just about any mom and pop pizza place in the city would have charged you for a significantly better pizza) or that they somehow messed up your very simple order. Just try not to be too drunk where you don't hear your phone and/or buzzer because rather than leaving the pizza on your doorstep or refunding your card, they'll keep both the money and the pizza. But I'm sure you wouldn't do that, after all you're responsible enough to call Domino's in your state, there's way worse decisions you could have made. When all is said and done Domino's does make a decent super-late night pizza to indulge in on rare occasions.

Ordered a pizza and a salad. The salad that came had an expiration date that was 3 days past due. When I called back to get a refund they told me that I should have called back immediately after I got the expired food instead of a few hours later when I decided to eat the salad. They decided that they would refund me, but instead I was called back to be told that they were not able to do refunds on the same day of service and that I would have to call back tomorrow. When I instead requested a non expired salad to be delivered they waited an hour and then called me from the car to say it was against Dominos policy for the delivery person to leave their car!

I ordered at 9:15, the max estimated delivery time was 10:30.   I just now received the pizza at 11:30.   That is an hour over the estimation, and a 2+ hour wait overall, which is unacceptable. \n\nThe delivery guy couldn't find my apartment, so he started calling out to random strangers on the street to see if they knew anyone who ordered a pizza.    I happened to hear his voice and called him over through the window.  Turns out his phone was dead, which is unacceptable by all accounts, but asking strangers if they knew anyone who ordered a pizza?   Weird.   \n\nThe pizza is now here an hour late and  ice cold.
