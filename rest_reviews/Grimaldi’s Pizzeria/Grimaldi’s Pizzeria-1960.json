Perfect place for a date: grab some ice cream, watch the sun set over the Financial District skyline, and then finish the night off with some of NY's finest pizza.\n\nBeen here 3 times, each time with a different group of visitors and there has always been a line! The line usually moves pretty quickly and I've waited 30 min twice, but memorial weekend I waited 1hr45min!! For whatever reason people were loitering inside and taking their sweet time that night. Good thing to do while waiting in line is have one of your party pick up ice cream from the ice cream factory and bring it back.\n\nThe pizza is very comparable to Lombardi's. For those who claim Lombardi's is better than Grimaldi's or vice-versa, they're just kidding themselves. It's like a coke/pepsi argument. For toppings I  recommend fresh garlic, extra tomatoes, and extra basil.

Yep. sure is.  We went to lunch there yesterday and waited in line about an hour. It was totally worth it. The pizza was fabulous, the drinks nice and cool, the price a bargain and the service friendly and welcoming. \n\nIf it is a sunny day, a sun umbrella is a nice thing to have along with you for the wait in line :)", "author": "Alexandra S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "My first time at the famous Grimaldi's.  Maybe the new oven at their digs has affected the pizzas.  This was nothing to write home about.  And it would be nice to have something (like salad) on the menu.\n\nTried the white and traditional pizzas.  They were OK but not up to the hype.  I wish they had been crisper.  I've had better.  It was kind of disappointing given how much I have heard about people rave about Grimaldi's.  \n\nOh, and be careful.  On the hand-written scribbled check, they tacked on a tip.

It's a real meal, easy for your body to process, not the kind that gives you heartburn or makes you need to run to the bathroom in the couples hours following.\n\nI think people like it so much because its tastes fresh and almost healthy, but also because its got a classic Italian family comfort food appeal. \n\nUnfortunately the wait, service and atmosphere inside leaves something to be desired.. not the warm familial Italian greeting that would accompany this pizza perfectly. I'd frequent a mom\u0026pop shop over this place any day!\n\nThat being said.. its kind of a tourist attraction in itself.. if you have never been, and especially if you have people coming in town who are interested.. I think it can be kind of fun to make a day out of it. On a beautiful spring or fall day walk across the Brooklyn Bridge together, enjoy this pizza, and head down the street afterward for some ice cream.  Make sure its people you really like, and haven't seen in a long time or don't hanging out with for several hours.", "author": "Angela K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-09", "description": "Adam R. mentioned to me that as much as I love pizza (especially real NY pizza), I've never given any place five stars. Not even Patsy's, which I really do just adore. So I decided I'd give that honor to Grimaldi's.\n\nI think every time I've been here has been preceded by a long walk (including going over the Brooklyn Bridge), which makes me wonder if the hunger I incur from that walk makes the pizza taste better. Or maybe it's just that good.\n\nI think it's that good.\n\nYes, the lines suck. And yes, there are tourists and locals alike in that line. And yes, the line is worse when it's nice out. But the pizza when you finally get to it? It's heavenly. Huge bubbles on the cornicione with crispy crust. Not too heavy on the cheese but not skimpy either. Just delicious, really!

In Italy they use mozzarella di bufala, which is mozz from the water buffalo. It's a little richer, and the one they use for the pizza has less moisture than the one they use here, but it's still really close. It's not exactly what I would call \"New York\" style, but the crust IS on the thinner side and it is pretty good. \n\nThe service is very slow though they are always at least a little busy. The tables are also kind of small and the layout makes it hard to navigate my fat a** around the tables.

I've had a whole lot of pizza in my life, but nothing that (in my opinion) beat Pizza John's.  Until now.\n\nI have to admit that Grimaldi's coal oven-baked pizza, with its light amount of tomato sauce, sufficiently plentiful quality toppings, dollops of fresh mozzarella, moderate amount of grated cheese, fresh basil and a bit of olive oil now hold the place in my tummy and mind as best pizza I've ever had!  Super good crust that was relatively thin but not crispy, and very tasty, though when we spied some pizzas at other tables a few appeared to be somewhat burnt around the edges.  Ours was not.  We had a small pizza, half plain and half Italian sausage.\n\nThe wait, which we endured in mid-to-late afternoon before prime dinner hours, was at least 45 minutes, though we feared it would be a good bit longer given the long line that ran far down the neighboring sidewalk.  It's a big place with lots of tables, and they seem pretty efficient and getting tables cleared and seating the next customers.  Service was the only thing holding our rating back from 5 stars to 4.  Our waiter was pretty slow, and one does not want to wait to be served whilst hungry and having endured a wait!  To top it off he went and first served a party that was seated after us before he came and took our order.  It was also easy to note that numerous other customers were tiring of waiting to order or to get their check.\n\nSo, 5-star pizza (I'd give it 6 if I could!) and 4-star overall.", "author": "Pat M."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Grimaldi\u2019s Pizzeria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "1 Front St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWKNFR58TIuA7M25dqj9rQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584300"}
