But where Juniors fails is the service. We stopped for breakfast and the service, It's slow, and the wait staff is lethargic, unless they are talking to other wait staff. They are in this 'sleep walk' mode that takes away from the food. We decided to stop by the bakery and the cashier never stopped talking to her friend the whole time we checked out. We were wanting to ask questions and maybe purchase additional items but the impersonal touch left us just wanting to leave. \nThe food is excellent but we know now the service doesn't match.", "author": "Edward B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-14", "description": "Juniors cheesecake.... do i need to say anymore.

As expected, it was tasty!  \n\nThe carrot cake, devil's food and chocolate swirl cheesecakes were all recommended.

The food is good (though not great, other than the cheesecake), the service is very good and the seating is very comfortable and nobody rushes you.

Their food is timeless. They start every meal off with complimentary pickles, beets, coleslaw and bread. I love their breakfast, turkey and stuffing, Hungarian ghoulish, jerk chicken, chicken fingers and cheeseburger. But be sure to save room for the best for last.

Alnasir was our waiter I believe, and he was fantastic! Super cordial and friendly wl amazing customer service skills. Tried the fried seafood platter and it was legit one of the best I've ever had!

It is definitely one of the best.\n\nI also had the pastrami reuben sandwich. First time having one, so don't have a comparison, but it was delicious! I've had pastrami before and this was tender and tasty.\n\nSo why only 4 stars? Well, the service was a bit clinical. The diner environment is a bit shabby.

I was visiting the in-laws and, as usual, did not have the time to do anything I wanted.  I planned for days to go to Junior's but it didn't happen.  Luckily through reading Yelp reviews, I found out that the cheesecakes could be ordered online and delivered across the nation.\n\nThere were more cheesecake flavors available for delivery than I saw on their online menu for dining in.  I ended up settling on the Favorites Mini Sampler, which consisted of six of each flavor: raspberry swirl, red velvet and devil's food cake.  It cost $44.95 plus $12.00 for 2-day UPS shipping.  Note: It still took a week before it was actually shipped, so if you need it for an event, place your order well in advance.\n\nThe cheesecakes were shipped frozen, in a giant Styrofoam box with five pounds of dry ice.  By the time they arrived after a two-day travel, almost no dry ice remained and the desserts were slightly softened.  The idiot UPS guy left the box out in the sun and didn't even bother ringing the bell to notify me of a delivery.  It even described on a note taped right on the box, next to my address, what the shipment contained, but I guess reading is not part of this guy's job requirement.\n\nSo I read the paper that came with the package and it said to eat at room temperature.  I couldn't wait considering I already waited a week for them to come, so I sampled all three as they were in-between soft and slightly icy.  Terrible.  Just terrible.  It basically tasted like the four flavors sampler cheescake box that I bought several weeks prior from Trader Joe's.  I waited again until they had completely defrosted and much warmer than room temperature and they were much, much better.\n\nThe consensus is that they were average desserts and nothing special.  I did not like the cake base.  It totally needs the graham cracker bottom.  The raspberry swirl was the best (and largest of the three) and did not have a base at all.  When I was considering which sampler to purchase, I was disappointed that I had to get the raspberry one with my order considering I bake raspberry swirl cheesecakes myself.  But in hindsight, I think it was good to have Junior's for comparison and sorry, Junior- yours cannot hold a candle to mine.  My raspberry swirl cheesecakes are so much tastier, with fewer and better ingredients, no preservatives or things that I cannot pronounce and they sit on a thick graham cracker base.\n\nThe loser of the three was the devil's food cake, the one that I was looking most forward to because my sisters and bestie all wanted that one.  Methinks they're going to be sorely disappointed.  It was too rich.  The red velvet wasn't bad.\n\nMy conclusion is I will probably not order for deliver ever again, unless I go the the restaurant itself and try out in person the other flavors that I really wanted, which was the plain/original and the strawberry shortcake one.  It was just too expensive to order all that cheesecake and pay all that shipping for possibly something I was going to hate.  Maybe next time I'm in NYC...\n\nP.S.- I posted a photo of what showed up on my doorstep.", "author": "Kera K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-02", "description": "Do you like dirty restaurants with flies buzzing all over the place?
