While there were issues with getting seats quickly, and our waitress, you can't argue with great food. I ordered their ribs and chicken BBQ combo and was floored by how good the sauce and meat was. They serve breakfast all day which I always appreciate in a restaurant, and had a pretty nice selection of american style foods. The atmosphere was interesting too. The walls display a pride for the brooklyn area, particularly the Dodgers giving it a very local feel. My one complaint would be the service. Our waitress moved insufferably slow. We got our food in decent time, however once we were done with our main course she was no where to be seen for almost thirty minutes. Juniors is known for their cheesecake which we were hoping to order in enough time to catch our flight home. We were there an extra hour than we should have been waiting for her to come by for our dessert order and our check after that. It did not seem terribly busy, and we received no apology for being missing, or any overly great attitudes from her. Because of her molasses service we missed our flight. She does not take away from juniors as a whole though. She recieved a deserved 2 dollar tip, and the cheese cake was SO worth missing the flight.", "author": "Samuel N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-19", "description": "how could anyone not have something good to say about juniors.! the best place in brooklyn!", "author": "Demo K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-01", "description": "I would give 5 starts but I have experienced some pretty awful service here on more than one occasion.

My grandmother loves the food here so I take it upon myself to bring her here all the time (hey, I live in her brownstone....in Carroll Gardens....FOR FREE! Juniors is the least I can do). I can only review their burgers because I never order anything else....FOR A REASON!!!! Juniors steakburgers are definitely one of the best meals of my life! The portion sizes are HUGE and the burger will definitely last you at least two meals. I always always always get the same exact thing when I get here, the steakburger with onion rings, mushrooms, and 2 bottles of ketchup. Yup! That's right, I finish a whole bottle of ketchup in one sitting, guess that just adds to my overall amazingness as well as Juniors' amazingness as they gladly supply me with two bottles each time. Now, when you receive your burger, let me tell you, you might literally feel your arteries clog up and your heart stop as if it were really happening (bring Bayer, you never know!). The size of the meat alone can stop a heart...and those onion rings! Oy vey! They are definitely the biggest onion rings I've ever had and they're so....fluffy! Ugh yummy! One great thing about this location is they serve you DELICIOUS cornbreak, cole slow, beats, pickles, and fresh buttered rolls while you wait for your meal. UNLIKE the location in Times Square who jack up their prices $5-$7 more for the same meals in Brooklyn AND they do NOT give you anything while you wait for your food! Wtf! If people pay more, shouldn't they at least get the same amount of food as they would in BK? TImes Square and ripping off tourists....and NYers who happen to want to have a touristy day...typical!!\n\nBut, all that aside, who can forget the cheesecake! I know there was that news article that came out a few months ago that showed a mouse in the cheesecake display case...but are we to really think that our food in EVERY NYC restaurant is perfectly kept with not one hint of any type of insect, animal, or even the floor touching it?? I think not! Anyways, Juniors cleaned up the place and got it up and running again (don't worry, I didn't take my little old grandma to that place for 2 months until they got the exterminator in there!). But, did you ever wonder what heaven would taste like if it were edible? Well, here's your chance! Order a slice of Junior's cheesecake and come back and write a review about heaven, the rest of us who've eaten that cake will understand completely!", "author": "Smalls D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-24", "description": "So this is where it all began.  Now I know why there are copycats in Grand Central and Times Sq... it's pretty good stuff.  I came here for dinner on Tuesday and they have a lobster special on Tuesdays... did not get that, but was tempted.  I instead ate their fried steak-- i loved the cripsy crust, though the steak could have been a teensy bit more tender, but now I'm just nitpicking.  I'm not really a gravy person, but that was excellent gravy poured on top of the steak and on the mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately, I ate so much of the dinner I had no room for dessert.  I ended up taking a slice of their famed cheesecake back to Queens. It was quite delicious, even after a 40 minute ride to home.", "author": "Ian C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-06", "description": "I have had the cheesecake a  bunch of times and it is very good but i have had better.

I wish I could say this was due to rapt enjoyment, lingering to chat long after my meal. Alas, poor service was to blame.  The food was everything one should expect: a bit greasy, large portioned, yet wonderful. The cheesecake is great as well: a solid, hunking piece that fits the bill for such a classic confection. But when our bread basket never arrived, our beverages were forgotten, and our bill brought begrudgingly Juniors slipped in my esteem. This is the kind of restaurant that ought to be reliable.
