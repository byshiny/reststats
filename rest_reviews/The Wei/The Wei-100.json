I live and work in Manhattan and have been here twice already...\n\nYou pick a base (a couple types of rice or noodles), a protein, 2 sides and some garnishes. You can't go wrong with the noodles or green fried rice. The mala chicken is amazing (especially with their special sweet chili sauce); mapo tofu and roast pork are also great options - it's so hard to choose! My favorite sides are the eggplant and string beans. The portions are great and if you can't finish it all, it reheats really well for the next day! (I got 2 bowls last night - one to eat there and one for today) I also recommend trying their bubble tea! The original is the perfect level of sweetness.\n\nEveryone should make their Wei here ASAP!!", "author": "Erika T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-20", "description": "I'm a sucker for fast-casual food, but this is great stuff. Get the green rice. I suggest the market chicken, though the beef is pretty good also. Great fresh veggie options. If you can handle a sweet desert, GET THE SESAME BALLS! They're sooooo good. They always make them fresh, so there's about a 10 or 15 minute wait. But if you're eating there then it's no big deal because they're more of a desert item anyway.\n\nSo yeah, overall, solid for the money and very tasty. Fast and fresh.

The portions are sizable, good veggies, and I totally scarfed most of the bowl down at 8pm on Wednesday night. My main critique would be that the overall quality of the meatstuffs is a little subpar. Like, my mala chicken was a little overly breaded and hubby's bbq pork was a little gristly.

It was just OK. Nothing to really rave about, the green scallion rice, was good.. but left a weird aftertaste in my mouth (quite unpleasant). I can't put my finger on it, but it was just..well ODD.

They should invest some salt because it was like I was eating nothing.", "author": "Danny Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-07", "description": "Excited to find that a new restaurant is opening up in my neighborhood so despite the big snow, I got out of my apartment for the food odyssey. Though it is labeled as Sichuan food, it is a fusion of all kinds of Chinese food (Cantonese, Shanghainese, northern etc.) and has some trace of Americanized Chinese food so I'd say it plays well with both American and Chinese audience. From the website, the restaurant owner is from flushing and aspires to share quality Chinese food with broader audience in NYC in multiple neighborhoods. Nice try!\n\n[Food]\n\nIt is set up like Chipotle where you choose your base (rice or noodle), protein and 2 sides for $9~10. I went with my friend so I got to try multiple kinds. Usually Chinese fast food places are boring with predictable options but the Wei really amazes me with its unique \"Green Fried Rice\" - green coming from scallion puree, which I have never seen in other Chinese restaurants either here or back in China. Though a bit oily, it definitely downplays it a little bit and adds to appetite by its color. The protein options are also fresh and decent - I tried honey glazed pork (Char Siu) and black bean steak and they are both up to my standard, with big portion in a bowl. The highlight of side is definitely the eggplant - very tender, soft and not too salty and soaky. I also got baby bak choy which is properly seasoned and not too blend and it balances out the oiliness of the fried rice. I'd recommend the combination. \n \nFor drinks, I tried taro bubble tea and it is decent (though not outstanding). There is a bit too much ice and I hope they can give you the option of how much ice you want (as some other places in flushing will do like Coco).\n\nThe only suggestion I'd give is that the food generally is not too healthy and a bit too oily (though well balanced with both meat and veggie). They don't offer any brown rice option (the healthiest is just jasmine rice). They don't note the calories amount on the menu. I understand it is just a Chinese restaurant but to appeal to a broader audience, it is good to offer more options.\n\n[Service]\n\nThere was no line there when we went there because of the snow but the service is very quick and efficient. Even though they ran out of green fried rice when we ordered, they replenished it in less than 5 minutes. The space is clean and bright with big windows looking out to the streets. The decor is brooklyn-standard hippie. They do take credit cards.", "author": "Shen Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-15", "description": "Stopped in here for the first time yesterday. I had the spring rolls, ma-po tofu, veggie fried rice, and bok choy. I originally asked for the seasonal veggies instead of the bok choy, but the server, noticing that I may be a vegetarian (I am), was nice enough to inform me that the seasonal veggies are cooked in oyster sauce. Everything was fresh. The spring rolls, rice, and bok choy were good, but I was not crazy about the tofu. I think it could use a good sauce and more flavor.", "author": "Christine P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-27", "description": "Great food. The Asian restaurant with a little more class than your mama and papas Chinese food restaurant. Owned by Stan Liu this place is the Asian fast food of Brooklyn. The green rice mixed with the noodles, steak and eggplant was a meal that will set your pallets ablaze. My taste buds were on another level when eating all the combinations. The service was very friendly and efficient in getting my order prepared and ready to be consumed. The most impressive part that I think gets lost in today's fast food was the greeting received when you walk through the door. It lets you know that they are aware of your presence. Impressive, delicious, speedy service and overall fantastic ambiance. This place is a must try for Brooklynites and out of towners.
