Fish burrito is $10 (!) and was decent. Steak taco was decent. Spicy stewed chicken taco was bland. Chips were $4 but huge. At least the tacos were large, but this place is expensive for being bland.", "author": "Wook M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-15", "description": "Ate here for the first time last night.

Now they have a location that is close to where my family resides. The food is just as good and the service is impeccable.

I had 3 different tacos and the rice and beans nothing stood out or distinguished itself at all.  OMG had much better food but It looks like Fat Daddy drove them out of business too bad.

And this place has it done the best way possible! Food is on point! I had a burrito!!  And the staff is cool too, friendly people. Enviroment is also a cool, relaxed place. Nice and chill. I highly recommend this place!", "author": "Gil D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-24", "description": "This place is Way overrated. Lived in Cali and been to Mexico many times. I'm not saying I'm and expert but food is just OK. Oaxaca is worse... I don't even think they grill the meat on the premises. Best place by far is Bodega  type place Fast \u0026 Fresh Burrito on Hoyt at Atlantic. It's real mexicans making real mexican food. It has an authentic backyard area in the summer.  I do wish the other 2 places would up their game.", "author": "jay b."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-23", "description": "Excellent tacos, better than most Manhattan restaurants.

My kids and I order from here ALL the time. The restaurant is adorable, clean and organized. The delivery is always on time and fresh!
