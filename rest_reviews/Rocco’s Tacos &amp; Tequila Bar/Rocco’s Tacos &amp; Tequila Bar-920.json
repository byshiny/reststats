They really take care of you. The guac is made right in front of you and it is really delicious. Probably one of the best I've ever had. I had the taco platter and it was a very good size for lunch. And I can't forget to mention the receipts. They have a clothespin decor as their receipt thing which I thought was so innovative and cute.", "author": "Ellie O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-03", "description": "Ok, the ambience is great, the margaritas outstanding, specially the spicy ones. If you check in they give you a free shot. Great service helped, but the food was just ok, the chips were a bit burned and the prices were very high for the quality.", "author": "Juan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-13", "description": "This place has two sides. \nThe nicer one is not during the weekends or Taco Tuesday. The atmosphere is great and they have awesome music in such a cool environment. The guacamole is one the best ones I had in NYC, with warm chips. I come here pretty often and all of the dishes are really good. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Mexican food and solid prices. The drinks are also really good. \nOn the other side, if you ever wanted to come here on a weekend, just don't. They are definitely not managed well for big crowds. Also, they seem understaffed. There is always a lot wait, even if you have a reservation and the waiters take forever, which is not their fault, since they have to cover way too many tables. Brunch during the weekends is pretty good, except that the mimosas shouldn't have orange juice with pulp and the refilling part should be faster. \n\nAll in all, worth making a trip to Brooklyn, just do it during the week!", "author": "Stefan I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-21", "description": "enchilladas were fantastic.

Probably one of the livest taco bars I've been to in NYC. Seriously, what's not to love!!! Even though it was after work and I most likely was hungry (and tipsy off of those lovely margaritas), but everything I ordered was fantastic. I started off with just three tacos and found myself ordering three more...plus dessert (churros and ice cream...LOVE!!) The drinks were on point, the atmosphere was live and our server for the night, Chris, was amazing! He was very attentive and engaging; kept myself and my coworkers laughing and he never missed a beat! I fell in love with this place!!! Between the food, atmosphere and service, this will definitely be my new after-work spot!!!", "author": "Corey M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-01", "description": "This was probably one of the worst experiences of my life from beginning to end. I first called to make a reservation because we were a party of 13. They asked for a credit card to hold the reservation which I thought was understandable for such a large group. I had requested a 6:30 pm reservation but was told only 5:30 or 7 pm would be available. We opted for 5:30 since it was for a Sunday, there would be kids and my cousin \u0026 wife which were visiting from Canada (the reason for us going out) were leaving the next morning. Well upon arrival we noticed it wasn't crowded at all, actually it wasn't that busy but our table wasn't even ready. We waited about 10 -15 minutes to be seated and then about another 20-30 minutes to get our drinks. Our guacamole that we ordered table side was already being made before drinks or water were served. In our party there were 3 children total and one pregnant woman. Our waiter was beyond slow and forgetful. My nephew's orange juice took 20 minutes to be served after the rest of us had our drinks. The waiter also asked three to four times for clarification on his beef taco from the kids' menu. The waiter also forgot to enter 4 entrees. So while the rest of our table had food 4 people were sitting there with nothing. When we complained to the waiter and manager he couldn't understand why entrees were missing. The manager lied and said he had just come in and had no idea what was going on and he was trying to fix it. Lies. He had been there since we were seated. Well low and behold the waiter didn't enter them and only did when we complained. Me, being pregnant and hungry asked if he had just put in our entrees and he blatantly lied to my face and said, \"nope\". Ok so then our entrees should be flying out. Nope. The four entrees missing began coming out one by one. He apologized profusely and the manager came over and said dessert was on them. Not a resolution to the problem. At this point none of us were thinking about dessert. We just wanted to eat and leave. After all was said and done our meal took three hours and our bill was $375 with a 20% included for parties over eight. I am giving this two stars because when we did all finally get our food, it was good. The manager did take off the bill our alcoholic drinks and the four entrees that came out late but the service and food was definitely not worth it. When paying the bill, my brother and I asked the waiter for a reason as to where the breakdown was. He told us he got sidetracked and forgot to enter the entrees. So you lied earlier when you said you hadn't forgotten. ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS!!!!", "author": "Claudia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-06", "description": "Came in with my brother to grab a bite to eat because we didn't want to travel far for a meal .

No one attended us until one of us got us to grab one of the staff's attention to place our orders. After placing our order of drinks and food, the wait was about 25-30 minutes long. We got our drinks but the drinks were not great! In fact this place is overpriced for drinks that have an acquired taste and very, very salty tacos, which we got before the guacamole was served. We were almost done with the tacos by the time we got our guacamole. On another note, it was happy hour and no one informed us of which drinks were included in the happy hour menu. On the contrary, the decorations were nice but the customer service and drinks do not match the price paid.", "author": "Mercedes L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-15", "description": "OMG, the food, ambience and whole experience was excellent.
