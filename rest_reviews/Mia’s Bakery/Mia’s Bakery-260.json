In general I'm a big fan of the bakery they have delicious cake. Unfortunately they were disorganized, It rooms 4 emails for them to even respond to my initial request for a tasting. I should have taken this as a sign...\n\nWe received a very messy version of the wedding cake i envisioned. The middle layer design is completely unevenly applied. The cake layers were lopsided. We discussed that they would get someone to create a large sugar flower (sample picture attached) in a light blush. They threw on generic pink roses and completely disregarded my request. The cake did taste good, so adding a star for that.", "author": "Caitlin M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-22", "description": "I always like to give places a second try - especially if it's two blocks from my apartment.\n\nSince my first time going (and my first review), I've come to realize that their cakes are DELICIOUS and always moist (especially the cupcakes - which apparently.. is tough to do since I've tried many dry cupcakes from \"good\" bakeries).

My mom took me there and I ordered red velvet cheese cake within all the other choices but i guess was not the best pick. Top coating was a bit dry. Their check in offer for a cup of coffee with any order is a nice touch. Coffee was good.\n\nSince it's my brother birthday today, we also wanted to get a to go cake, asked for a 8 inch blueberry cheesecake but they had a 10 inch. We still got it, was about $45, left our name to pick it up within couple of hours and they were totally cool with that. When mom picked it up and left the place, she checked the receipt on it by chance on her way home and saw that it belonged some other person so she had to walk all the way back to bakery. The girl who assisted us in the morning had left so she had to bother to explain what happened and apparently, the blueberry cake was gone too. They were kind enough to give the next available size so everyone is happy now :) I will definitely go again to try other cakes and desserts they offer. Prices are so reasonable.", "author": "Ceren A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-21", "description": "I had an amazing time here . It's so relaxing and the vibe at this bakery is great; nice seating area  . They played great music ; loud enough for you to here but quiet enough to enjoy the person that you're with conversation . I had a carrot cake which was inexpensive ; taste was very rich and not to sweet . I will most certainly be coming back !!!

One night my boyfriend and I were craving a lobster tail. We only knew that we could get them in little Italy and we were not going there on a Sunday night at 8pm. I decided to look on yelp if anyone had lobster tails and Mia's Bakery showed up. I was nervous I would go all the way there (1 mile walk) and there be none, but I wanted to walk anyway so went. I got there and I was amazed that not only did they have an abundant of lobster tails, but they had soooo many things! Every dessert I could think of was here. We of course got a lobster tail, cheesecake, and crepe br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Everything was out of this world good. We have gone back many times since, it's starting to become a weekly thing, which is not helping my weight any. Right now my favorite favorite thing is the croissant donuts. Omg unreal. The maple bacon one is my favorite thing in the world.
