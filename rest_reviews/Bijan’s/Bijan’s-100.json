Bijan's offers a $17 all-inclusive brunch, which consists of coffee or tea, 1 cocktail, and an entree. Pretty good  deal.\n\nPortions are large. In my last visit, I had the Persian Wings \u0026 Salad, and I was pleasantly surprised that half of my plate was wings! The Bijan burger patty is thick, juicy and it comes with truffle fries. The fries were a little too soft for my liking, but that wasn't a problem. If you want to add cheese (blue, feta, cheddar) to your burger, it'll cost an additional $1.50.\n\nMy favorite part of eating here is sitting by the fireplace. It is so warm and cozy, especially when it's freezing outside. Try to get a seat next to the fireplace, if possible. It'll make your brunch experience that much better.\n\nLastly a note on their service: I think the service here was both professional and attentive! They did rush us a bit towards the end, even though the restaurant had lots of empty tables. Besides that, we were very happy with their service! Not sure what the one star reviews were complaining about.", "author": "Lucy M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-19", "description": "An awesome mix of authentic/traditional Persian dishes and more contemporary Persian-American. Owned and managed by a nice Iranian couple - the wife often makes the delicious stew specials.\n\nCasual spot with tables and picnic seating and a \"hip\" Brooklyn vibe.

The service has gotten progressively worse the last 3 times I've gone here with my partner. Being seated and then waiting 45 minutes for a glass of water is insane (especially when there are only 12 other customers in the restaurant). If you take an order incorrectly and serve someone the wrong dish, the least you could do is apologise. It's a shame that the attitude from the servers is so apathetic, because the food is actually really good. We won't be spending anymore money here.", "author": "Ryan F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-07", "description": "It was disappointing, The flat bread pizza was terrible, the finely minced vegetable toppings tasted as if they were thawed from being frozen, the bread did not taste fresh, it is what I would expect served in an airplane for a pizza. Some of the other dishes were just ok. When the bill arrived we felt that overpriced for the quality level of food and service.

American/Mediterranean food.  Highly Recommended! Had the Persian stew amazing flavors, with great tap beers. They have great mediterranean appetizers also. My friend had the shishkebob another deliciuos dish. I have also had the lamb burger, and the mixed beef burger more winners!  Good wine list, had a bordeaux last night after dinner and a Pilnser beer with dinner.  The fireplace was kept burnng, nice music in the backround. Sports over the bar tv's and old movies (Charlie Chaplin) in the dining room.  This is my favorite place to relax and enjoy my food ,drink and friends!

I made a reservation here for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. We had somewhere to be early afternoon and didn't want to risk being late. We walked in right at 11 and the place was empty - only the workers were there. We were told the kitchen wasn't open yet and were a little confused. Were told to come back in 10-15 so took a lap around the block. Once we got back we were good to go and had our choice of seats so we took a cute little elevated table by the window. I opted for the spinach omelette which was absolutely delicious! Only thing it could've used was a tad more cheddar. It came with a side salad and AMAZING fries. I thought I was getting home fries, but nope, even better. I also got the Bijan cocktail which was really yummy. We were the only people in there until around noon when it started to fill up (just to get a feel of when to go). Would love to come back here for dinner!

The staff is friendly and somewhat attentive (small staff = overwhelmed if restaurant is full) this particular occasion my friend had to ask twice for another drink before it was brought to the table.\nThe atmosphere is warm and inviting low lights make it an intimate dinner experience.\nI had the steak Frits and it was delicious my friend had the turkey burger and she was pleased with the over all taste. I had my drink of choice which is a jalape\u00f1o margarita which tasted more like a sweet mojito so that was why the 4 stars instead of 5 I like my jalape\u00f1o Margarita to be spicy.\nI'll be back, the meal alone has be coming back for more.", "author": "yolanda c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-29", "description": "Was here again the other night.
