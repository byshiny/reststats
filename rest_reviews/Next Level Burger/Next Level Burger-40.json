I got the most basic burger, I believe it was called the all American or something. Next time I come I'll get more fixings. My only gripe is the portion size. Everything is pretty small, save the drink size. I mean I was full regardless but I did pay $16 for my meal and it wasn't much of a looker.

Hubby and I had just finished shopping at WF 365 downstairs and we were loaded down with groceries.  This place was a hot, stuffy mob scene, with no seating to be found anywhere.  I'm barely willing to subject myself to something like this when it involves food I've really been pining for.  But a Vegan Burger?  Um, no thanks.  We had much better luck the following week when we stopped in at around 11, before doing our grocery shopping:\n\nSo-Cal Burger, aka Quinoa \u0026 Chia Seed Patty with 'Special Sauce,' Tempeh Bacon \u0026 Avocado:  In my heart, I really wanted one of the beef 'n cheese-mimicking creations, but hubby pretty much convinced me that eating faux food would be akin to pledging my allegiance to Satan, or something similarly evil.  Yeah, yeah.  How was the damn Burger already?  Honestly, I've had better. The 'Organic Whole Wheat Bun' tasted way too healthy (read: dry). The bland Quinoa \u0026 Chia Seed Patty wasn't any tastier.  The one bright spot was the Tempeh Bacon, which actually tasted vaguely meaty and had a nice crisp to it.  As for the 'Special Sauce,' yo? To me that is the magical stuff of my Big Mac loving days.  It's supposed to make everything taste better.  Not so much here.\n\nKale Salad:  Hubby ordered this and insisted that he really liked it. \"All the ingredients are incorporated throughout the Salad, rather than just piled on top, with no good stuff left as you keep eating,' he explained.  But I found its lemon dressing to be 'blah,' and there just wasn't enough of it. Am also not the biggest fan of using curly, ornamental kale for Salad and far prefer the flat-leaf dinosaur / lacinato variety for that purpose.  Yes, I'm a kale snob.  Only in Brooklyn.\n\nI'm no vegan, but am very open to eating that way. In fact, am always a bit awestruck when I find a vegan restaurant that nails it because I know they've got to try 10x as hard as a spot that caters to omnivores to create crave worthy, aka umami-fied food.  I wasn't even remotely awestruck here.\n\nBottom line:  The location of this place truly is genius.  If it were a stand alone eatery in a random part of BK, I doubt I'd ever return.  But since I'm currently a wee bit infatuated with WF 365, am sure I'll come back to give it another shot either pre or post grocery shopping.", "author": "Yael D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-16", "description": "Next Level Burger has been featured on several blogs / news articles / tastebuds with raving reviews across the board.

This is a very long review, but worth it if you have celiacs, or have a gluten intolerance.  \n\nI'm conflicted. One on hand, I've literally never had a \"good\" vegan burger until tonight. On the other, something went awry in the food prep area causing my having to rush my celiac girlfriend home once her body started to break down. We'll start with the food. \n\nYou. Must. Get. The. Brownie. Explosion. Shake. With. Coconut. Ice. Cream. Intensely cold and rich and thick, yet light because there's no dairy. Reasonably priced (for Brooklyn) at $5-6, they even give you the aluminum...shake thing to finish off the shake that couldn't fit into the glass! \n\nI was feeling extra confident and hungry (fat. I was feeling fat), so I ordered the aforementioned shake and the All-American burger and Bleu BBQ burger. \nAs per their website, the AA = Savory Meaty Patty topped with Smokey Tempeh Bacon, Cheddar or Swiss Style Cheese and Egg-Free Mayo. \n\nWho knew vegan cheese could be melty and good? The patty was savory, but like every other vegan anything I've had, was mushy with no discernible texture. The tempeh bacon (house-made) really tasted House-made, but didn't really provide a difference in texture. I can't say I love vegan mayo, but as a whole, it was a satisfying burger for someone who is neither vegetarian nor vegan.\n\nThe Bleu BBQ = House-made Umami Mushroom and Quinoa Patty topped with Smokey Tempeh Bacon, Creamy Blue Cheese and BBQ Sauce.\n\nI did not particularly enjoy this one. Now, it could've been because I was already full from one burger + shake, but the quinoa and mushroom patty just broke apart as I was handling the burger, and it was surprisingly dry. The \"bleu cheese\" was eerily similar to the real thing, but the BBQ sauce was overpowering. I'd skip this one. \n\nSo NLB is upfront with their food-handling, and they have told me on instagram (letmesq1thing) that though they have dedicated GF prep areas, there is always a risk of cross-contamination. And that's just standard across the board if you go to a restaurant that isn't 100% GF. That's fine. Something happened tonight, though. \n\nMy partner ordered the quinoa burger: House-made Quinoa and Black Chia Seed Patty topped with Smokey Tempeh Bacon, Cheddar or Swiss Style Cheese, Ketchup and Egg-Free Mayo on a GF bun with guac (she got about a teaspoon's worth, so I suggest you save your money) with a side of tots and a chocolate shake. She asked the cashier about the shakes since \"brownie explosion\" and \"cookies and cream\" don't really scream GF, and she was informed that every single shake was GF. She was also informed that the house made tempeh bacon and every other ingredient of her meal was GF.\n\nWe don't know what exactly did it, but the gluten hit her like a truck, and we made it down the escalator to the actual market floor when she couldn't fight it anymore and succumbed to the pain, telling me we had to go home. She is now lying on the couch, having taken anti-inflammatories to mitigate the pain. \n\nCross-contamination is always a risk, and whenever she gets it, she gets minor joint and muscle pain with a minor headache. This wasn't cross-contamination--this was full on gluten. \n\nSince we don't know exactly what element of her meal caused it, we unfortunately won't be able to go back. And that's a shame because of that brownie explosion. \n\nRegardless if you're vegan or not, I recommend this NLB AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT HAVE CELIACS OR ARE VERY VERY VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO GLUTEN (aka you probably have celiacs).", "author": "Hooney H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-26", "description": "I was happy to see this plant based burger joint when exiting Whole Foods today and was excited to try some things. Unfortunately I ended up wasting 25+ minutes in line with about 4/5 other customers without a single staff member working the register. There was no one to greet us or to take our order. Anyone would assume this place was closed except for the fact a few employees would peer out from the kitchen window and there were a few customers sitting and waiting for their orders. I never saw one of these people served the entire time I waited. How long does it take to make a burger and fries?  Finally I saw one employee make her way to a table to tell a customer that his gluten free burger could not be made because the GF grill wasn't working. I don't understand why she wouldn't tell he people in line this so they wouldn't be wasting their time either.\n\nI was really wanting to like this place but I finally left. I realized if the staff doesn't care about their customers enough to greet them or take their orders they probably don't care enough to make a good product.  This was a terrible first impression.

Heard great things about the food, liked the menu. Even heard the staff was friendly/courteous. I was disappointed on all fronts.\n\nPerson taking me and my girlfriend's order was initially great: friendly/complimentary. A good vibe. At the end of us paying for our order, he gave us our flag, and we asked for some cups so that we could pour ourselves some water from the water spout they have on the counter for customers. He said that he'd give us cups when our order was brought out. That seemed kind of wack, since all he had to do was grab two paper cups from a stack of them that was only a couple steps away from him and hand them to us, and there wasn't anyone on line behind us or anything. But, whatever, not a big deal.\n\nWe waited at a table right in front of where the food comes out, our flag prominently displayed. After about 10 min a server passed by with an order that seemed to resemble ours, but we weren't sure because we'd never ordered the items before. She passed us a few times, never once looking in our direction, so we assumed it wasn't for us. Remember: we were at a table directly in front of where the food comes out. Hard to miss us. Ultimately she brought the order to another table, talked to that table, and then brought the order back behind the counter, once again walking right by us, never once looking at us. I then watched as they proceeded to pack the entire order up into to-go containers, put the containers in a bag, and then sit the bag on the back counter by where the food comes out.\n\nWe decided that must have been a take-out order or something, probably not our food, just something that looked familiar. 10 min passed. Then another 10 min. By that point we had watched several people that came there well after us get their food. And also had time to watch an employee wipe a messy gooey table off with a rag, then proceed to use that now dirty rag to wipe down two seats. Instant cheesy seat for someone to sit down on.\n\nAfter a long time, we looked at our receipt and noticed that the table number on it didn't match the red table number that was given to us to put on our table --the whole way that they're able to figure out who to bring the orders to. We deduced that this must be why the person trying to deliver our food didn't ask us if it was ours, but then why did they ask the other tables also with different numbers if it was theirs? So we explained to the cashier that maybe he gave us the wrong number, and that maybe the food they couldn't find the table for was ours. \n\nHe confirmed that this was what happened, apologized, and handed us the same long cold bag of food. We'd never mentioned take out, had even said eating in multiple times, but he insisted we'd asked for it bagged. He then said that our order might not have sweet potato fries like we asked, might have regular fries underneath the toppings. Lovely. Wouldn't open the container to check for us.\n\nWe left the area to sit down at one of the other tables in the 365 area. We did so, opened up our food, and saw that we had been no dressing for our cobb salad. So we then had to go back and get dressing for that.\n\nBy the time we finally ate, the meal was expectedly soggy and lukewarm and lackluster. But I could tell the food wouldn't have been much better even if it was hot. The chili cheese hot dog was covered with cheese, and barely any chili. The dog was the same kind of field roast hotdog you can buy downstairs and that I have at home, which are good dogs, but if I'm eating out somewhere I expect more than store-bought. The bun too was 365. Again, something I could make at home: except if I did so at home, I'd use more chili than just a spoonful, and less cheese than a glassful. Oh, also, there were thin shavings of red onion on the side of the hot dog, probably a teaspoonful. Maybe they were supposed to go on top? They barely tasted like onion. I've never had red onion so barely taste like anything.\n\nThe cobb salad was extremely watery and bland. It tasted like it had been rained on, washing all the flavor away. And the avocado in it wasn't ripe at all. Very hard and actually difficult to chew. I've never had an avocado difficult to chew in my life. They must special-order difficult to chew avocados or something.\n\nThe bleu BBQ fries (sweet potato--they got it right, unbeknownst to the guy) were smothered in the same cheddar cheese that was on the hot dog. No creamy bleu-- or if there was, it tasted exactly like the cheddar and was mixed in like crazy. There was also no smokey tempeh bacon on it, and i tasted no BBQ sauce. It was basically just soggy, mushy sweet potato fries covered in gluey orange goop. If you like your fries crispy, you've come to the wrong place. I could barely tell if they were even fried. (We asked for them fried.)\n\nWe barely finished our food, threw what was left out, and both agreed we'd never come here again. $30+ down the drain.", "author": "Cody C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-18", "description": "Was so excited to try these guys out - as a big fan of vegan comfort food - and already can't wait to go back and try more stuff.\n\nThe Next Level Dog is ridiculously good - the diced cucumbers and black sesame seeds are unexpectedly perfect texture and flavor additions - and they toast the bun beautifully.

They gave us someone else's order. We didn't notice before we got home (15 min away) we went back, asked for our burgers ( 2 GF my fianc\u00e9 is allergic to gluten) . When we arrived the cashier asked the guy in the back to remake our burger. He says \" no I don't, there they are\" He wanted us to get the cold burgers. I was not ok with it, I insisted to get new burgers. He was not happy. They finally made them again, give them to the girl in the front. She checked \"the avocados are missing \" She send them back.

Wait a second, let's check this time... just to be careful... we checked... my fianc\u00e9's burger is still missing the avocado... We went back to the cashier and asked for the missing avocado...
