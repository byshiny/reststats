Big menu selection, healthy options, and reasonable prices, especially when they've got sit-down service too.

The food, though not served in the biggest of proportions, is very good and you can't go wrong with most of what is on their menu. What makes them really great is their smoothies. Every smoothie on their menu is delicious and well priced, and that alone keeps me coming back.", "author": "Robert A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-11", "description": "Bison burger can be pretty dope from here... the delivery time and quality can be absolute shit.", "author": "Kyle D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-24", "description": "Excited for this 2nd location considering that I am regularly in this neighborhood shopping at Trader Joes.

The atmosphere is bright and clean, and everything looked fresh. The prices for lunch and dinner are right, especially considering the enormous portions they give you. The Thai Lettuce Wraps were good, but a little too spicy for me. The Vegetable Panini was just ok, though. They also have smoothies, make-your-own salads and a giant catering menu. Overall, I would definitely go back but do wish the place was a little more cozy or 'stay a while'-ish.", "author": "Danielle M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-09", "description": "Used to love this place... now they suck... food is no longer tasty and way over priced.

Went for breakfast with one other person and though the waitress was very accommodating of our rush order we still waited a considerable amount of time for her to pour us coffee.

Everything is made fresh. And it's easy via Seamless web (I despise calling restaurants on the phone).  BUT -- I wouldn't recommend eating in there, as the experience is a little awkward.  The servers don't exactly wait on you (also: practically everything is garnished with stale tortilla chips and limp fruit).  Your best bet is to keep trying different items until you find your stand-bys (and accept the fact that you'll have to re-season the food yourself at home -- it's \"healthy\", remember).  My recommendation: grilled salmon with steamed vegetables, and an order of brown rice on the side.  Mix it all up and pour a bottle of soy sauce on it.  I get it delivered once a week.  Omega 3s, baby!  (The \"Oh California\" wrap is also a great choice for lunch -- grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, and tabasco)", "author": "Matt D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-02", "description": "Ordered delivery off their gigantic menu which is probably why they screwed it up..they have too many options they cant even handle it.  Ordered one of their \"bowls\" over brown rice. Food arrives 75 minutes later (they said 45 minutes over phone when I ordered), and there is a whole bunch of beans in this thing. Menu says nothing about it. I called and asked WTF, and they were shocked that beans ended up in my order. They said they'd send a new one over. This time only took 20 minutes. No brown rice at all this time.

I asked the two girls who were serving me about the offer and neither of them had heard about it.  Finally the one girl told me it was during certain hours only.  Which was kind of annoying because it was part of the reason I had chosen this place for breakfast.  So no smoothie for me, which was a bad way to start off.\n\nBut I tried to have an enjoyable meal anyway.  And it was mediocre at best.  The place has the atmosphere of a cafeteria and the service wasn't great.   I got the breakfast wrap and my friend got the strawberry and banana pancakes.  Both were totally bland.  I had to douse mine in ketchup to make it tasty.  Healthy does not have to mean flavorless.  \n\nWill definitely not return.", "author": "Prosper P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-01", "description": "I used a Groupon to try out the place.

Perhaps a bit too heavy on the giant carrots but still good. Eating there unfortunately requires pointless table service that only succeeded in wasting my time. Strangely the food came quickly but getting the wait staff's attention and waiting for the check were annoying.

I ordered the steak sandwich, which was frankly so good I wondered if it was actually low calorie. There seemed to be a LOT of steak in it, which may negate the point of eating at a \"health food\" place to cut back on calories. Boyfriend ordered the so-called meat lovers pizza, which only allowed one meat choice. He got bison and it was ultra-bland. Delivery was pretty fast and they didn't mess anything up.

At first I was really excited to find health-conscious food in this part of town.
