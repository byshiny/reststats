We waited for about an hour and half in freezing cold and ended up leaving half of our pizza untouched. We were visiting from Atlanta and were sooooooo looking forward to some authentic New York pizza but were completely let down. The pizza lacked any sort of robust flavor and the ingredients were less than amazing. Compared to Antico's, my favorite pizza joint in Atlanta which imports all their ingredients straight from Napoli, Grimaldi's deserves 2 stars at most. \n\nVery disappointed!!", "author": "Yichen K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-04", "description": "Best bang for the buck.

An hour wait to get in.  They don't even allow call in \"to go\" orders.  But OMG!  What a pizza!

I am a crust girl), great tomatoes, thinly sliced fresh mozzarella cheese and other fresh ingredients make this pizza soooooo worth the wait!\n\nThey couldnt pack in another table if they tried.  The place is always so full that the dishwasher on a break was sitting eating his pizza on a chest freezer.  Autographed pictures of Frank Sinatra line one wall and along the other long wall are photos of all the famous people who have also stood on line to partake of the Grimaldi's experience!\n\nHey, I am a professional chef and a farmer's market addict!

I guess when people just line up for hours they have to make themselves feel better by telling themselves the food was good. The pizza is always amazing in Brooklyn which is another reason why this place sucks so bad. It is also not really that cheap not to mention they sell whole pies only LOL. This place is the worst. There are other places nearby that are way better but I guess if you're in NYC, try this one????

The pizza use to be so much better here as I remember. By the time the pies made it to our table it was cold, tough and rubbery. The dough had no crunch to it and it was dry. There however still is a line out the door and around the block, probably because tourists only know of this place and Lombardi's when it comes to pizza.. But in my opinion there are better pies and slices to be had in the city.\nSorry Grimaldi's but you've been downgraded!", "author": "Mehreen W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-09", "description": "Good pizza.

I've always been a fan of just regular 'ol pizza, loaded with toppings so to simplify it made me raise my eyebrow a bit. Well, Grimaldi's was a good first experience because I can honestly say I am now open to thin crusts (if they're made the Grimaldi's way hehe). We saw the line at 11 AM and thought we'd have to wait at least an hour. Luckily, the pizza gods were with us and decided to have the large corner table open to accommodate our group of seven right away (I tried to avoid eye contact with the people who were waiting in line ahead of us). I heard italian being spoken and a bunch of guys that looked like they knew pizza. Very fast paced with oldies music playing. \n\nWe ordered a regular pizza and a white pizza. I will always love a white pizza over a regular one with tomato sauce in any circumstance. Maybe because I'm a fatty and just love cheese and cream sauce, but I just love the richness of it all. The crust was very good, thin yet kind of buttery and a good consistency. Sauce was over the cheese on the regular one, and you can tell that it was fresh tomato, the freshest tomato sauce I've ever had. The white pizza was chock full of garlic but I looove garlic so I just about wanted to eat the whole pie myself. Eat fast though, because once it cools down the cheese got pretty rubbery.\n\nI stowed all of this carefully in my mind as I was determined to try Lombardi's later on during my trip, but Grimaldi's got a running start.", "author": "Stephanie T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-17", "description": "One of the best pizza places in the city.

Possibly even prepared to stand there for two hours to try the famed Grimaldi's. \n\nWell ... I gotta say ... and I hardly ever swear, but ...\n\nNO WAIT, B*TCHES!!!! \n\n:-) \n\nScalding hot out of the oven, the pizza's crust has a tasty hint of charcoal, but because the fresh tomato sauce is so hot, the crust got soggy really fast. The best part was definitely the globs of cheese and the thick coins of pepperoni (we ordered half pepperoni \u0026 mushroom, half sausage \u0026 mushroom).\n\nEven though the pizza was very, very good, it wasn't the best I've ever had. *squeaks* It wasn't even the best pie I had that trip (you guys gotta try Zuppardi's in Connecticut). \n\nGrimaldi's is definitely an institution and not just all hype. I would definitely try it.
