My dad loved this dish, but for me it was ok. (I make better latkes, hehe.) However, the apple sauce was out of this world. I wish they had given us a larger portion of it. It was enough for the two latkes, but barely enough for me to bathe myself in, like I would've wanted.\n\nI ordered one of their specials, the shepherd's pie with mushroom gravy. It was delicious. Heavy with thyme. I added a little bit of salt though to enhance the flavors.\n\nMy fiance ordered the chicken marsala and he enjoyed it immensely! I didn't even know he ate chicken marsala!\n\nMy dad ordered the spaghetti bolognese and his girlfriend the chicken soup.

(Oddly enough, we were also the only ones there at noon on a weekday.)\n2. Food - we ordered a couple of dishes, including the farm bowl which comes with two eggs over easy, brussels sprouts, and cabbage dumplings. The brussels sprouts were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the dumplings were delicious. We also ordered the pancakes, which were flavorless and rubbery (which is particularly sad if you love pancakes). The organic syrup was a really nice touch and the only thing that made the pancakes edible. \n3. Ambience - The ambience is beautiful, elegant, and peaceful. Think shabby sheik without the shabby! The floral centerpieces are gorgeous and the whole place looks like it's ready for a photo shoot.\n\nWeird factor: at the end of our meal the waiter (owner?) asked if we would write a yelp review in exchange for free dessert. What made it even more uncomfortable was that he asked if he could read the review after it was written. \"I want to see what you write,\" he said. This makes it impossible to be honest if you have something negative to say (I assume he knows this, which is why he asked to read it). Also, restaurants are not supposed to bribe their customers. I've been yelping for a long time, and this is the first time something like this has happened. It was so awkward.\n\nOverall, The Kitchen is a good restaurant with lovely ambience and wonderful service. Skip the pancakes and skip the bribery, and you're golden.", "author": "Ray J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-03", "description": "Fabulous food at reasonable prices, cute place and very attentive, friendly and thoughtful service.

Food was reasonably priced, and I got my eggs benedict for $12. Came with salad and potatoes. It was a good, better than what I was expecting after reading the reviews for this place! And then I used the Yelp check-in deal for a free slice of carrot cake that we split. So we had a pretty solid brunch for an incredibly affordable price and I can't complain about that. Give it a chance.", "author": "Myles C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-11-12", "description": "I have been here on two occasions and on both of those occasions, I ran into problems. I was there last night and it was significantly worse than the already challenged first time. The only reason I would suggest you come to this restaurant is if it is at a convenient time and place. It is almost directly across from the Cobble Hill movie theater and that is what brought me there for these two visits. How to quickly summarize this restaurant, I would say that the quality of the food is mediocre and the service is beyond subpar. \nYESTERDAY:  entered at 6.32,\u0026 didnt receive entrees before 7.35. there were 2 servers and 2 bussers, for the entire establishment, and this understaffing was beyond obvious. I barely even knew who our server was  bc  we mostly interacted with a busser who then apparently carried the message to the server, like a game of telephone. on this occasion I happened to be quite hungry so I was naturally annoyed that I was not even able to order a drink, let alone any food, for over 20 minutes. We finally ordered one cocktail each as well as 3 crostinis as an appetizer-the appetizer arrived at the table over 20mins later \u0026we still hadnt received our drinks which I then pointed out. In another 5+minutes, our drinks arrived. I got the Hemingway daiquiri($14) and was disappointed taste-wise and presentation wise. Knowing how slow everything there went, we also ordered our entrees at the same time that we ordered our appetizer. We got two entrees and shared them both. (worth noting that the last time I was there I ordered a burger(about $15) \u0026asked that the aoili be put on the side but when it arrived, the aioli was on the burger but my partner knew complaining would cause another great delay so she had to wipe all the aioli off the burger.) Yesterday's Burger I ordered with cheese and when it finally came out, there was no cheese but as during our last visit, we didn't bother mentioning it, fearing how much time that could've taken. Our second entree was Pasta Bolognese(about $12) and it was tasty enough but not at all memorable. I also found it interesting that they did not offer any parmesan cheese and\u0026upon asking for it, a small side was brought to the table. This might sound a little nitpicky but since I ordered a burger on both visits, with fries on the side, the tiny amount of ketchup brought with the dish was something I again, \u0026on both occasions, had to ask for more of. On the plus side, the crostinis ($4 each) we ordered were very good - tried a spinach based one \u0026 a hummus based one.\nWe had one dessert on our first visit and it definitely didn't taste like it was homemade and once again I would have to say it was just mediocre. \nDecor, underwhelmed - tiny vase w cheap half-dead flowers that reminded me of a funeral.\nImpatient and annoyed,  I  was very assertive in asking for the check  on my own  as opposed to waiting for someone  to come to our table and ask if we were ready for it. Overall, my visit yesterday was almost stressful and anxiety provoking because so many things were done so inadequately... and I was definitely not prepared for or anticipating the whole experience to be over an hour and a half. If I hadn't pursued having the check brought to us, I'm guessing the experience would have been at least 10 minutes longer.", "author": "Michelle K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-12-01", "description": "CASH + AMEX only. When has anyone ever heard this????????\n\n1. The food was fine, but they were missing some menu items and failed to inform that they substituted ingredients before serving us! Then asked us if it was okay after they set the food down on the table? What kind of restaurant etiquette is that?!\n2. The menus posted outside were not accurate to the menu being served on the inside of the restaurant. They told us the \"menus changed recently,\" but why is it still being advertised in the window? Take it down, you made new menus so don't tell people you're serving food you don't have.\n3. This would be a 3 star review if they accepted major credit cards. They don't. They also don't tell you that anywhere outside the building or on the entrance, so they get you at the end by saying \"it's cash or AMEX only and there's a $1 ATM in the back.\" I'm sorry, excuse me, you don't take credit cards but you take AMEX? What kind of shady business dealing is this? Also the ATM in the back is not like one I've ever seen before.\n\nOverall majorly dissatisfied, had high hopes for this place, but will not be returning.
