(Although in my opinion they could improve the back patio a little bit more) \n\nI chose Salmon Teriyaki lunch special on their menu. It came with a miso soup and vegetables salad with ginger dressing. Not to mention that it was served with California Roll, Edamame, a portion of corn and greens. It was delicious and sumptuous for a $10 value.\n\nWe washed down our meal with a cold bottle of beer. The staff are great and we did not have to wait very long for our food to be ready.

I was in the neighborhood and was craving for sushi. Ordered their chicken teriyaki bento box. It came with California roll, edamame, shui Meis, miso soup and salad. I never had a bento box accompany edamame so that was a plus. It  as a raining day and they were flooded with their take out orders. The waitress was attentive. Overall service was good. My entire lunch was $10.89. Last but not least, it was a bit too dim inside. It was probably due to raining and cloudy day. Should have turn on the light a bit to brighten the mood.", "author": "Weiming L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-01-20", "description": "Ordered take out \u0026 was very disappointed.

This is the reason I will drive from Queens to Brooklyn to have dinner at this place.  * Correction * this is the reason I will nag and plead with my bf to take me to dinner at Kyoto Sushi!  \n\nThe PEPPER SHRIMP is a delectable entree and a shrimp dish that is hard to find anywhere else.  The jumbo size morsels are truly huge, and they give you plenty of it.  I have honestly not had such a dish at any other Japanese restaurant I've been to.  In fact, I don't even know what makes this dish \"Japanese\" but I don't even care, it's simply that good.  An order will consist of about 10 pieces of this delicious, fresh, slightly spicy, crispy, and juicy, jumbo shrimp, white rice, and miso soup.  For $13, that is remarkable.  \n\nTrue story.............. a few weeks ago we went on vacation somewhere in the Caribbean (don't remind me, I am still in withdrawal), to an island touted for fresh seafood, and though we had an incredible time, and enjoyed quality food during our stay, I hearkened back to the memory of Kyoto's Pepper Shrimp dish one night, as I had had a similar shrimp dish while on vacation and it just could not compare with Kyoto's far superior dish.  And, it was also very pricey at almost $25 for the entree.  So, as soon as we got back to the States, I asked my bf to bring me to Kyoto so that I could redeem that shrimp meal, ha.  \n\nNow, if they ever take the Pepper Shrimp off the menu for whatever reason, I have no reason to go back to Kyoto if I am not in Brooklyn, specifically in that neighborhood!!", "author": "Jennifer C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-02", "description": "Kyoto did its job of satisfying my hunger, and that's about it. \n\nI ordered a spicy tuna and spicy salmon roll to go. The food came out quick. Too quick. I get home to find a long hair connecting from a piece of sushi to under the ginger. Not happy at all. \n\nThe sushi was mediocre at best. Their rolls had very little rice on it and the fish was oozing out while in the tray. \n\nGreat place if you're starving and want real cheap sushi. Otherwise, go across the street to Ki Sushi.", "author": "Just B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-11", "description": "Kyoto Sushi serves up standard affordable take out sushi with a friendly neighborhood vibe. Eating in is comfortable for a casual date and comes with good service. Menu is skewed toward making you order rolls, although you can also have plates of sushi, sashimi, chirashi, a $30 omakase, teriyaki, and noodles. The menu is large and varied, and of what we tried the food is solid. \n\nKyoto is popular with the neighborhood and had a decent in house audience for a place that is well known with the take out crowd. There is seating for 35, so not a big place. Tends to be a bit dim in here during the day and in the evenings. If you have a group of 8, coming early would probably be sufficient, and they can merge enough tables together for the group. Anything larger than that may be overwhelming for other diners. Solo diners are very welcome here, with multiple two top tables or the option to eat at the bar in front of the sushi masters.\n\nPerry I and I were looking for a light dinner and ordered:\nMiso eggplant\nOshitashi (cold spinach)\nYellowtail roll\nYummy roll (spicy salmon topped with salmon/tuna/yellowtail)\n\nFor a neighborhood not-fancy sushi joint, the quality and portion sizes were fantastic. We enjoyed all of our dishes and they were brought out in the order they were finished by the kitchen in a nice rotation of tasty options. The service is attentive, but not obtrusive, and very patient. And for $30, we ate really well.", "author": "Suanne L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-30", "description": "I love their spicy crunchy shrimp rolls and the shrimp shumai's.

After a meeting at work my manager, some coworkers and I decided to go here from lunch. We had a very rude waiter who seemed very annoyed with his job. We split the bill between four cards and when the waiter came to take the checkbook he snatched it and started to check in front of us how much we all gave him in tips. After not being satisfied he gave us the book back and demanded that we give him more! WHERE DO THEY DO THAT AT? I put the checkbook down and continued to walk out because the meal was paid for and the tip was given, he then followed me outside yelling that this isn't right.

The delivery called me first and I told him I would be outside soon and he left the building, so I was waiting for him outside and called him back. The total of the food was $9.80 but when I asked him, he said $10.00 and like an idiot I gave him $2.00 tip. I was so ready to give him less than that.\n\nFood:\nSweet Potato roll and Boston roll were actually and surprisingly well made and the shrimps were slightly sweet and meaty, just the way I like it. I didn't like that there was  avocado in the Boston roll cause typically it comes with just shrimp, cucumber, and lettuce.\n\nI was quite surprised because they gave me edamame which I absolutely love. I prefer it served chilled and slightly cold, but some restaurants serve it fresh and hot. Shumai was included in the lunch special, it was nothing special. The green salad, was just your usual salad, also nothing special.\n\nI like the quality of their food, but I don't think I will be a returning customer since the delivery man doesn't seem to have a lot of patience to wait and thanks for charging me an extra 20 cents, guy.", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-21", "description": "The empire roll was SO good.
