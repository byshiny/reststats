I ordered the classic burger with pepper jack and special sauce and it was the BEST burger I've had since my carnivorous five guys days. I'm not kidding, it was epic! The meaty patty reminded me of a Boca burger except less artificial and tastier. But the star of the show wasn't the patty, it was the special sauce. OMG!! That special sauce is truly special. Remember that movie Good Burger? Remember their special sauce and how much you always wanted to try it? I think this may be the closest we ever get to it. So, to sum it all up my burger was fantastic. The patty was tasty, the bun was good, all the usual burger fixings were fresh, tasty and pretty to look at, the sauce was epic and my oven baked fries were crunchy and yummy. You get two thumbs up from this gal.\n\nP.s. the service was excellent. The woman who took my order was kind and quite cheerful. Midway through my meal a staff member came through and asked everyone if everything was to their liking. My mouth was full so I could only contribute two secret sauce covered thumbs up. \n\nI'll be back.", "author": "Yomaira H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-09", "description": "Okay update to my review it's still a solid 4 if you know what to get my mushroom quinoa burger which was their signature burger with vegan pepper jack was so flavorful and just filling and delicious. \n\nThe blue cheese burger was good too but I preferred mushroom one more.

But I opted for the signature burger!!\nThe fries weren't good they weren't cooked throughout but I think it's coz they weren't fried!! \n\nBut the strawberry milkshake with coconut milk was so deliciously dreamy and creamy and they gave the extra one on the side which was nice me and my boyfriend literally shared one milkshake and it was enough for both of us.  \n\nDefinitely slowly but surely it's becoming my go to place.

It's located conveniently in a food court-like area so it seems to be a great post grocery-shopping hangout spot. I came here for lunch yesterday, and there were plenty of seats inside. As a plant-based burger joint, it was nice to see how they have \"meaty\" burgers (soy) and veggies burgers (quinoa/mushroom/bean based) for those who like the flavor of meat and for those who actually want a complete veggie burger. I got the classic meaty burger and mushroom cheese fries (was going to get tots, but they heard the order wrong o well). \n\nThe burgers are served on sprouted grain bun by default, but gluten free buns are available too. It's hard to believe all of these are plant-based when it came as everything was extremely filling and I had to take the fries to go. The mushroom cheese fries had a hint of truffle flavor, and the fries are seasoned nicely with a house spice instead of\nPlain salt.

The burgers are small, but filling if you get a regular-sized side. Love that you have the option of baked or fried tots. Downside is the baked tots were heavily salted.

I was pleasantly surprised with how well it held up (more structured than say, the Impossible Burger). Texture was kinda lacking though, and visually, it looked like a cardboard puck.

But honestly, not as good as the west coast spots of the same chain. The burgers are all good, especially the ones with vegan bacon, but I have noticed that they're *wetter* or more oily than I'd like a burger to be. Hot off the grill is great, but it seeps into the bun and I usually end up feeling weird as I'm rushing to finish it so the bread stays intact. \n\nThe milkshakes here are some of the best vegan milkshakes I've had in my life. Honestly and truly, they beat out Champs and all the other vegan spots by a long shot. The one downside to Next level is the pricing, its a bit expensive for a semi-shared dining area with Whole Foods and a few other food spots and the service is always meh, never excellent.

While everything was good, nothing was uniquely tasty. I tried the Quinoa burger and the quinoa black chia patty was pretty plain. The swiss cheese was simply a barely melted slice of Daiya. I thought the burger was supposed to have tempeh bacon but I didn't get any. The bun is soft and is on the sweeter side. I ordered a side of tater tots, which had the perfect amount of salt. However, I realized later that the cashier didn't ask me whether I wanted them baked or fried. \n\nMore than anything else, I was excited to try their vegan shakes. I got coconut as the base because I try to stay away from soy. This was a mistake, though, because coconut took over the entire thing. Instead of a thick chocolate shake I expected from the Brownie Explosion, it was more a coconut shake with a little bit of chocolate pieces.
