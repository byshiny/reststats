Everything I've had there is fine, but nothing worth remembering. The reason I give it three stars is because the juices are expensive but really great and fresh!! The hangover juice is my absolute favorites.

I haven't had anything extraordinary here though. \n\nI ordered a protein strawberry shake and it was actually disgusting. I gave it away because of how poor it tastes. \n\nThe staff is pretty friendly and its relatively spacious. its a good spot for a quick healthy lunch but not something i would seek.", "author": "Amanda R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-09", "description": "Food is good, I had the natural grill bowl. It had grilled chicken and bison with brown rice. It has a good amount of meat and rice, however the price for the bowl came out to 14$ without a drink! So you can say they are pricey. It's a nice eatery, you can go in and have a seat and eat your meal. What I found cool is that they have organic wine and beer, I dont think I've ever had that. The only thing is that everything on the menu is pricey.", "author": "Duvesh N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-21", "description": "Walking in at 9:25 to order something quick to eat and go. Look at menu for 5 minutes and then waiter comes to me after I looked at him. I say I'd like the burger..., and he immediately chimes in \"just to let you know we close in 20 minutes. Can you take it to go?\". I say how long will it take? He says 15 minutes. I say okay don't worry. I stand up to leave and he goes to the kitchen to check how long a single burger will take to cook and then comes back and says yeah it's going to take 15 minutes. It's 9:30 so you close in a half hour, get a watch. I own a quick service restaurant and would fire the entire staff immediately if this was my place.", "author": "John G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-11", "description": "Nice place for lunch. They got good variety of choices. Rice bowl are delicious,. They are bit pricey but big enough for two people. \nDice it was very tasty, with lots of veggies and chicken. Perfect to eat while still hot. \nThe seared ahi tuna wrap was a bit bland. The tuna was cooked perfectly but the peppers, lettuce and that sauce overwhelmed the tuna.", "author": "Alicia C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-09", "description": "Obsessed. My husband introduced me to this place and I've been hooked ever since. Natures Grill makes healthy taste delicious!\n\nOnly downside is that I feel it's kinda pricey considering.

It was ok. I'm not a black bean burger kind of chic, but wanted something on the vegetarian side....\nThe menu is pretty extensive, so I'd probably return to try something else.", "author": "Lyn D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-11", "description": "I came it at 9:24 (it's 9:30 pm now) for the 2 person meal for $49 that is until 10 pm. I was told I couldn't get it because it's only at tables and they aren't taking tables. \n\nI'm mostly posting in case Managment cares how the establishment is being run. If a sign says a special until 10 but you don't take tables at 9:24, it would be worth changing your signage to reflect that. \n\nShame really.

The place is good in terms of quality, variety, and service. It is pricey for what they serve, but there's also no other spot like it around. I come here about 1x a week.

We were craving a good salad and stumbled upon yelp reviews for Nature's Grill- which luckily was a few storefronts down. The restaurant itself is super cute and modern- 2 booths on alternate sides of the entrance, many 2 seaters and a few tables for 4. There menu is Cheesecake Factory level HUGE- but with much healthier options! Additionally they sell organic wines and beer. If I'm not mistaken they had a gluten free beer as well. The salad section had many options. I decided on the Guadalajara salad with chicken (I subbed carrot/ginger dressing for the fat free choice they had paired with this salad) My fianc\u00e9 chose the Greek salad. The portions were sufficient to fill me up and still have leftovers for today's lunch (woohoo!) I would definitely recommend going here for a healthy lunch or dinner.", "author": "Saira W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "Love this spot.
