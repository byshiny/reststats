I paid $3.50 for a large cup mostly filled with ice, and had to wait a good several minutes for it. I also asked for one sugar and the coffee was so sweet it was barely drinkable. Pastries are lame -- I think the croissants are from Sysco. Too bad for a neighborhood place with very pleasant owners.", "author": "Jen B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-03", "description": "The scones are awesome, the carrott muffin is delicious, the coffee is ok, and the cashier always has a smile on her face.
