Check into yelp for a free glass of the wine that they offer. To start we got the butter salad and a burrata. They were both amazing and very tasty. The butter salad is very refreshing with the bean curds and the vinegar dressing. When the weather gets nicer you can sit outside on the patio and see the beautiful view of the city.  For the pizza we got the bresaola, burrata, wild mushroom, parmigiano. It was very tasty! And for the pasta we got the tagliatelle, beef bolognese. It was delicious. Lastly for dessert we got the sorbet and tiramisu. Tiramisu is a must have.

The place was not so crowded to excuse how long it too for the courses to arrive. We waited probably 45 minutes despite having a reservation and arriving a little early.\nHowever the food was delicious (I had the truffle pasta.), the service was friendly and attentive, and the space itself is a pretty location with an amazing view.\nThey have a huge bar and I could see it being a cozy stop for sightseers in Brooklyn.", "author": "christine a."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-25", "description": "Delicious food!

Bravo to the creator the look is much appreciated and right up my alley.  Had a great Aperol Spritz.  My daughter loved her buffalo pizza and me and my husband'a pasta was cooked to perfection.  Incredible taste!

I came here with my friends for my birthday dinner, and it was the perfect vibe. The look and feel is very Soho House-does-Italian restaurant, which I personally really like. Lots of velvet and leather and deep teal and black. The bar and pizza oven setup is very charming, and they had live music the night I was there.\n\nBut let's be real, the main reason to come is that view! It's quite amazing. I had a great spot facing the bridge (it was my birthday, after all) and it totally set the mood for what was an amazing evening. I loved watching the trains slide through the bridge like silver snakes, and the boats glide through the silver waters of the East River. \n\nI actually felt the food was quite good. Standouts were the truffle zucchini flower pizza, the eggplant parmesan and the delicious citrus berry meringue/pavlova thing for dessert (I forget the actual name) which was more than enough for 6 girls in our case. \n\nOne thing that my friends and I didn't love was a garden spritzer they had on the menu. It tasted very herbaceous, which was not at all what we were expecting when looking at the ingredients. Next time, I'll stick with my tried-and-true Aperol spritz.\n\nI'd love to come back during the daytime now that it's getting warmer, and sit on the patio. Price points were reasonable all things considered (real estate, especially). Worth the schlep out to BK for Manhattanites. Great idea for visitors, but also charming for all but the most hardened of New Yorkers.", "author": "Anna G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-16", "description": "Cecconi's never disappoints. I've been to Cecconi's a few times but never for half off Monday's. Although it was quite busy, the staff had no problem seating my group. The staff at the front was very friendly and instantly made us feel welcomed and at ease. \n\nCecconi's has many pluses that most certainly starts with it's location and close proximity to the waterfront. Cecconi's is also very accessible to transportation and the ferry. If you do go to Cecconi's, I recommend that you go early and explore the area and places (waterfront, museums) in located above and around Cecconi's. You won't be disappointed. \n\nAs for the food, Cecconi's has to be the best restaurants in the area if not the whole of Dumbo. As I mentioned, when we entered, the staff sat us quickly and our waiter took our drink orders and served us throughout our meal flawlessly. I can't say enough about the Cecconi's team. Everyone knows their job and all are quite knowledge about the Cecconi's brand. \n\nI highly recommend going to Cecconi's and becoming a friend of Cecconi's. Once a member, I highly recommend that you take advantage of the special nights and perks for their local followers.", "author": "Percy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-18", "description": "My impression of Cecconi's was soured from the moment we got there. We had a table reservation, however a party was already at the table and in no hurry to leave. Almost an hour later we were forced to take another table. There seemed to be way too many wait staff working at the same time creating confusion, and a vibe of anxiety in the room. Our table's order was messed up twice, but there were so many different people tending to our table it was hard to figure out who knew what was going on. Really disappointing experience.", "author": "Matt M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-10", "description": "One of my fav restaurants  - doesn't matter if it's dumbo or inside Soho house in Miami. They could do no wrong. Amazing service, delicious food. Great portions, good quality, decent pricing. The decor and atmosphere is great. I usually opt for their lobster spaghetti. Definitely recommend. Finished off lunch with a tiramisu. Plus, Dumbo location has a great view so outdoor seating is a great option.", "author": "Natasha E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-27", "description": "Service is poor. Appetizers did not show up before the main course and server was forgetful about drinks that were ordered. I had The tagliatelle... I wouldn't ride all the way from Harlem for the food here.... ambiance and view was great. Would probably be alright just for drinks....", "author": "Brittni D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-10", "description": "So Cecconi's in Dumbo is exactly what I suspected it would be: overpriced and a little bit bougie.\n\nAs soon as we walked in I got an unwelcomed vibe from the hostesses and even with a reservation it took several minutes for our group to be seated - almost like they were trying to decide where to put us.\n\nWhen finally seated it took a while for the waiter to visit.  He was darling once he did arrive... but this should have been a foreshadow to the entire meal.  No matter what we needed - another drink or refill, to place our order, a box, our check - it took for-e-verrrr at Cecconi's.  Don't expect a quick meal... \n\nThat all being said - the restaurant itself is beautiful - especially the bar \u0026 lounge area.  So I guess if you are going to have to sit there and wait - at least you're doing it in a pretty and well decorated room.\n\nFoodwise - I went with one of their pizza's, which I had read were really good.  And it was.  The Spicy Salami was very good, but basic.  And for that $22 price tag I feel like I expected some extra something.  I've had more creatively curated (and delicious) pizzas at other joints around Brooklyn for at least a 1/3 less $$.", "author": "Alyssa R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-24", "description": "We had a great dinner experience at Cecconi's. With 7pm reservations on a Saturday we arrived early to have a drink at the bar, unfortunately the bar was packed so we had to go somewhere else for a pre-dinner drink. However, we came back at 7pm and got a table outdoors with beautiful views over the city. If possible, definitely get a table outside, it's hard to beat those views at sunset. \n\nFor appetizers we had the steak tartare, whipped ricotta and we also got a free pizzetta since I checked in on yelp (brilliant!). The steak tartare was good, I would have loved some more flavors in there, but the meat itself was very good and it came with a crunchy bread. The whipped ricotta with honey was amazing I loved it. I would for sure get this again, so simple yet delicious. \n\nFor the main course we ordered the lobster pasta and veal chop. The lobster pasta was very good. The lobster was fresh and there was a good amount of lobster meat. The saffron and basil flavors went well together. The veal chop was huge and cooked perfectly. The outside was crispy and inside juicy and flavorful. I thought it was a little odd that it didn't come with any sides, it was just one big piece of meat? However, for dessert we had the chocolate tart and pistachio gelato. It's a darker heavy chocolate cake with some sprinkled sea salt on top. Yummy. \n\nOur waitress was attentive and overall the service was good. I would give the food 4 stars, but the views and atmosphere bring up the overall review up to 5.", "author": "Erika S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-11", "description": "The view is a five if you can get a seat of the two bridges.

It was a great experience, since the hosts offered excellent service and the view was out of this world. Really could not get a better view. They had a nice party room that opened up to the outdoor area, overlooking the manhattan bridge. It was surely picturesque.\n\nEverything that we ordered was perfect. The brick chicken, porcheta benedict, burrata salad, and wild salmon were sure hits. The pastries and fruit definitely hit the spot.\n\nI also enjoy coming here for happy hour or for FOC days.

I've been wanting to check this place out for a while since it's so close to my job and I'm all things soho house (fanatic). I've followed articles for months prior to the opening so needless to say it's been a long time coming. From the minute you walk in you're transported into what feels like a restaurant in Rome...from the seating to the lighting down to the ambiance! I took a seat at the bar and decided to have dinner along with my cocktail. Our server was soooo attentive and pleasant which completely elevated my experience... he was so thorough and inviting. I can see myself becoming a regular here by far...for dinner I had the pizzette, calamari and strip steak (Medium). The food was presented in a timely manner and oh so delicious !!! My favorite had to be the Steak as it was tender and oh so flavorful !!!

Came here for my birthday with some friends. We had a reservation but we had to wait like 15-20 min which wasn't ideal. I'm a vegetarian so I was a little concern about not having many options, however, when I looked at the menu they had a good amount to chose from! The food was delicious and the restaurant itself was very nice. The service wasn't great. It was ok but not great. The waiter seemed a little annoyed.

This past Wednesday after a tiring iv treatment at the hospital, my husband decided to take me. We were dressed casually and didn't have a reservation. We would've liked to have sat out on the patio but it was on over an hour to get seated there. But they were able to seat us next to the open doors so we had the breeze and view. I felt a little under dressed, because it was so nice inside. The bar looked stunning and the seating was very comfortable. We decided to split the eggplant parmigiana as a appetizer. OMG, it was sooo good!!! Huge portion!!  I could've just had that as my main and been satisfied. I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the raviolis stuffed w eggplant. Though he loved his sauce, he's not crazy about grape tomatoes which is how his dish was served. He was hoping for a red sauce instead of the white. My salmon was done perfectly, though the pasta that it came with looked more like couscous, I would've preferred a larger pasta like ziti or rigatoni. I would've loved to check out the dessert, but we were stuffed. A reservation is definitely recommended if you'd like a better view. I definitely want to go back and try out their pizzas that looked amazing. We watched as the table next to us had table side service for the Dover sole that they had ordered. Upscale, hipster clientele. A nice restaurant to take a date to or to celebrate a special event. We noticed a party of recent NYU graduates celebrating with their family. In the evening as the sun is setting it's a gorgeous water view of the bridges and Manhattan. We are definitely going back to try out the rest of the menu!!", "author": "Gulhan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-04-20", "description": "View of Brooklyn Bridge is Amazing!  Food was meh... Really.... the Pasta dishes were just Meh.  The wait staff was very friendly but the hostess didn't seem to know where to sit us.  Nothing really stood out to me at this restaurant other than the view and the expensive dishes.  They made a mistake on my friend's dish and made up for it by shaving some truffles on her pasta.  Truffles are Xpensive!  That was a nice gesture.  I'd return for apps and a drink with my friends but I wouldn't go out of my way to pay for parking in Dumbo and $30+ for a pasta dish.", "author": "Lynn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-03", "description": "Big fan of all the Cecconi's restaurants across the globe, but this one here in Dumbo might be my favorite. \n\nFirst off, the views are insane from the patio. If you can snag a table out there, just stay all day and night. Second, their burrata Neapolitan pizza is one of my favorite food items in New York right now. You don't have to be a member of Soho House to dine and it's a close approximation to being a part of the member's experience.\n\nIf you're there on Monday, they have a pretty legit happy hour that I highly recommend checking out if you like great things for little money.", "author": "Ruggy J."}], "servesCuisine": "Italian", "priceRange": "$31-60", "name": "Cecconi\u2019s Dumbo", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "55 Water St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HkjbGNqRM-tIpOXeCmh2sg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17186503900"}
