This place has great decor, great drinks, and really great food. The service was just a bit slow, but that didn't deter me from still giving them a 5 star. They were packed on a Tuesday night, but were able to seat is very quickly. \nI had the snap pea salad and octopus small plate. Both were delicious but the octopus stood out. I stole a bite of my brother's mushroom ragout, and my boyfriend's burger. It was all delicious.

Not only because I ooze that stuff (obviously... not really.... nope,) but because of places like Colonie.\n\nCame here on a Saturday night with my sister and had a brilliant time. We walked in and I immediately felt a sense of calm. The ambiance is classic but trendy; the kind of place you go to if you want to impress a date. All the tables are candlelit. Yet it wasn't annoyingly pretentious (save for the hostess*). Aka, my kind of place. \n\nOh, and the cocktails are great, too! I ordered this cucumber-infused number. Will have to try one of their \"orange\" wines next time (apparently that's a thing) and the food. \n\n*Unlike the bartenders who were super friendly, the hostess was very pretentious and almost seemed bothered by our presence. Maybe she was just having a bad day?", "author": "Shannon G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-04", "description": "January 2015:\nAVOID unless you are a vacuous trust fund kid for whom novelty is more important than quality.  Why you need to be vacuous too?  Because the noise level is so ghastly that you can't even talk to the person 6 inches away from you never mind the waitstaff who fein a preposterous air of self-importance and think ignoring you is their way to salvation.  Of course in their defense the tables are so close together that getting near a patron takes enormous agility and cunning.  The good news is that you cannot hear anything the waiters say and can thus blithely ignore the absurdly overpriced specials - can a burned trout really be worth $36 or a perfectly ordinary hamburger justify an $18 price tag. And yes you have to wait 5 minutes for a waiter to appear whom  you can then beg for ketchup\n\nThe place is modeled on economy class airline seating. If you enjoy sitting in the lap of the patron next to you, this is the place to go.\n\nThe food? a pompous menu offers little choice - 4 entrees when we visited. Yet even so, the food is mediocre and seems largely based on grilling dead things in oil till their skin turns black.  The entrees are \"modestly\" sized and a few florets of some cruciferous vegetable will add an extra $9 to the price.  The $9 side salad had 15 very small leaves of some greenish thing(s): the local green grocer sells the same leaves for 99 cents.  Did I say AVOID?

A perfectly prepped/cooked meal at a very reasonable price. Tonight started w/ a refreshing Persian cucumber salad, a perfect reply to the NYC summer heat. Our main was a squid ink gemelli w/ burrata \u0026 mint and a sumptuous grilled pork chop w/ jersey peaches, shishito peppers and spoon bread.

After that, the octopus was probably the best dish I tried.\n\nPortion sizes were pretty good on most of our dishes.

I got up and walked a few feet and suddenly slipped. Luckily I was able to grab on to the back of someone's chair and picked myself back up and quickly walked to the bathroom. I came back to my seat and still none of the staff approached me and asked if I was fine. I know they saw me bust my a$$ and no one had the courtesy to approach me. One of my friends said it looked like you slipped on cream. How could I have slipped in ankle boots? If my boots were the issue, that means I would have slipped the moment I walked in.

This place could care less.   Had a 6:45 pm dinner reservation for 9/22/17.  We arrived a little early but since happy hour was still going on, we were told we could not be sited.  When it was time and with plenty of empty tables in view, we were told no tables were available. I informed them that this was my wife's birthday but it did not help.

Tables are tight and it is insanely loud so don't expect to have much of a conversation with whoever you are with, but nonetheless, it has a good vibe. \nOur waitress was awesome (Kristin I think) and really set the tone for meal.  She was really good at answering questions with not just an answer but guidance.  When my wife was curious about the iced coffee she said it was awesome and \"came from a keg\". Sure enough it arrived looking like a beer and was perfection.  Strong but not too strong and not too bitter. \nWe went with the eggs Benedict on biscuits and and the duck hash.  \nPresentation was perfect and the dishes looked impressive and were a generous portion size.  \nThe eggs Benedict was very good but the biscuits were seriously undercooked.  I am sure they would have swapped out, but we decide to just eat as was. \nThe duck hash was the real standout. Great flavor and a ton of duck. In the end we ended up splitting our dishes as they were the perfect combination together.  A little duck over the hollandaise was delightful as was mixing in with the hash. We are definitely getting this combo again and just splitting from beginning. Only criticism of hash is that they need to give you two eggs.  One is not enough and leaves the hash dry in the end. \nOf course we so wanted the basket of made to order donuts but will have to save for next trip....which may be next Saturday or even tomorrow night!", "author": "Jonathan H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-11", "description": "I had brunch on Sunday, and although the staff was friendly and attentive, the food left something to be desired.
