Food here is very fresh and delicious. they have a nice selection of sushi/rolls/sashimi even for the lunch special.

They deliver to almost anywhere and the dine in isn't bad either.\n\nThe food display is top notch....i mean it. Half the time you just want to stare at the food but once you dig in omg. The rice holds well, the fish is fresh,  the smoked eel is the best part to me.....try dissolving the wasabi in the soy sauce and dipping the roll in there. Yum!!\n\nTreat theses guys well and you'll reap the rewards in the long run.\n\n*cash and credit*", "author": "Quincy T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-09", "description": "Great atmosphere and service.

The kind at which no Japanese are likely employed. Nonetheless, I was served a most delightful sashimi platter. The presentation alone was exquisite. I'm gona have to dip back in next week and remember to snap it before it disappears into my belly. \n\nSweet sight aside, the prices make it even sweeter. Higher than average places of this category but they really hit the mark with quality and quantity. And I haven't before seen a standard regular sashimi plate with the variety of fishes they laid on. 3 each of tuna, salmon, whitefish, white tuna (seared outer edges, oh my) and 2 pieces of an avocado fish cucumber wrap thing that was a highlight in itself. \n\nAlso had a couple of squid sushi \u00e0 la carte. So glad I did. They go beyond the juicy squid slice slapped on a ball of rice, sneaking a shiso leaf in between and topping it all with ikura to make like eyes on a fish. As adorable as delicious. \n\nI walked out stuffed but already mental-scanning my schedule for a return visit. Maybe to try something else on the menu but...more likely to order exactly what I just demolished.

But unfortunately, will not be going back:\n\nI've been there twice- the first time the sushi tasted off (not fresh) and then last night, I found two hairs in my tuna roll. \nWould not advise.", "author": "Shannon G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-24", "description": "Since I am a pretty, pretty princess, I ordered the Princess Roll. \n\nSushi purists, beware. This isn't the type of sushi experience where you are savoring the beautiful simplicity of the fish. This is a spicy, crunchy tuna roll with eel, tuna, salmon, and avocado on top. But it tastes GOOD. \n\nIn fact, everything I've had here tastes good. The gyoza, the tuna dumpings, the Sunny Roll, the Fantastic Roll...I have yet to be disappointed.\n\nKyoto is not spectacularly decorated, and although that doesn't matter much to me, they seem to do a lot of takeout/delivery business as a result. Overall, I must admit that I prefer Ki Sushi across the street, especially aesthetically; it is far more conducive to a date.* However, this place is an excellent option when there is a line out the door at KI, as the fish is fresh, and they have more than a few interesting combination rolls.\n\nAnd it's cheaper. Which matters if you're, you know, me.\n__________\n\n*I hate to mention it, but our waiter suffered from a case of body odor that was impossible to ignore. My date probably chalked it up to my usual stank, but I can imagine how it could ruin a date for a man with generally good hygiene.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-21", "description": "Got delivery through seamless. My fault for getting non-sushi items from a sushi place, I guess, but the food was pretty awful. Mixed tempura, salmon, chicken entrees. I'm struggling to not puke right now. Also, each dish was about $6 more than it should've been. We thought the high prices meant quality! We're idiots.

I wish for the price the portions were larger but it isn't a huge deal. Also if they delivered to my area that would be swell!

Our waiter was very nice and showed my husband how to open up a bottle of Japanese soda.  There was a particular way to open the bottle and our waiter was gracious enough to show my husband how to open it.  I've had Japanese soda before, but I was not particularly fond of the one they offered at the restaurant.  None the less, my husband loved it!\n\nWhen it was time to order, we ordered edamame as an appetizer, the teriyaki chicken box for my husband, and I ordered two rainbow sushi rolls.  The edamame was fresh and nicely salted; my husband's chicken teriyaki box came with a lot of food.  Besides his chicken teriyaki, it came with a side of edamame, a small ear of corn, six pieces of California roll, two little egg rolls, four pieces of shumai, miso soup, and a salad.  Since my husband is allergic to shellfish, I had extra food to eat in addition to my rainbow rolls, which by the way were delicious!!!!\n\nAfterwards we ordered dessert.....and yes, I still had room to eat.  Hubby had the tempura ice cream which he loved, and I had red bean mochi....I love mochi!!!\n\nI am always satisfied with the food from Kyoto Sushi!!!
