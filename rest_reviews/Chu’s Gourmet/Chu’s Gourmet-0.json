It was always above decent Chinese takeout. Now, I will never go back.  I ordered my food and luckily I checked it and pointed out it was wrong. She rolls her eyes, says something in Chinese to the cook and they re do it. For the record, they were dead. Nobody in there at all. Redoing a customers food that you messed up doesn't warrant what happened next.  I was very reluctant about the meal after this. I get home and open it up, had a few bites. I sift thru it carefully...and carefully I find a 1 inch black hair.  Keep sifting, another and another.  Nah, I'm good.  Good luck if you decide to gamble on chewing on some greasy Chinese cooks pubs.", "author": "Pat C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-28", "description": "A star rating.

As I made several more trip to this place, my desire for food here dropped off exponentially. The noodles are just huge grease balls and the general tso's is mostly just breading. Some of the times, the chicken is over fried where it's a solid rock. I have also been very gassy after eating from this place.

Decided I wanted Chinese for lunch since I hadn't had breakfast this morning. Order for a co worker \u0026 myself. Once my food had Arrived I instantly saw that they had forgotten the chicken that went with my steamed broccoli \u0026 garlic sauce. They delivered my wings 20 minutes later after that rude lady kept hanging up on me as I tried to explain that they had forgotten the chicken. 15 minutes after I dealt with my last customer it's time to indulge in what I'd assume great Chinese American cuisine. Nope ! That doesn't happen. As I open up the steamed box of chicken I enjoy a piece. As I lift for my second piece of chicken long behold there's a roach laying dead under the drum of El Pollo - The end!

They deliver consistently fast, steaming hot food. They gotten to Dumbo in under 15 minutes. It's amazing. The food is well packaged. \nMy faves: bourbon chicken, generals tsos (it's tender real chunks of chicken fried and seasoned well), green beans and beef. \nSkip: the dumplings are a little too doughy and don't taste handmade.", "author": "Larry L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-19", "description": "From the outside, you would assume this place to be the usual mom-and-pop Chinese take-out.  However, it's larger than most take-outs.  Actually, this place is more like a restaurant because they have lots of seats along with restrooms.  No waiter service, though.  \n\nAs for food, they offer the usual dishes with rice, noodles or soups.  The lunch crowd is huge, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a few minutes to order.  They have a decent lunch and dinner menu with very reasonable pricing.  My recommendations would be the beef chow fun, wonton soup and fried chicken with rice.", "author": "John S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-05", "description": "Beware the dumplings. \n\nNot because they are bad, I actually found them to be quite delicious.* But I bit into one and shot porky juices across the room onto my girlfriend's belongings. She was irate and repeatedly accused me of biting with my mouth open** right up until the point when she did the same thing.\n\nSo I think the dumplings are packed a bit too tight.\n\nOther than that, Chu's Gourmet is exactly what I expected. It's Americanized Chinese, and they deliver hot and quick. The sort of spot that serves better than decent General Tso's Chicken, and Sesame Chicken that is exactly the same dish with a few sesame seeds sprinkled on top. \n\nIt's cheap ($6.50 all day for a dish with rice), and it satisfies a craving.\n_______________\n\n*About as good as they get outside the little dumpling houses that specialize. The skin could be a bit thinner and less doughy. \n**Please explain to me how to bite with your mouth closed.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-04", "description": "Order the salt and pepper poke chop, kind of salty.

I've had some very fine food in my life as well so, my standards for decent food aren't skewed because I'm poor.\n\nI read another review that said it wasn't very inviting inside, and I disagree- its actually very spacious inside, its quiet and there is no tv playing, which pleases me personally very much and is something I really take note of. It seems a lot of people get take out here, and I'm not surprised because this is Brooklyn heights, so I have the whole place to myself.\n\nThe food was prepared very quickly, so much so that I was at first skeptical of its quality, but digging in, its really alright, I've had much worse and would be very pleased to have a place like this in my area. I got the kung par chicken, which I get often, and its definitely on and above the acceptable range. The nuts taste cooked, or something, which is really the characterizing feature of the dish, I think. Good portion as well.\n\nThey seems to speak English fine as well.", "author": "Max F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-27", "description": "This is the one thing I really miss about living in the UES? Having multiple options for good, quality Chinese food delivered right to my doorstop.

When the food gets here the food has the very things I DID NOT ASK FOR. I call them back and the lady tells me \"it was a special order. Sorry.\" And hangs up. I came to the restaurant personally and brought the food with me to show them and tell them I found it disrespectful what they did.. Now the tell me being that it was a special order I had to pay them $2.00 for vegetables I didn't want added. None of that was stated on the menu nor the site. Then they proceed to make me feel like I don't matter by telling me the will remake it but in future not to order there again???? It is safe to say I will not order again.

I waited patiently on line for a few minutes, placed my order (vegetable fried rice with chicken and broccoli), and stepped to the side. Ten minutes passed and my meal wasn't prepared. The employee forgot and did not realize that I wasn't taken care of until she saw me still standing there. My meal came to a grand total of $6.80 and at least included a can of soda since the lunch specials start at $6.25. The food was pretty okay with me. The place was clean and busy during lunch time because of its proximity to the courthouses in downtown Brooklyn. I think the customer service could use a little improvement. In fact, there was a verbal disagreement between a customer who had the same experience and an employee.

After living on the UES for 3 years I was ready to commit myself. I was tired of the noise, the crowds, and the lousy food. When I'm depressed I like to lock myself inside put on sweats, watch bad movies and order Chinese. For this reason, Chinese food is important to my life. When I'm craving Orange Chicken, it needs to be authentic and scrumptious, and like the UES most things appear more authentic than they actually are. I literally have tried every Chinese food delivery on the Upper East Side, most of them were greasy, seriously lacking the sodium my PMS craved, and quite frankly, I usually felt like I was eating mystery meat. Ok, they weren't all this bad, but let's just say there were more bad than good.\n  \nWe finally moved to the DUMBO part of Brooklyn Heights and discovered Chu's. Food arrived within 10 mins. after I hung up the phone-no joke. The chef must've been throwing my order into the pan as they were taking my order b/c it came that fast!  As I bit into my Kung Pao, I could see the confetti being poured from the ceiling of my mind as the party in my mouth got started. Yes! I was this happy! Like a long lost dog being reunited with his bone-I was so happy to have great Cantonese back in my life. Hey, when you've had Authentic Americanized Chinese food in San Francisco, your palette too will become this spoiled. Eat at Chu's if you're in Brooklyn, if not, try Wa Jeal, on the PooES. I am now a devotee to Chu's. Are you there Chu?
