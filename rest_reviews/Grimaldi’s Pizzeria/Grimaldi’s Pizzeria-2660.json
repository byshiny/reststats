My friends and I waited about 45 minutes (which I hear is actually quick for this place), and got a pepperoni, sausage and onion pizza. The food was delicious, and reasonably priced. \n\nI didn't understand how the doorman was choosing people to enter though. It kind of felt like a club. Several groups of four got in before my group of three.

Had my 2nd visit to Grimaldi's with my roommates + roommate's parents. \n\nHeaded on a gorgeous Spring night by walking across the Brooklyn Bridge from Chinatown (~40 minutes). Got in an extremely long line at 8pm, and were seated in an hour at 9pm. Mind you, our party was 7 people so that wasn't bad at all. \n\nOur stomachs and eyes were hungry...I mean really hungry. Every time we inched ourselves a little bit closer to the door, we would breathe in the smell of Grimaldi's pizza goodness. Almost there.\n\nWe sat down finally. Immediately asked the waiter if he was Italian, and he got our hopes down by saying he was Polish. :( Who cares. We were still f-ing hungry. Ordered 2 margarita pizzas (basil + mozarella), 1 veggie (tomatoes, onions, mushrooms), and 1 meat (ham, sausage). Plus two humungo \"jars\" of wine. Classy, just the way we like it. The margarita pizzas were awesome. But, it would be a dream if we could get all toppings onto one pizza (of only they weren't $3+ per topping!) \n\nI left so stuffed, naturally, I had to unbotton the top button of my jeans. We had tons of leftovers to bring back with us. Ahh, maybe I shouldn't have eaten that fast.

After a while I thought it was just trash talk.  Then I decided to give Grimaldi's a try. Man, did I eat crow! It is the best pizza I have ever had.  I would seriously give up my first born for some of that pie!  Or at the least send them on a flight to Russia!\n\nI waited two hours in line to enter a ridiculously packed house with so many people elbow to elbow that I could've eaten a slice off the neighboring table.  We ordered the simplest pizza possible, the margherita with just mozzarella and basil. The crust was perfectly thin and sauce delicious, but not overpowering.  I missed my flight out of town b/c of this pizza and I would do it again!\n\nNow my next question for you New Yorkers - What the heck is a Pizza Hut doing in the middle of Manhattan?!?! And why are people in there!?!? I hope for reputation's sake that the people I saw in there were tourists from Europe (judging by the Daisy Dukes on some of those guys, I think they were, but then again...) I can't even understand why NYorkers would eat in California Pizza Kitchen!  All we have to show is putting some duck or BBQ sauce on the pizza. Fuhgettaboutit! WTF!\n\nAll the girlfriend and I could think about that whole week was that dang pizza.  Now when people in LA tell me they have found the best pizza place, I answer with the only thing that makes sense - Shuddup!\n\nBest Thing -  pizza", "author": "Hion L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-03", "description": "Over rated pizza!

I caught the subway downtown so I could walk the Brooklyn Bridge. I got to Brooklyn about 15 minutes prior to Grimaldi's opening and there was already a line of about 8 people (and did I mention that a bus tour also pulled up and was seated before us). I had read so much hype about this place, I thought I have to try it. Little did I realize that I would have to buy an entire pizza for myself as they don't sell by the slice. \n\nDidn't bother waiting for a table inside, despite the heat. I decided to take my pizza and sit near the waterfront. As I opened the white package I could tell that this was going to be a great pizza - fresh buffalo mozzarella, basil, pepperoni. My first bite of pizza put me in pepperoni pizza heaven! yum, Yum, YUM!!! The sauce was perfection, there was just the perfect amount of cheese and pepperoni. \n\nNeedless to say I wasn't able to finish an entire pizza on my own, so I shared it with two NYPD officers, who were coincidentally sitting in their car with the a/c on and finishing their own pizza. I then walked back over the bridge with a smile on my face. . . ahhhh good pizza!", "author": "D S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-14", "description": "Never get the black olives.

So far, several friends are joining me for some of these, and this one was no exception.  I had to log in a 6-mile walk, so I organized a group to start in Times Square, walk down the west side Greenway, then over the Brooklyn Bridge and down to the waterfront.  We ended 6.3 miles on line at Grimaldi's....\n\nWe figured we earned the pizza.  And after hearing so much over the years about how great it was, and seeing the lines, we figured we were in for pizza heaven.\n\nWas this the best pizza I've ever had?  Far from it.  Not to say it was bad, but it was rather bland and not terribly memorable.  The waiter was VERY memorable - he was adorable and charming and flirted shamelessly, and was definitely the best part of the meal (along with sitting down, after 6.3 miles and an hour's wait).  \n\nMy best pizza ever was Vinnie's on the West Side, a lovely hole-in-the-wall institution that unfortunately no longer exists..... *sob*\n\nIf you don't have to wait long for it, this might be worthwhile, but I don't think I'll be back.", "author": "Philine V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-14", "description": "Genuinely good pizza but not worth the wait.
