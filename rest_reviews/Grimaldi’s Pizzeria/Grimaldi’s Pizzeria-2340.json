First of all, maybe it's my fault, but I had it really hyped up in my head before I had even arrived.  That day, my wife and I decided to take the 6 train to city hall and walk across the bridge.  By the time I got there, I was famished, but then I saw the line.  It was long, but this is New York.  \n\nOnce we got inside, we were seated in a cramped table in very close quarters.  Then it took quite a while for us to be approached by our server.  In fact, we had to flag one down.  If we didn't , who knows how long it would have been.  We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom, two waters, and a root beer for my wife.  The pizza took a long time to come out.  Usually these thin crust, coal or brick oven places cook pizzas at a very high temperature, so a pizza can cook in 5 min or so, but it seemed to take about 20 mins or so for our pizza to come.  It did come out hot and fresh though.  Definitely no complaints on freshness. \n\nThe pizza......it was big enough for two to eat, and take home a couple of slices.  It looked like it was cooked nicely from the top, just the right amount of toppings, not skimpy at all.  There were a few crust bubbles that should have been popped during cooking, that bubbled up and turned black, but I could live with those.  The pepperoni was excellent, maybe the best I've ever had.  At first, I thought they were too small, as I typically prefer the larger ones, but once I tasted them, they were amazing!  And nice thick pieces too.  The cheese was great, the mushrooms fresh.  My other complaint was that the crust was wet at the bottom.  Not from undercooking or being raw, but from condensation.  I think that means that they need to put some cornmeal underneath it to get a little airflow under it, but maybe not..I'm not a pizza cooking expert, just a pizza eating expert.  Lastly the sauce. It was rich, flavorful, and on the sweeter side.  it was awesome sauce.\n\nMy wife didn't like her root beer, so I had a sip, and it was overly sweet for my tastes as well.  But not Grimaldis fault.  They didn't brew it.  \n\nThe water, was water.  lol.\n\nOverall, I give three stars because the soggy crust was a big disappointment, the line was a little annoying, but not the worst, and the service was non existent.  \n\nThe price wasn't bad either.  Our bill was just over $20.\n\nWould I go again? Probably not, but maybe.  I would prefer to keep moving forward on my search for the best pizza in NYC because there are infinite pizza shops in this city, and when you find something you love, you'll know it.\n\nSome other pizza places that I recommend are Patsy's in East Harlem, Europan because I love the super crispy crust, but my favorite was Eataly.  The pizza was wood or coal fired, but the best part was the cheese on the 4 cheese pizza.  It was the richest, creamiest cheese that I've ever had.  I love cheese my whole life, and I had no ideal that cheese even existed like the 4 cheese pizza at Eataly.  That place is by the Flatiron building.

We love coming to the Brooklyn Bridge park and we always saw the line for Grimaldi's.

I'm a New Yorker and had never tried Grimaldi's so it was now or never.  \n\nWell, the wait was about an hour and when we finally got the pizza on the table (a sausage and mushroom pie), I couldn't believe this was what we waited for and paid $16 for!  I couldn't even find the mushrooms in the pie.  I had to look for them.  The sausage was flavorless as was the cheese.  Luckily, they had some hot pepper flakes and Italian seasoning on the table to give it some flavor.  It was also extra thin so not much to bite into.  \n\nI'm really not sure what all the hype is about.  Can someone educate me?  I just made myself a frozen pizza that I added tons of onions, peppers, pepperoni, cheese and basil to and it's 10 times better and more flavorful.

Best pizza I've ever had. \n\nThe Bf and I walked the Brooklyn Bridge quite early, and by the time we made our way to Grimaldi's, it wasn't open just yet. It had about half an hour to go, so we decided to roam around brooklyn for a bit. When we returned, there was a ginormous line! Luckily time passed by pretty quick. We got a mushroom and garlic pizza, with half pepperoni for the carnivore. The thin, crunchy crust was perfect. The mozzerela cheese was so fresh.

I've tried other pizzerias in NYC, but none have compared to Grimadi's yet.  \n\nThe crust is perfectly thin: not chewy but not like a cracker, either.  It achieves the perfect balance, probably due to the old school coal brick oven.  How can pizza be made in anything else?  The cheese, sauce, pepperoni, and sausage tasted so fresh that I find it difficult eating anything with any of those ingredients now because they feel like bad cover versions compared to the freshness at Grimaldi's.", "author": "Frank M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-10", "description": "Before you question my taste and opinion for pizza, I would like to inform you of where I have been. Bleecker St. Pizza, Johns Pizzeria, Grimaldi's, Ray's and I am 240lbs. so lets just say I know how to eat lol. I want to give this review without being too negative so I will be as nice as I can and say I was disappointed. I have eaten at another Grimaldis in Las Vegas, was amazed how awesome their pizza was, and could not wait to go to the original. I came on a Tuesday night, there was no line, and we were seated fast. The environment was cool and old school but I thought it was weird when I heard the accent of the workers and did not recognize the language as being Italian but more like Russian. \n\nAnyways, we ordered a pizza with pepperoni and enjoyed it but it was not awesome or wonderful or anything special. Disappointed yes, I wanted to love it, I mean I watched the food wars show and was ecstatic when Grimaldis won over Johns so believe me I was going into this experience ready for the best pizza ever. To find out, I ran into a couple of New Yorkers through out the city like at the Yankee game, Katz's deli and NYU and everyone of them spoke about Grimaldi's being a tourist trap and I happen to believe they were right. Again, the pizza was good but nothing great. Should you try it, yes, find out for yourself and then you can have an opinion. It is not horrible it is good but I believe there are better.\n\nI ran into one of the waiters outside, I asked him where he was from, he said POLAND and that all the workers were from POLAND. Poland and pizza is not what comes to mind when thinking of pizza. Personally, I would do Johns Pizzeria", "author": "Nathan P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-10", "description": "What is Lindsay K smoking?  WOW.  She must be related to the owners of Lomardi's!\n\nThis place is amazing and is by far the BEST Pizza in New York.  Lombardi's is good but Grimaldi's is out of this world.\n\nEverything about the pizza is absolutley fresh which means it is as tastey as it can possibly be!  They make the pies perfect with fresh mozzarella laid down first, then toppings, then light on the sauce (aka perfect) and then with some oil on top before they slide it into the brick coal oven.\n\nIt is just so amazing.  Yes there is a wait to get into this place.  We waited on line for about 1 hour.  The wait is the only down side but the cost benefit ratio is waaaaaayyyy too high to let a little standing around ruin your day.\n\nThere isn't anything more that I can add that hasn't been said. If you are visiting NYC and you want amazing pizza (not to mention amazing views of Manhattan) this is the place!\n\nThey also recently opened a location in Manhattan on 20th and 6th if you want to check that out.", "author": "Andrew S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-19", "description": "Best PIZZA in NYC! and that's saying a lot because there so great places to good pizza in the city.

After searching for about 15 minutes for parking, we stood in a short line for about 10 minutes or so.\nWe finally were seated by this older gentleman that must either be the manager or the owner. Everything inside is so cramped, we ordered a small pie, my girlfriend tried ordering wine and the bad news is for those that drink, they don't sell alcohol, maybe this is a temporary or permanent thing.\nAfter waiting for about 15 minutes for the pie, we finally got to taste what the big deal is about, well it was an ok pie, after a few minutes the pies tend to turn sort of soggy, at least ours did, we noticed that when it was brought it was a bit wet, no it wasn't the sauce, a small puddle formed in the center of the pie.\nThe only crispy part about our pie was the small burnt crust, the dough had this refrigerated taste to it, we ordered extra basil and the pie only had 5 crumbled pieces on top. We left 1 piece of the 6 slices, not saying it was the worst pizza in the world, but it wasn't the best either.\nFrom the time you're seated to the time you're given the check, there's this feeling from the and I'm assuming managing staff (the older gentleman seating everyone and another short heavy set mobster looking guy) as if they're rushing you, it just feels as if someone is going to tell you \"hurry up and eat\" \nI once thought that Grimaldi's was a one restaurant deal, there's a poster at the front door with over 30 locations in certain states, makes me just think that this place is on it's way up to becoming the next Pizza Hut.\nOverall I'm not saying this is the worst place ever, but maybe they were having a bad night, but you know what they say it's the first impression that counts.\nThis place has a lot of tourist pouring in, probably brought there by guide books, they probably think this is the best in NYC, is waiting in line as if it's for a FEMA help location worth it? NOOOO, go elsewhere if the line is that long.\n\nP.S.
