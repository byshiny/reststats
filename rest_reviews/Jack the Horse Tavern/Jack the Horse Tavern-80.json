I credit the cheesees they use: smoked Gouda \u0026 Fontina.  With the tiny crust on top, this made mac \u0026 cheese a true gourmet experience.\n\nI had the mussels with toasts and fries, and I loved it.  My boyfriend had the special of the day: fish.  I can see how disappointed he was at the portion, but the fish was also cooked to perfection.  Why must good things come in tiny portions?

The side of bacon was a heaping mound of good bacon, yes! The only was fluffy and flavorful and the cheddar grits wee very well seasoned.

My only personal \"negative\" was that they no longer offer regular Eggs Benedict. I'm sure I have eaten that at JTH previously. My wife, however, loves the version with oysters. \n\nThe French toast our friends had and the omelet I had were all delicious, as were the brunch cocktails and coffee. \n\nThe only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the music is a little too loud and that, combined with the proximity of the tables, makes it difficult to have much conversation.", "author": "Rich M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "We were in town for business and used yelp to look for fine dinning.

Bad waitress and that kills the entire experience...\n\nBloody Mary was not impressive either. No drink specials -- $9 for a mimosa and $10 for a classic bloody. \n\nOn a good note, they only use organic eggs. I was hoping to try an omelet but the only come \"standard\". So paying to add a protein was not an option. Wth? I'm PAYING. But anyway, no food for me and I will take my money and appetite elsewhere. Minus the $10 wasted on the Bloody Mary. \n\nSo -- 2 stars because the hostess was quite pleasant. Very pleased with her energy. She should pass some along to the slow, terrible waitress.", "author": "D.

Good date spot, comfy d\u00e9cor, slightly dim for dinner but not too dark that you can't see your food. I like that it doesn't get too crowded or loud on a Friday night with single young things filling up the bar area, hitting on each other. \n\nFood was good, but not exciting. Slightly creative, but didn't hit the target. We ordered:\nMac n Cheese: one of the better one I've had. Not too thick with a nice crust.\nBurger: well seasoned and juicy. \nMixed Herb Polenta: nicely browned n crispy slab of polenta with a creamy mushroom sauce. It was good, but the high acidity of the mushroom keeps throwing me off. Just a tad too sour.\nScallops: simple caramelized scallops. I didn't care too much for the corn medley it came with- tasted more like canned corn instead of fresh corn from the cob, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nThis is not a must-return spot for me for dinner, but I would like to try the brunch here- heard it's quite delicious.", "author": "Huong V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-12", "description": "We have been to this place at least 8 times in 3 years (we live in the neighborhood), and used to like it a lot - but in our opinion it has gone downhill... the last two visits have been mediocre to low quality.  We don't understand why.  My wife ordered the short rib - whatever they served was not a short rib, we know what a short rib looks like and tastes like and this wasn't it- and it was burnt and tough.  We also got the hangar steak - which was overly-seasoned with something (soy sauce or teriyaki, don't know) and didn't taste fresh.  No refills on water and no bread basket brought to the table.  The other dish (roasted chicken) was good and my drink was good.  For these prices, this shouldn't happen.

Fortunately we arrived around 7, early for the dinner rush. \n\nOur waiter seemed enthusiastic but a little too much as he kept trying to sell us the higher priced meaty entr\u00e9es, the steak and prime rib. \n\nWe ordered the mac n' cheese and brussel sprouts to start. Both were good. \n\nI had the burger with caramelized bourbon onions. It was great! Just the right amount of meat to bun. The bun itself was more like ciabatta than a soft burger bun. But it wasn't too big. The meat itself was a satisfying medium rare. It came with just the right amount of fries which were crisped to perfection. \n\nMy husband had the squash risotto. He was meh about it, not ecstatic, especially since it was $20+\n\nI had a sidecar cocktail which was yummy. Husband had the Buffalo Rifle. Also good. \n\nWe finished off with a trio of their gelato. Baby scoops of blueberry, hazelnut, dark chocolate. Again, a perfect portion to end the dinner on a sweet note.", "author": "Nancy C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-13", "description": "Happy hour at Jack the Horse is a great deal, so I've been back several times.

Started with Polenta, egg and tomato starter which was fantastic, highlight of the meal.  Then a rich mac-n-cheese with complex, pungent chesses, no velveeta there, tho a little over-salted.  Finally a salmon special with some mexican flavours, ok, but slightly dry and certainly not the medium-rare we asked for.  \n\nThe service was poor.  I asked for a corner table - and they confirmed they had it covered when they called to confirm the booking earlier in the day.  We arrived and were shown a table in the middle of the room with waiters brushing by.  The woman on the door half-apologized, then blamed the head waiter and said it was his fault for giving the table away, and he'd be over to apologize/explain.

On Tuesday, July 26, I ordered duck and by the time it arrived at my table, it was just room temperature. No big deal. I'm sure coordinating a busy kitchen isn't easy. To my surprise, however, I lost my appetite after eating just a third of my meal. (Apparently, room temperature duck tastes a little metallic.)\n\nI mentioned this to my waiter and he responded as you'd expect, with a genuine interest in making things right. That was totally sufficient to me. I didn't want anything.\n\nAs any good waiter would do, he went and reported the problem to his manager. I appreciated the gesture sincerely, but still, I didn't want anything. Surprisingly, this is where things went bad. The manager began gesturing in a way that it was clear she was dismissing my feedback and his effort to make things right! He turned bright red, clearly embarrassed by her response.\n\nThere are so many good options in Brooklyn Heights.

Ok fine, snicker a little at the name (It's named after the family's old vacation spot in Minnesota, called Jack the Horse Lake), and be completely blown away by the food. Tucked away in a quiet Brooklyn Heights neighborhood, you'd never think there would be a pristine DIAMOND here. Absolutely loved it. I came here with a group of 8 and ordered almost everything on the menu. Here are the top choices:\n\nAppetizers:\nMacaroni \u0026 Cheese: a lovely mix of fontina and smoked gouda \nTomato Polenta with Slow Cooked Egg: Crispy, savory, and unforgettable\n\nEntrees:\nGrilled Pork Chop: pretty unfackingbelievable\nPan Roasted Diver Scallops: gulping down 6 scallops in less than 2 minutes seemed to go too fast\n\nPersonally, the only thing I didn't love was the short rib special. Slightly oversalted. But everything else TO DIE FOR! Service is beyond excellent and every single dish was consistently just as good as the next.
