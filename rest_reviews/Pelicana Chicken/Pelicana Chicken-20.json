Okay I thought... finally something different and not out of my comfort zone. I placed my order by phone as the young lady was very nice and soft spoken. She told me it would be about 25 minutes before it was ready for pickup. I ordered two boxes of boneless chicken with spicy barbecue sauce and the other plain crispy with sauce on the side. I drove around a bit to kill some time. As soon as I arrived I was greeted right away and the inside had a welcoming chill vibe to it. Kinda like a very small calmer Buffalo Wild Wings but Asian style. Cool right. I paid for my food and asked to use the bathroom which by the way had a beautiful decor that was exceptionally clean. I then grabbed my food and left. As soon as I got to the car I really wanted to taste it to see how good it was. That is when things went left....\n\nSo, the chicken had dark meat and mostly batter. The so called spicy barbecue was not spicy at all it was sweet. Not good at all. I am convinced that it may not even be chicken. You can try it for yourself because maybe it was a late bad day when I went. I really had high hopes overall but I may give it another go one day...Maybe.", "author": "Serina J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-24", "description": "This was my first time ordering from and trying this restaurant out. My wife and I were very pleased with the service and the food. The chicken was moist and tender. The avocado salad was excellent.

They didn't taste baked at all. More like fried with no flour . The garlic wings were not good at all. Way to sweet. The spicy bbq was better but not by much. They both had to much sauce. It was like having sauce with wings not wings with sauce . We will go back but just not get the wings . Maybe the sandwich instead. I will give them one more chance.", "author": "Dia A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-19", "description": "Candelight can feel obnoxious when a place isn't that well-run. Among other things, I would have liked more clarity on the fact that one of the top-listed items, the half chicken, wasn't available. But even after I decided that Pelicana was a glammed-up BK bar in restaurant clothes, the wings quieted my angst. I got the sweet-and-spicy version, medium level.", "author": "Josh B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-18", "description": "Lovely, trendy spot. Good location.

Now I won't have to travel all the way to the city for my cravings! Everything was so good and super easy to share amongst group of friends. All the staff here were super attentive and friendly. I really appreciate that given that they were busy at times. (nothing ruins a good meal like a bad attitude)\nThey have multiple TV's with different games so it's perfect for the sports fanatic. If you're like me, who only watches sports cus of their boyfriend, they also play a great mix of music. \nGood food + drinks + great ambiance.

The chicken, as moist and juicy as it is, is covered in so much batter, as light and flaky as it is, that our $27 \"whole chicken\" just wasn't filling, definitely not enough to satisfy two adults, or perhaps we were just expecting more food, what we received wasn't worth the price... To be fair, my expectations of portions \u0026 prices \u0026 quantity \u0026 quality are compared to my experiences with other Korean fried chicken ioints (KyoDong, KyoChon, BonChon, TurnTable, Unidentified Flying Chickens, etc) rather than KFC or Popeye's...", "author": "David L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-08", "description": "I've been searching and searching for Korean fried chicken as good as I had in Korea, and FINALLY I've found it.\n\nWings are cooked perfectly. Meaty and juicy.\n\nWe had crispy fried plain and crispy fried with the level 3 spicy sauce.\n\nFry batter is super crunchy and not to oily.\n\nSpicy sauce was radioactive. So hot I got the hiccups.

I thought this was very rude because I was only ten minutes early and I am a paying customer so they should at least let me sit down while they fully open.
