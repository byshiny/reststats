The d\u00e9cor and service were outstanding and they also have an outdoor dining area towards the back of the restaurant. There's also a full bar right near the front entrance. For a restaurant with a full bar, you would think they'd accept credit cards, but WOMP! CASH ONLY. \n\nThe food is mediocre. The flavor lacked authenticity and should not be labeled as \"THAI FOOD.\"\n \nI had the pad thai which tasted like it was drowned in tamarind and fish sauce. My boyfriend had the steak which was on their special menu and it tasted just like the pad thai- drowned with tamarind and fish sauce. Not only that, the food were all very salty. After my experience with food in New York, I believe California is the one of the few states in the nation that has the best cuisine of EVERYTHING!!!", "author": "Charisma C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-04", "description": "I treated a friend (who recently graduated college) to this place last night .\n\nAtmosphere:  Nice and modern decor, lighting quite dim.  Indoors is pretty noisy, the outdoor garden is quite nice.  \n\nService:  Abrupt and quick, like most Thai restaurants I've been to.  Our appetizers and food came in maybe less than 20 minutes.\n\nFood:  Insanely good.\n\nFor starters, my friend and I had shrimp spring rolls, and a small plate of calamari.  Everything was incredibly fresh and piping hot, we had to blow on the food before putting it in our mouths.  \n\nFor entrees, I had the spicy noodle with shrimp, while my friend had one of the green curry dishes.  The dish has very strong garlic and fennel flavors, but it wasn't what I would define as \"spicy\".  That said, it was still very delicious and filling. \n\nDrinks:  We both had Thai iced teas, which was a creamy, sweet and refreshing treat on such an awful summer day.\n\nGrand total for both appetizers, entrees and beverages + tax = grand total of $36.90.  I could *not* believe it. \n\nThe only downside to this place, is that it's cash only. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place for meeting friends, or going on a date.", "author": "Kanika H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-27", "description": "I love ordering from here and going out to eat! The only complaints that I have are 1)The music is WAYY too loud.

I'm glad they're not afraid to make the food spicy, that was a plus.\n\nThe food lacks some depth though. I got Panang curry.

The place was full of people, good food, and cheer.  I arrived with a friend at around 9 and we were worried that we wouldn't be seated right away, however that was not an issue. We also had preference of whether we wanted to sit in or outside, it was a warm summer night so we chose to sit outside and I am glad we did.  On the way to our seats I noticed the open kitchen where you can see your food being prepared.  Our waitress was very attentive and even gave us ample time to catch up before ordering our food without pressuring us.  I ended up ordering the veggie pad Thai w/o eggs and my friend ordered the spicy noodles.  The food was fresh and tasty, and came in a reasonable time.  The portions are huge and I couldn't finish everything on my plate but I def. took the rest home and I only ended up spending $13 including tip! Overall, the ambience is chill, it's the perfect place for a first date, and I will be returning!", "author": "Shiloh A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-20", "description": "Yes!\nTasty thai food, nice atmosphere, very healthy portions, reasonably priced.\nDefinitely going back.", "author": "Gabor C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-24", "description": "In our final meal for our stay in downtown Brooklyn we went to Joya for lunch. We hadn't tried an Asian restaurant in the area and went with the Yelp recommendations.\n\nWe got there about noon and we were the first people there. When we walked in, the music was blasting out fairly loud. We had to search for a spot that wasn't that noisy. We had a fairly simple lunch, I had the Pad Thai with Shrimp (a lunch special) and my wife had the Pad See Ew (flat noodles with broccoli and a dark soy-like sauce) with tofu. Service was a bit spotty - there was only one waiter and he kept getting diverted with new customers coming in so we had some delays. It got better later in our meal.\n\nMy wife really liked the Pad See Ew - she said it was one of the best she's had in a long time. My Pad Thai did not come close to being good. It was overly sweet with a minuscule amount of shrimp. Both lunch meals were large portions. I left over half mine. I did taste my wife's meal and it was much better (and I ended up eating a decent portion of it).\n\nOn the upside, the lunch cost very little. I was surprised it was a cash only restaurant. I wish they had advertised that in the window. I didn't have that much cash with me so it was good that the meal was cheap.", "author": "Chris C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-31", "description": "I love Joya!

Don't get me wrong, she was super friendly and I'm sure she does her job well when she isn't under pressure. Let me break it down for you. A friend and I headed to Joya after an Ikea trip. We arrived at around 7:40ish pm on a Saturday and the place was popping. There was a 30 minute wait, so I left my name with the hostess and sat my happy butt down for the next 45 mins (I was really digging the food I was seeing..lol.) After the 46th minute, I went to the waitress and asked her about our table (we were pretty much the last ones standing at this point.) She apparently forgot to write my name down, but seated us moments after. Bless her heart...\n\nI had difficulty determining what i wanted to wanted to eat because I couldn't keep my eyes off of all the delicious dishes that were coming out the kitchen (that was conveniently located within the dining area.) We ordered the curry puff and thai spare ribs as an appetizer. The ribs were a little tough, but I still got down with them. The curry puff was AH-MAZING! For an entree I ordered the shrimp Pad See Yue. Mannnnnnnnnnnn, I was blown away by how delicious my dish was! \n\nCONCLUSION: Joya is delicious, it really is. The whole \"waiting game\" is a little frustrating, and be prepared to be on top of each other if you're sitting in the back of the dining area.", "author": "Lauren P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-31", "description": "Great thai food and service!

Nothing to rave about. Had the chicken/avacado summer roll (dry and tasteless), Thai ribs (also dry and tasteless ) and the only decent two meals: pineapple and spicy pork fried rice and veggie pad Thai. Also mediocre. We sat at the bar and it felt like the bartenders were watching us. Loud/younger crowd.  I could see it being great meet up for geoups, but personally not a fan.

When I got there  I headed to the desk to inform the staff that we would need a table for six so the owner who was on the phone stated that we could not be seated until our entire party was there, this is standard procedures for some  restaurants.So  the three  people of the party of six  proceded to the bar to buy  three drinks.  Which we did! About 5 mintues later  the other three show up so I kindly got up to inform the staff that the whole party was here and before I could say anything  the owner puts his finger up and says you dont have to come back just sit down until you are called then proceeds to get back on the phone. My friend says to me that was rude then the owner proceeds to say very rudely  \"I am the owner and I am not rude I am just busy, if you think I am rude there is the door.\" What!! Who does that to people who spends their money in your establishment. That is not how business is conducted. If he was so busy how was he able to respond being so mean. What owner has such behavior. Of course we left and spent our money wisely at a restaurant that has better customer service.I would not recommend  this place base on the attitude of the owner!
