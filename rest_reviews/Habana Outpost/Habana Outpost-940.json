Not only is it a very \"green\" place (the toilets run on rain water) but the food is exceptional. Never hesitate to get the side of corn because its a barnburner of a tastebud blast. The Chicken Diablo sandwich is a perfect partner to the corn with chipotle mayo and blackened chicken breast over a fire. Seating outside is comfy and often times they have movies or entertainment. The Price is right with bob barker for this place. a must try on a summer day. The mojito would even make the members of kiss say \"ALLLLRIIIIIIGHT\".", "author": "Lukas P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-18", "description": "I'm sorry but this place is overrated.  The line goes out the door just to order a drink and it feels sticky in there.  I get the vibe of being in college again ie. spilled drinks, overly crowded, pushing, young skinny jean * thick black glasses wearers, no seats available at the outside area.  It just seems elementary to me, be it the decor/design \u0026 the crowd that it attracts.  The crowd is a mix of emo, ghetto, hipster, skater, eco-friendly haven't showered in days hippies....its just all over the place.  On top of that when you get to the front of the line, your beer is clearly diluted and the food is subpar.  They have 2-3 sitting booths behind the bar and at the outside deck there are maybe 10 painted picnic tables with large umbrellas on each of them scattered around the gated outside area.  15 min in I had enough and finally ditched my party and headed to the next spot.  Def an acquired taste.", "author": "Toni T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-01", "description": "This place WAS great.  Then it became over run w rif-raf.  I too was shocked when they tried to charge $10/person (w a free $2 drink, ha), BUT I think it needed to be done.  I don't know how else they could  resolve the problem of SOOO much \"rif-raf\" spilling out onto the sidewalk/street.  It was obnoxious.  So although, i'm loath to wait in their long and really slow lines, I'll go there early in the day when it's not too crowded for the cheap beers and to sit outside (although we've only stopped by once this year so far.)", "author": "hazy l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-27", "description": "Seeing that I'm out there constantly trudging through these city streets looking to bring a little light to your lives (or at least some cool shit), I do occasionally run across pure awesomeness.  My dear dear friends, while I have neither the time nor desire to suss out whether or not the Habana Outpost is NY's first Eco-Eatery, as it claims, I can absolutely confirm that HO (apparently I haven't the time nor desire to type out whole restaurant names either) fits into the above-mentioned category of pure awesomeness.  Running off solar energy, having cups and cutlery made from biodegradable cornstarch, being adorned by bright murals and having a smoothie machine powered by either you or some kid on a bicycle (ATTN: child protective services) is only the tip of the compost pile, er, iceberg of HO's twice mentioned pure awesomeness.  There's also a big outdoor patio/cerveza garden that has a local artisan bazaar on the weekends and the joint doubles as a community event space hosting things like summer movie nights, art, and burlesque shows.  AND, they have local beers on tap for only $2.50!  Since it is technically a restaurant I should mention that the Cuban/pan-Latin food served here is great but it isn't super cheap ($7.75 chicken burrito).  That being said, the corn ($2) is so good I'd beat up the kid on the bicycle for it without thinking twice.", "author": "Broke-Ass Stuart S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-05-28", "description": "The Brooklyn offshot of Cafe Habana - this eco-friendly eatery is the perfect go-to location on a Sunny day. On the corner of Fulton and South Portland street in Brooklyn, it's an easy subway ride from practically any Manhattan location and boy is it worth it. Enclosed in a  playground-like open air corner, patrons pay and order inside and pick up their grilled corn, salads, quesadillas, and other delicious eats outside from the solar powered cooking truck where your name is called out through speakers when ready. A fountain, colorful benches and swings are scattered in the yard outside for you to hang out and leisurely eat your steaming corn (the same delicious one as the Nolita Cafe Habana location, but somehow better eaten under the sun) as music blares from the speakers outside. Smoothies are delicious, free, and made by the cutest boy, Tyler, who puts fresh fruit in a bike-powered blender and starts biking to blend your fresh smoothie together. The food itself is amazing, but it's fun, leisurely atmosphere and eco-friendly ways makes it even more ridiculous.", "author": "Chris L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-30", "description": "Came here a couple times with my fianc\u00e9e and friends...good place to chill in a trendy neighborhood...food is good get the corn it's awesome...drinks are a little overpriced but all in all I loved it.", "author": "Nick S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-06", "description": "love this place cute and fun, the food is great!!  must check it out!!! the one on prince in soho is open all year round! have fun!", "author": "Livzan M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-10", "description": "love this place! cheap beer good times!", "author": "ben o."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-16", "description": "Cuban sandwiches were so so good.

I dunno how that happens, but I swear it's true. I think I'm going to try to go here more often to benefit from the beauty by osmosis. I love the fact that they have so much eco-friendly technology: rainwater in the toilets, solar powered cell phone charging station, and I'm sure there's other stuff I don't know about it. What keeps that fifth star held back is the prices on the menu. The frozen margarita/mojito are about $8 and when I had them they weren't that strong. Also, what's up with the Mexican food at a place called Habana? My chicken burrito sin arroz actually turned out to be dryish (though well-seasoned) chicken breast with mixed field greens in a tortilla. I was looking forward to the onions, peppers, and beans so that was saddening. Despite the lackluster food, I just can't wean myself from this place, especially in the summer time. It feels like a backyard cookout with people whom you wish you shared genetic material.", "author": "Ava R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-02", "description": "Love this place! Food is good but you have to wait for a long time if its crowded and it's hard to heard your name called. Drinks were weak the last time I went, but had been strong previous time.
