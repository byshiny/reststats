Their Nutella Chai along with their ice cream rolls are a must try! I love the presence this shop brings to the neighborhood and I have to stop by here for a double espresso before work as it is conveniently located off exit 4 on the BQE.", "author": "Jia C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-13", "description": "My new favorite place for lunch. I was here the other day with a friend of mine, that lives in the neighborhood.  She knows all the hot spots. The staff seems very pleasant and welcoming. Of course I had to try their hand rolled ice cream the other day. The best ever!!!!

I can always get a seat here and post up with a couple cups of coffee and get some work done. So many coffeeshops in the area get overcrowded that having this as an option as well is great.", "author": "Luis G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-01", "description": "Best coffee in the neighborhood hands down with a friendly staff as well.

It's like candy in coffee form! So happy this place opened down the block from where I live - I love the warm lighting, relaxing music, fast wifi, and modern feel. And really....Nutella latte.
