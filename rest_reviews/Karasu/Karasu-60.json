It is a great spot for a date (if you are ok with the price tag) or for dinner with friends.  The staff is great as well. \n\nThe second thing to know is that the food is really tasty and the drinks are interesting an dwell prepared.  We loved the streak for two, and I highly recommend springing for that.  The only knock on this spot was that some of the appetizers weren't as good as the entrees, but the menu is focused and you really can't go wrong. \n\nIt is the back of Walters, which is a tasty restaurant in its own right.", "author": "Ian A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-20", "description": "This is my first Yelp review, and the only thing that motivated me to write it was an absolutely fantastic, personal and memorable experience at Karasu. So glad to have this gem of an addition to the Fort Greene foodscape. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I went there for a low key birthday dinner last Sunday and came away having had a terrific meal (the sashimi and dorade are to die for) and feeling the warm and fuzzies thanks to our lovely hostess Lauren, who brought out celebratory drinks of sake, dessert lit by a candle, and generally made us feel so special. \n\nThank you Lauren and Chef Peet - look forward to the next time!", "author": "Sruthi L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-13", "description": "I don't know how this has only gotten 4 reviews. It's a lovely spot - quiet, not crowded, easy to make a reservation, beautiful setting. \n\nFood menu is small but what they do have was delicious. We got the scallop sashimi, hibiki and the ribeye. The steak was delicious and wasn't heavy in the way it's done at a classic steakhouse.

It's right thru the hallway. It's a dimly lit brooding dining room with an intimate ambience.\n\nMe and 3 friends ordered 3 appetizers: the duck kara-age, age-dashi and the tsukune. It was a good amount for us and each of them were innovative interesting takes on traditional dishes.\n\nI then made the wise decision to order the tonkatsu. Oh man, it was stellar. I have been to Japan dozens of times and this was easily one of the best pork cutlets I have ever had. It was perfectly breaded and fried. Not too chewy, not too crunchy. When I bit into it, the cutlet was juicy and rich. Thankfully there was a lot of it and I was able to share the wealth with my friends.\n\nMy only problem was that the prices were a little exorbitant. I can find a slightly lower quality Japanes place which would be 2/3s the price. But my only complaint.", "author": "Timothy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-26", "description": "Cute backroom restaurant/bar with good mix of tunes (and not loud.)  My whiskey cocktail was good but not amazing.  We ordered four dishes...unfortunately, two were fried, so while delicious, they weren't special - they were just fried food.  The best dishes were the smallest in size.

Sit at the bar and order something, anything with your favorite booze and you will likely taste flavor combinations you've never had before. Have another. Admire the vintage glassware and perfect decor and decide you need to upgrade your cocktail glasses and light fixtures at home. Get hungry and order a thoughtfully prepared nibble, maybe the fried chicken thighs and wonder how they manage to get them so crispy. Ask the bartender (who's an unassuming pro) to pour you something else, and be astonished by a delicate floral sake that's so good you want to take it home to sip in bed. You consider taking the bartender home too.
