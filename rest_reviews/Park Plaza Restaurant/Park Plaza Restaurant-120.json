Where are the pickles, man? \n\nIt took a while to order, get our food, and get our check, so I wouldn't recommend this place late in the evening if you're looking for a quick meal. Other than that, it's your typical diner. I'm glad to know that I can get grub late at night in this area.\n\n I'd add it to the rolodex of munchable options.", "author": "Mickey M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-04", "description": "Wow..... before I get started.. I've attended Saint Francis College.. which is a few blocks from the location of this diner... I trained for cross country across the street from the diner at Cadman Plaza. Now... I only saw old people going in and out of this diner over the years.. I took it for a joke!... \n\nWell.. this weekend after spending time with this gorgeous female... we decided to stop in.. my appetite was on level 10!! It was about 3:30am... and the diner was open!! I was shocked! it was pretty packed.. not crowded but it had a nice crowd , considering it was 3:30 in the morning. \n\nI wanted to give this diner 5 stars... I seriously did... but the staff in this place is out of control! They were screaming at each other, cursing....... just not carrying themselves in a professional manner,  #madness #disturbing.\n\nMy judgment about the food..... GREAT!!! I ordered the fried chicken with two sides.. I just got 2 sides of mac \u0026 cheese. The chicken was... ehhhh..typical Fried Chicken, but that Mac \u0026 Cheese!!!!!!!!! Yeeeeeaaaahhhhh Budddddyyy!!!!!!   I'm talking not watery.. the cheese to roni proportions was on point! Meng... That cheese was rich! They didn't boil the roni too long or too short it was prepared just right.\n\nFor dessert............. I tried the Baklava..... Man... Oh......Man!!!! Mama told me there would be days like this!!! When I first tasted it in the diner.. it was room temp.. kinda cold.. nothing impressive I said let me take it home instead of discarding it. So when I got home.. I decided to heat up the rest...... Baby... Baby.....Baby!!!!! CHECKMATE!!!!!!!! ROGER THAT!!!!!!!!

My first time here someone at my table ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and had to send it back because they used bad lettuce in the wrap.  This is not the first time that we have received bad lettuce in wraps from here i guess they think we won't notice.  Last time we went my friend ordered a salad to go only to realize when we got home that the lettuce on the bottom was bad and completely inedible.  Many of my friends have gotten food poisoning from eating at this restaurant.

My dad was totally up for it, but my more sensible mom nixed the whole idea, but I've just never gotten my love affair for diners - there is literally something for everyone, and so unless the food is exceptionally greasy or the service is plain obnoxious, I can't say anything too awful. \n\nI was kind of struck by the strip of advertisements running along the length of this particular diner underneath its sign. From far away, the place looks more like an auto shop broadcasting hourly parking rates than a restaurant, but once you're inside, the first thing you see is a humongous glass case of cookies and pastries. It's not very well-lit inside during the daytime, so make sure to pick a seat by the window for some people-watching with your meal. Menu has everything from breakfast options (waffles, omelettes, pancakes), Greek dishes (gyros and skewers), some Mexican tossed in, burgers, dinner entrees, steaks, ribs, pretty much everything one could be in the mood for. I ordered the grilled chicken fajitas, which came with bean mash, rice, a tiny cup of guacamole, two soft flour tortillas, and lettuce and tomatoes. I think I ate until I was bursting at the seams, and I still barely made a dent on my plate. Everyone in my group finished everything on their plate, which sort of speaks to the general tastiness of the food. \n\nPlace is heavily frequented by lawyers and jurors from the courthouse across the park. Service was on the nicer end of the spectrum: one waiter dropped off a bag and take-out carton for my leftovers, and then another waiter came by, scolded the first waiter, and wrapped everything up for me. I would not object (get it?? 'Cause it's so close to the courthouse? Never mind) if someone suggested this place for lunch again.", "author": "Joy G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-26", "description": "Of all the places I've eaten, I give 5 stars to a diner? Damn straight I do!!! \n\nFirst off, the place is huge! It also has big booths so I have room for all the camera equipment and still have legroom. Second, I don't  think I have ever waited for a table in this diner. Third, the waiters are attentive, I've never heard of an order that was incorrect and I am never left waiting for anything I ask. Fourth, the food is damn good. I've had burgers, salads, sandwiches, turkey dinners, chicken cordon bleu, dessert, EVERYTHING!!! It has always been damn good. Twice the portions of manhattan at half the price! And fifth, this place is clean. Tables, floors, bathrooms, health department rating...All Clean!\n\nFive reasons to give it five stars!!!

I have have tried several entrees and a couple different dinner salads. All were quite good, better than diner quality standards.

I have been ordering from you for the past 4 months or so. \n\nMy fav thing on the menu is the cheese burger.. it's juicy and the cheese is always perfectly melted perfectly on it.

I ordered food once and the burger was okay but a little dry. I think it is a little pricey considering its food is not that spectacular.

It's the diner that I would sit in looking filthy and teary eyed for dinner after a long day of work and visiting my late granddad down the way at LICH before he passed away. I would eat here because I was too sad and exhausted to cook and the staff here never judged me. They would  just lead me to me to my table for one and ask NO questions while I cried and binged on fish and chips and key lime pie. Really exceptional diner fare. My faves are the grilled shrimp wraps, fish and chips, shakes and key lime pie. Food here is always delicious and fresh and you never feel rushed. The owners of this establishment are very kind, they never forget your face and treat you like family. Park Plaza recently opened a really cool looking Sports Bar area inside. The Sports Bar menu is shorter than the restaurant's main menu but everything on it is a treat.
