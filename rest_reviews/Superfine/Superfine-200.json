Then they tried to charge us $3.00 extra per card cause we were using credit cards  for part of the bill even though the menu didn't say so!

Unfortunately, he doesn't know his draft beers; he suggested their Kelso White Ale was similar to Blue Moon. Umm, no. Nothing like it! And it took more than 15 min to get this beer, when the bar was just steps away and he only had 2 tables to deal with. \nBetween that and seeing some of the negative reviews, I doubt I'll make the trip out for this place again.

Pretty relaxed scene, big space with a big bar down the middle.  We shared a salad and each got a main and 2 drinks, for a total of $85 all in.  Given the quality and portions, I walked away feeling like I paid a little too much for what I got, but it was still good and a pleasant experience overall.  Service was friendly, if not a tad slow.\n\nIf I'm in the area, I'd probably choose Rebar over this place, but it's a solid choice with a decent menu (that allegedly changes daily) and a well-stocked bar.

The atmosphere was great, there was live music, and our waiter was exceptionally friendly and natural. I won't condemn the food altogether as my boyfriend and I had the same thing, fish tacos. First of all, I love fish tacos in pretty much any format, except with salmon. I assume the fish they use varies by day, because the type of fish was not listed on the menu. Even though I do not prefer salmon, I think I would have enjoyed the tacos more if the salmon was seasoned, or there were additional dressings such as a tangy slaw or an aioli to boost it. The tortilla was very fresh and warm and the side salad was crisp and yummy. I would come again to try a cocktail and a different dish.", "author": "Ashley W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "Went here for brunch the other weekend as we were walking around Dumbo and this was close by. The atmosphere is great - there was a band playing that wasn't too loud, and they were great. But the food was very meh. I had the breakfast burrito and boyfriend has the huevos rancheros. Both were served with VERY runny pinto beans that took away from the rest of it.

I DO like this place and frequent here often. If you're going for a fun, lively, not pretentious place to eat, this place is definitely good. If you're looking for great food, you're probably better off going to a slightly fancier place down the block, like Al Mar. \n\nThey have a huge bar, plenty of tables, free pool table too.

It's the end of our week and we're out of a lot of stuff. (I was told by someone who ate here that they had several food dishes that were gone as well).\n\nThis discussion happened on a Saturday night. Now maybe this is the kind of place that gets great weeknight business, but the weekend is usually when bars and restaurants make a lot of money. So I ordered a Manhattan made with Knob Creek. It came out to sixteen dollars.

And like what most people have said- you walk in really really really wanting to like this place and wanting it to not disappoint.\n\nThis seems a bit harsh but never in my life have I ever been so pissed off at the attitude of an incompetent staff. Usually there are variables that go into an overall shitty dining experience. Maybe the server has too many tables and is overwhelmed. Maybe there's a new chef in the kitchen. Whatever, there are variables. I've worked in a restaurant, and I know that just because your experience sucks, does not mean the server is at fault, though they are the people who unfortunately have to deal with customers. \n\nIn this case, let's jus talk facts: \n\n- We didn't have utensils for a good 20 minutes or water. \n- There was string or a white long something- in our water \n- Our server didn't come by for a good 30-45 minutes. \n- After 45 minutes of sitting down, we did get bread for the table. \nCon: The bread looked like somebody was snacking on it. \n- Our actual meal took an even longer time. \n- During this time our sever checked on us a total amount of 0 times. However, she did manage to openly snack near the bar/kitchen in the back. (not a big deal, people get hungry) \n- We had none of the condiments our meal was supposed to come with. \n- The food was mediocre at best. If you're going to charge $18 for pasta, let's make sure it's at least warm when it arrives at your table. We won't even go into taste, since that's subjective.\n- Server, again, though we were burning laser eyes into the back of her skull was still busy snacking in the kitchen. Meanwhile the bus boy is running around, obviously busy.\n- Asked the hostess if we could just have someone come by our table. \n- It's a sunday night- meaning- it is not that busy. \n\nOverall: HUGELY disappointed. Maybe ordering drinks at the bar and not getting table service would be the right way to go. I wouldn't recommend having dinner or an actual sit down meal here. You're going to do more watching the server eat than actually eating yourself.", "author": "jill l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-14", "description": "Food was good but the service was indifferent at best.  Have servers check in every once in a while. Have hostess NOT slam the bill on the table.  Say thank you.  Smile, say hello, engage the customer.

I kept eating and eating waiting for a sense of satisfaction but the food was without any merit as far as culinary accomplishments. I liked the restaurant itself, the service was friendly and tried hard, but you just need to invest a chef - c'mon, this food is lousy, if this was a small city in Oklahoma, perhaps it would be understandable, but dumbo, brooklyn, nyc - just not acceptable.  based solely on what you served you really should start again from scratch.
