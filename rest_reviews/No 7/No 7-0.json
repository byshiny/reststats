It was amusing to bypass the smug faces and eye rolls I encountered when we were seated as soon as we walked in! \n\nTip #2: ask for alcohol...sure the drinks already come with it but watered down doesn't even begin to describe it. My Bloody Mary was spicy tomato juice and my friend's (first) mimosa was basically OJ. We spoke up on round two and that was quickly remediated.\n\nTip #3: strawberries, cheese and fish just don't go together--skip the fish tacos or try being proactive with your requirements. I was also still very hungry after finishing mine so ended up buying a side of fries to fill me up. One friend of mine got the shrimp and grits...it was ok but I give No. 7 a 5 star rating for creativity with the dish--it looked like a bowl of ramen! The real 5 star (apparently) was the steak and fries; according to my friend \"it was the best steak and fries meal I've ever had in my 42 years!\"--that's a heck of compliment!\n\nI won't be back, there are just too many great options in Brooklyn! \n\nP.S. the booth tables in the back need to get fixed...our table was bent, we were fearful our plates would slide.", "author": "Nina S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-11", "description": "I got the Broccoli tacos and they were amazing! It came with only two which I thought was not going to fill me up but it was actually so filling I had to force myself to finish the second one.

I heard the fried chicken here was great so that's what I ordered. When the chicken came it looked perfect and the skin looked very crispy. But when you take the first bite you are underwhelmed and disappointed. The pieces of chicken were not the juiciest and the meat lacked flavor. All the flavor was in in the skin which was a disappointment. The cocktail I had was great. Would come again but maybe for drinks and another dish on the menu", "author": "Andre O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-05", "description": "Wow, what a cute little brunch spot. Dropped in here with two friends for a casual brunch in Ft. Greene and was pleasantly surprised. The interior is very well decorated and the back portion of the restaurant has two skylights which creates a bright and welcoming atmosphere. I imagine on a cold snowy day this would be a cozy place for brunch or a drink. Ok on to food/drinks. Our cocktails and beers were all delicious and wonderfully done, we were even given a free drink on the kitchen (pssst thanks!). Food was very tasty, I had the corned beef Reuben with broccoli which I was a little nervous about but turned out to be very good. Their shoestring fries are AMAZING. The two critiques of the food we had were that the Rueben needed a bit of acid, without sauerkraut I was left wanting just the slightest bit more, and my friends commented that they wished their fried chicken was a tad bit crispier. When it came to pay we had some card issues but the staff was so kind and attentive they worked it out easily. Would definitely stop back in when I come to Brooklyn next.", "author": "Patrick T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-28", "description": "No 7 is a bit hidden, literally directly behind the C train entrance which makes it feel so very NYC to eat there:) The space has a bar in the front and a dining area in the back. It is spacious enough to feel like you can have an intimate conversation without being overheard. \n\nWe were here on a Sunday night, so it was rather empty. The service was attentive, friendly and prompt. Everything you could ask for. The atmosphere here is dim and rustic. \n\nI totally went for it with my entree choice and got the friend chicken sandwich which had spicy maple syrup, mayo, fries and a pickle. Though totally horrible for my ass, it was a pretty heavenly combination. The infusion of syrup gave it just the right amount of sweet and savory balance. My date had the pan roasted arctic char, which from my taste of was also wonderful. It came with roasted fennel, golden squash puree, cherry tomato salad. Overall we really enjoyed our dinner here and will be back for sure.", "author": "Ren\u00e9e G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-15", "description": "This place never disappoints. I like the ambient lighting, which makes it great for a date or a cozy dinner with friends. The food is always consistent and reliable, especially their specialty - the broccoli tacos. I can't come to No 7 without getting them - they're THAT good (we've tried making them at home, and it just wasn't the same). I am also a lover of thin, crunchy French Fries, and No 7 is probably my favorite place in the NYC area to get them.

I was unsure how it would be because the reviews are mediocre and I found the sandwich shop to be just okay. The menu looked good, so I went for it anyway. They take reservations, which I love. They sat my large party immediately. The server was very nice while still seeming sincere and not stopping by too often. I started with the Rosemary Limeaid. It didn't really taste like rosemary, but it was delicious! I ordered the fish tacos and they were delicious and HUGE. I would definitely order again. My boyfriend and I split a pancake and that was pretty good, but nothing special.

It was a bummer, but I've honestly never been treated so kindly by a business in this type of situation. We were instead seated at the bar and the manager \u0026 entire staff made sure numerous times that we were being accommodated for the inconvenience.  Living in NYC I'm used to things going wrong unexpectedly, but I'm not used to people actually caring about the customer as attentively as No 7 did. The bartenders were extremely friendly, and the waitstaff made sure to help me find options that were in line with my vegan diet in a non-judgemental way. \nThe food was almost as amazing as the service (not quite sure which was better!). My partner and I opted for a pre-fixe menu, which usually means the place cuts corners to get you out quickly, but we've rarely been so satisfied. The broccoli tacos are so tasty, and it's always a relief to find options that work with my dietary restrictions that aren't just fake-meat. My partner raved about the quality of the shrimp, and said the steak was one of the best he's ever tasted. If you like hot sauce, definitely try their house made version.

They created a customized drink menu for us and printed it out day of, it looked great and everyone LOVED ordering them!

Conveniently located literally RIGHT next to the Lafayette Ave C stop, this restaurant features a substantial bar area where people basically don't talk to each other while they nurse their drinks either on the bar stools or the lounge near the entrance. \n\nThe inside seating area opens up underneath a massive sun roof and windows strategically placed at the highest point on the wall before it's basically just ceiling. The decor is typical New American (aka wooden paneling, shades of brown and more brown, and white walls). It's sort of romantic at least when the restaurant isn't packed, but then, once it does become packed, it becomes rather difficult to have a really substantial conversation.\n\nOn the plus side, though, the food is really REALLY good. Yelp reviewers suggested the double decker broccoli tacos, and boy, were they a good choice. The black bean hummus was savory, the broccoli was tender, and HELLO can you ever go wrong with tacos? We also had the General Tso's grilled chicken sandwich (that sauce was SPICY and definitely...not General Tso's but it was delicious so, however questionable that name is, redemption exists) and the cheeseburger. Solid solid solid.\n\nWe also split a bottle of Verdejo because on Wednesdays, bottles of wine ARE HALF PRICE. Bring a date, order a bottle, and you won't even care that they give you candles for your table before the sun has set while you're sitting directly underneath the sun roof.", "author": "Kristen L."}], "servesCuisine": "American (New)", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "No 7", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "7 Greene Ave", "postalCode": "11238", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/lt-w9NOIuTSmE73S6_jLew/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185226370"}
