Wildly unwelcoming manager kicks you out. An owner spies on you. Go anywhere else unless the owner and manager adjust their attitude.\n\nA few us planned to meet up at Blue Cafe, have something to drink and eat before heading off to our destination. While we waited for everyone to arrive, some of us having bought drinks, the manager told us that the owner watches the cafe via a camera and insists that no-one stays more than 5 minutes. Our offer to get food right away, even though we were waiting for everyone to arrive before doing that, had no effect. If you've ordered food, you still have just 5 minutes to eat it then split, he explained. The tables were not full. No-one was waiting to sit. We were at just one table of six, some of us standing. \n\nWith so many options, there is no reason put up with this aggressive inhospitality.", "author": "Janine W."}], "servesCuisine": "Cafes", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Blue Cafe", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "50 Hoyt St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/HBmje9tO7lDXgUk4ZSHD6g/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185220888"}
