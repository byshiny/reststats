There was not one morsel of duck or sausage or bacon for that matter. It was a large crock of very tasty white beans in sauce but for 19 dollars a bite of duck was expected. I wanted to like this homey restaurant and I enjoyed the cheese and meat starter but really, it was very disappointing.", "author": "Judith D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-05", "description": "Excellent French bistro, fresh food, great atmosphere.

My latte was poorly made, and also the smallest I've ever seen.   26 bucks for a small glass of juice, a poorly made latte and some eggs.   No thanks.", "author": "Jennifer F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-21", "description": "very nice and cozy place, had dinner with my friend there. the food was very good, but service........ i wish it could be better", "author": "Janna Y."}], "servesCuisine": "French", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Caf\u00e9 Paulette", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "1 S Elliott Pl", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/s0Kk96xhzNT-I-hEXQqtaA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188528582"}
