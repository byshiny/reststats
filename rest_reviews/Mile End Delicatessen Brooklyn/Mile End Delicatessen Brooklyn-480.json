This was a happy surprise to that visual.\n\nMile End is tiny, but potent. There are three long 4-person communal tables and one tiny 2-top jammed in the window. There are also seats at the counter where you can be served smoked meat. It's just all about the smoked meat. I actually overheard the guy telling a to-go customer on the way out, \"You are the proud owner of a smoked meat sandwich. Enjoy.\" That was awesome.\n\nI ordered the brisket (smoked meat) which comes on rye with mustard. It came out smelling like brisket heaven. One issue is that this sandwich comes on a tiny plate. I like a small plate, but the problem here is that the meat is so tender that it falls off the sandwich and when it does it skips off the other piece of bread and onto the table because there is little room for fallen meat. I actually found the sandwich to look small, but there is a lot of meat on it. I think the $8 for the sandwich is very fair.\n\nThe flavor was phenomenal and the texture was moist. Some of the pieces had tiny bits of fat on them that were so good. The crust of the rye bread was soft enough to not create an impediment, but the sandwich is a little messy. Luckily, you can just use a fork to scoop up the leftover smoked meat. OK, the ones that fell on the table somehow found their way back onto my fork - that table looked clean.\n\nI washed the brisket down with a Virgil's root beer which was really good. The service was attentive and very friendly. I really like when places are appreciative of people checking the place out and the server asked questions about where I heard about it and was so nice in general.\n\nMile End is worth a mile walk and then some. Special thanks to Deanna W. for getting the RotD for her review of Mile End, it tipped the scale to make me go and I am so glad.", "author": "Jonathan G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-31", "description": "Ok....this place wasnt awful...but it wasnt great.\nI was born and raised in Montreal. I've lived there for the first 20 years of my life and grew up eating poutine and smoked meat. I go back home every couple of months and make sure that I eat them both. NYC just cannot get this right. It drives me insane!! The owner is from Montreal, he should know what he's doing. I thought that the food wasnt bad...but only compared to what I have eaten in NYC. If this place was in Montreal it would have been closed by now for sure. \n\nMeat has a different flavor. Sandwich is small. Not terrible,,,but DEFINETLY not Montreal.\nPoutine: Fries were good. Cheese was good. Gravy was not. Who uses turkey gravy on a poutine? killed it for me.\n\nPomme frites and T-poutine are garbage. So I would say this is the best poutine I've had in NYC.

But the French fries are simple amazing.  Some of the best I have ever had.  The gravy was ok-I thought the fries were much better plain with the cheese or with ketchup.

Maybe it's because my stomach is still hating me and getting over how stuffed it feels or my brain is still savoring the mind-explosion of deliciousness that was the food from Mile End.  Either way, it benefits you because I'm here writing this.  \n\nIf you've ever visited Montreal, you've probably been directed to get some poutine and thought it was magical.  Well with Mile End you don't have to wait until your next trip there nor do you have to settle for less-than-magical poutine.  I came here with two others and we ordered two appetizers, but each had poutine for our main courses.  The classic poutine came with mozzarella curds, mushroom gravy, and perfectly cooked and salted fries.  Someone in my party got the one version with smoked brisket meat, and it added a whole other dimension of deliciousness.  I regretted eating it, but I also couldn't stop because it was just too damn good.  \n\nWe ordered the chopped liver and knish for appetizers.  The chopped liver was a spread with egg and onion relish.  It came with a risen pletzel which was airy yet solid.  The chopped liver was great, but I could have passed on the knish.  \n\nWhen Zach, our waiter, came back and asked us if we wanted dessert, all of us said \"no, we're full.\"  When he left to get the check, we started mumbling that we wanted to try the dessert.  Zach came back and we told him that we changed our minds and he suggested the honey cake.  Let me tell you, the honey cake was damn delicious.  \n\nI think this might be my new favorite find in Brooklyn.  Definitely a great place that knows what they're doing and does it well.", "author": "Christopher T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-19", "description": "...Not overly seasoned, this is a deceptively light yet filling sandwich, with its unique flavors and textures--pliant pink slabs of meat with tongue-teasing, slightly burnt edges--it needed nothing more than the reliable platform of two slices of untoasted rye bread and a \"wink\" of mustard to shine....", "author": "Kerry C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-25", "description": "Best smoked meat sandwich I've had in the NYC area-- better than Katz's.\n\nBased on one sampling, I'd have to say that Schwartz's is a little better. \n\nMile End uses 'natural' (free range, no antibiotics, etc) meat-- a big plus--, while Schwartz's uses industrial grade. However, I found Mile End's meat a little drier than Schwartz's, a tiny bit over-salted, and the peppery/spicy flavor profile a bit overpowering, masking the taste of the meat itself. \n\nAlso, Schwartz's let's you pick the level of fattiness-- lean, medium, fatty-- whereas Mile End didn't provide this option. But this might just be because the waitress forgot to ask.  \n\nThe sandwiches, by the way, are a little small for the price (smaller than Schwartz's and other comparable delis)-- especially since they don't come with anything on the side. \n\nThe coffee was very good, coleslaw very good, fries okay. \n\nMy friend and I went on a Thursday during lunchtime. Nice, pretty, simple space with wooden tables, relaxed atmosphere, much more laid back than the always overcrowded and frenetic Schwartz's. The black Kafka-esque lamps extending from the walls are a little weird, a little too close to one's head, and potentially block the view of the person across from you. Coat hangers above each table a nice, convenient touch. \n\nOverall, the best smoked meat-style deli in New York, I'd wager. The space is pretty small, so I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes very crowded, with long lines waiting outside, within six months.", "author": "Svend E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-10-22", "description": "Pains me to have to write this because I used to live in the hood when it first opened but this place has gone downhill.

I recently went to Montreal and became a poutine fan. Upon returning to Brooklyn I decided to search for some local versions of this classic Quebec dish.
