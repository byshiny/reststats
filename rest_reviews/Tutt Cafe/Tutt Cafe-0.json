Otherwise I had a terrible meal here. There's only one guy working here so service is very slow, albeit friendly. The roasted leg of lamb was so tough and looked and tasted like it was boiled.

It came with 5 types of things - we got 2 different types of chickpeas, a regular salad, stuffed grape leaves, and hummus.  The pita was good.\n\nAlso split the mixed grill. The rice was bland. The pork chops were too burnt. The lamb was the best part, but not extraordinary in any way.\n\nThey also didn't give us any hot sauce. Maybe you have to ask specifically?\n\nTutt Cafe may be better if you actually go there, but I won't be ordering delivery from them again.", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-24", "description": "Love Tutt Cafe - one of the gems of Brooklyn Heights!

Super friendly and cheery people here.\n\nBut the food.. The green pitza is the greatest most interesting pizza you'll ever try (leeks, scallions, fenugreek mix topped with lots of cheese). My boyfriend exclaimed it was the best pizza he's ever had. \n\nAlso had zaatar bread, a little more oily than usual, but still really good. I got it with the baba ganoush, spread it on the zaatar bread and it is heavenly. They serve it with some pita bread....really fresh and delicious. Cant wait to go back and try more of this amazing food.", "author": "Michele B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-19", "description": "The food was really good!! We enjoyed the green pizza!! When we come back we are definitely ordering this again! We also got a decent sized portion of marinade chicken which was not dry at all and babaghanoush accompanied with pita bread. I really enjoyed the babaghanoush. The only downside that I have is the fact that we waited awhile before we got our food. We weren't given like an appetizer like pita with some hummus while we waited which would have been nice! Anyways we were really impressed with the food and that everything was reasonably priced which means we will definitely be back!", "author": "Miriam W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-03", "description": "The wait was quite long to have our meals to our table and there are also lots of pesky flies but for some reason it was all worth it for the delicious 15$ grilled lamb chops!!!!

Gyro - never tried such version of the meat - some sort of minced meat with spam-like consistency. Sauces were just ok, bland. Pita was the only thing which was good and seemed homemade.\nService: with 3-4 tables had to wait more than 10mins to get our card back after it was swiped.

Imagine pizzeria with Middle Eastern spice smells and some Middle Eastern art works on the walls.  The pictures say a lot about the atmosphere of the place, not ambiance, but atmosphere.  The pictures in the frames are super weathered and look as if they have been through a really bad rain storm.  Expect it to be humid and sort of warm.\n\nThere's sort of waiter service but not really.  The waiter service was just one of the guys behind the counter.  Don't expect service to be good.\n\nThe service is very slow.  For drinks we got water and cold mint tea.  The best thing is there is a little tiny cooler filled with ice next to the drinks on the left hand side of the restaurant towards the counter area.  That's where they scoop out the ice!  It was pretty silly and I had a good laugh.\n\nWe ordered falafel as an appetizer, which I would not recommend.  Dry, underseasoned and actually pretty small portion for how much you pay.\n\nThe sandwich and plates on the other hand are quite a deal with pretty sizeable portions but the food itself is really just average.  The plate comes with the meat you chose, a small salad and hummus or baba ghanoush.\n\nWould definitely come back but to try the pizzas people rave about or get another plate.", "author": "Kent C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-15", "description": "2nd time coming here and the food is good!\n\nI came in to grab dinner before my last class of the semester.. \n\nFood is great here and the price point is good, the small toubeleh was a little overpriced though for the amount you get. \n\nOrdered: Leg of Lamb plate $13, small toubeleh $6, food was good, I'm a big guy and I was full, I think the last time I came they gave you more hummus. \n\n4 out of 5.
