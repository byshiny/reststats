This time the choice was mine to make and although I've frequent other spots in the area, I wanted to try something different. As it has done many times before, YELP saved me. Gran Electrica won the day. \n\nGran Electrica seems to be quite popular and so I would highly recommend that you make a reservation. It's a small place but absolutely charming. This night I was dining with a friend and so I guess reserving a table was easy. Although they have seating on the inside, we opted to eat out on their patio. I'm glad we did. It doesn't have much of view but the ambiance it provides is cute. \n\nThe staff was excellent. I didn't catch the brothers name that served us but he was definitely on point and our tip reflected that. As for the food, I wish they would add another taco. Most places give you at least three. The two fish tacos were superb but two left us wanting more. The salsa and guacamole and margaritas were equally delish. So, if your in the area, make a reservation and enjoy.", "author": "Percy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-26", "description": "Gran Electrica reigns supreme as both a dinner or brunch spot in the summer months. I've been here before for dinner and had a great experience, so when friends recommended this spot for brunch on a sunny Sunday, I was in.\n\nGarden seating is where it's at. I had only ever dined there at night but it's equally as beautiful in the day.\n\nThe drinks were spot on. I went with the Pepito which was extremely refreshing. My friends tried the Paloma and the Sangria which they raved about as well.\n\nI will say that the portions are pretty small for the price, but the ambiance really makes it worth the splurge.", "author": "Cristina G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-19", "description": "This review is specifically for the bar.\nAfter walking the Brooklyn Bridge at night, a friend and I were looking for a little place to sit, have a drink, and maybe munch on something.  We had heard that this place had great churros, and we could get a drink too, so we thought we'd try it.\n\nFirst of all, the churros were NOT what we expected.  See my picture if you're interested in what we got.  I don't know what we were expecting... but it wasn't this.  They seemed like they had been packaged.\n\nAnyways, the churros aside, the drinks and bartender were great.  We enjoyed just sitting and taking in the atmosphere.  I really did like the decor and our bartender was attentive, but not too attentive.  It didn't seem like this was too touristy. The feel was local, but it could have just been the evening. \n\nI would probably come back, but I wouldn't order the churros.", "author": "Joley B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-19", "description": "Came here with a friend to get drinks and catch up. Dumbo has become pretty touristy but this place keeps it cool. When we got there around 5:30 pm it wasn't that busy and we stayed for a looong time. Sitting at the bar, the bartender never rushed us to leave and even as it got really busy they stayed attentive to us. The drinks are also reasonably priced. We ordered all the margaritas, the cucumber (pepino) margarita was my favorite. The grapefruit marg was only a bit spicy, with I nice grapefruit flavor. \n\nWe ordered the sangria tostada, I thought it was awful. Not the bartender's fault because they make it in batches before the day. Neither of us liked it and a couple girls next to us also ordered it an complained of the taste. This sangria has a very strong flavor of mezcal (smoky) but with the fruitiness it's just not a great combo. I ended up returning it and getting another margarita.", "author": "Melinda R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-25", "description": "It would be hard to think of Gran Electrica as anything less than a 4.5 star place. Occasionally, the host area doesn't live up to the standard of the restaurant, but that's about it. Literally this place is awesome. The drinks are my favorite in the neighborhood. There's a particular mezcal cocktail that's not to be missed - reminds a little of an old fashioned. I've never had less than a great dish here, the food is simply incredible.

Mescal? I'm in love with Brooklyn already. Forget the City. Well, you don't have to because cross the bridge and you are in the heart of it anyway.\n\nAll I know is that this night was about meeting one of my besties from DC who resides in the area now and we were staying within walking distance of Mexican food. Our hotel recommended Gran Electrica. It's small, intimate and has a fun decor. Similar to our ethnic haunts of restaurants and bars in the District and Virginia (where we spent time during our 20's and 30's). We had electric soul then and we have no reason to give it up now!\n\nBoth of us married and husbands in tow, tonight was about great company and good food. The word Gran fits more with our age now, but thank goodness you can sit in a room and have a conversation at an appropriate noise level. My meal consisted of a Agave cocktail (wait for the punch line) with a sugar rim that was superb. Of, course I got the tacos and a side of rice. Forget the signs outside (on this night, although they will make you laugh), the tacos won and no need for tequila as the only people we were texting this night were in our own group. \n\nMy friend and I have dined at George Bush's (senior) favorite restaurant in Falls Church, VA, so intrigued our friends purchased us ALL the Bok Choy plants in the restaurant to decorate my new place at the time (and struggled to get them home safely), we attended Shaquille O'Neill 21'st birthday party at Lulu's in DC (before anyone really knew who he was) and these are the tame experiences of our existence. We had MANY coincidences, more than any two people probably could have, which no longer make things a coincidence. Perhaps, it was just meant to be. I love my homegirl and Brooklyn. Our husbands area pretty amazing too. \n\nAnother reason to eat at Gran Electric. Napa! We will have to visit the NorCal location on our tour of Jam Cellars and BottleRock.\nGran El\u00e9ctrica create cocktails that give back to charities, such as Black Lives Matter, Red Nose Day, The UN Refugee Agency, etc. \nPrior to our trip, the son and daughter in-law recently discovered a bat in their home in New England and had to bring in an exterminator. \nGran El\u00e9ctrica has a line of \"bat friendly\" agave spirits (I sure hope that's the one I tried). Apparently, there would be no agave without bats. So the punch line is...when life gives you bats, it's time to make agave!

Food is a bit on the pricier side and the restaurant does not offer complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the Carnitas tacos ($12 for 2). The taco was good but on the dry side and did not come with any sides.

Gran Electrica not only provided delicious food but great music.\n\nIt's dimly lit, so this place makes a great date night spot. I really like the design of the restaurant; it's intimate, romantic, and carefully curated. I came with 2 other friends, and we were seated rather quickly. I ordered the fish and pork tacos, the plantains, and the churros.\n\nThe fish tacos were my favorite thing, I had to order another one! It was perfectly fried, and the flavors surrounding it were perfect. I enjoyed the pork tacos, but they didn't give me as much joy as the fish ones. I loved that the plantains were covered in cheese, and they were perfectly ripe. I loved the churros; they gave chocolate and caramel sauce, and the caramel sauce was my favorite. I will definitely be back again to try the guacamole and the short rib entree.", "author": "Renee C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-08", "description": "I come here every time I'm in New York, and the experience is always amazing.

Finally I changed that. Knowing they have backyard, my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to pop in for a light dinner on a nice night. \n\nThe good: the food was tasty, the service was attentive, and the backyard was pretty.\n\nThe bad: I should have guessed when I noticed we were surrounded by tourists and not locals that Gran Electrica wouldn't meet the hype. I hate when it's happy hour but that doesn't extend to certain parts of the restaurant. Always feels a little sneaky. Unfortunately we were unaware of this until we sat down. Had we known we might have just stayed at the bar. The food was very overpriced for the small portions. Chips, salsa and guacamole for $16? They came in small bowls with a laughably small amount of chips. Not worth the money at all. Finally, within an hour of eating both my fianc\u00e9 and I had terrible stomach pains.  Of course we can't know for sure what caused it but the food at Gran Electrica was the only thing we had together that day as we were both coming from work. \n\nIn general, I can see the appeal but Gran Electrica isn't for me.
