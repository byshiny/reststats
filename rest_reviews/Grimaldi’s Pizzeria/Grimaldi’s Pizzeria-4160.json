Ehhh...I can't say the same for this place. The pizza really just tasted mediocre to me. I had a small, white sauce, with ham, pepperoni, and Italian sausage. I really wanted to love this place, since I waited OVER AN HOUR and it was highly recommended by locals. Honestly, I gotta agree with fellow yelpers and say this place is over-rated. The restaurant is loud and extremely crowded and cramped, I wouldn't recommend mommies to eat-in with their babies.", "author": "Juleo R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-26", "description": "One of it's kind pizza...

There's pretty much always a line out the door for a table, but the wait is well worth it. The pies taste fresh and arrive quite quickly. Afterwards, get ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory and walk around the park or cross the Brooklyn Bridge : )", "author": "Kelsey K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-19", "description": "\"Very good the pizza was.

A small pepperoni (6 slices) was MORE than enough to feed my friend, Lindsey. and me.  We each were only able to eat 2 slices.  Not my favorite pizza, just because I'm not a huge fan of straight up slices of mozz on my pizza.  But definitely worthy of a try.  And prices are decent too.  $12 for a small pizza sans toppings.\n\nOk, so the service was absolutely horrendous.  There was a line of about 10 people at noon on a Monday when we went, but we prob didn't wait more than 25 minutes to get in.  Definite plus.  The guy/host that runs the show (who may be the owner or manager or who knows) was really nice.  He greeted us when we got in and made sure to ask how things were and ask that we come back when we left.  Another plus.  But the waiter was horrible.  They have so many people wanting to eat there that they just want to get you in and out.  I asked for a root beer and I got a 'tude from the waiter saying they didn't have any today.  He was probably annoyed just because that's prob the 192384th time he's had to say that today, but honestly, how was I supposed to know?  Then the table next to us tried to get his attn and he completely ignored them.  I was sorely disappointed.  And his tip showed it.  I worked in the restaurant biz in college and even if you're in a crap mood, you best move on and do what you're supposed to do - serve and please the customer.\n\nI wanted to take my family there in April, when they come to visit, and I probably still will.  But only for the satisfaction of saying they've been to the famed Grimaldi's.", "author": "Lisa W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-23", "description": "Good Pizza but not worth the wait. There are dozens of pizza places in NY that is just as good or better without having to wait in line forever. The new location is bigger but the oven capacity did not look like it increased which means longer wait for your food.

We finally got to try it. It lived up the the hype. They use real pieces of cheese and not the shredded variety which makes the pizza even better. Add on some extra garlic and wow, amazing pizza. Why can't we have pizzas like this back on SF bay area?

So i have to admit the pizza was very good and i enjoy every bite of my thin crust coal brick oven sausage, pepperoni, ham, mushroom pizza and i must say price was not as bad as i thought but is it worth the wait and to deal with a grumpy old man prolly not so thats where the 3stars comes in other than that u should try it once and next time i will order by phone to take out and eat it by the Bklyn Park to avoid all that traffic.", "author": "Tommy J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-04", "description": "I'm pretty skeptical of anything anyone tells me is \"famous\" or a tourist attraction, so i didn't expect a whole lot from this place, and boy I was wrong!  I'm not sure how long we waited in the line that sprawled down the block, but it was definitely worth it!  My five friends and I ordered two large pies - one with roasted red peppers and mushrooms, the other with capers, sun dried tomatoes and extra basil.  Both pizzas were absolutely scrumptious.  They use high quality ingredients and have amazing thin crust.  Yum!", "author": "Nicole L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-05", "description": "Good pizza.

So, we opted to take out our pizza instead (still had to wait -20 min before they'd take our order) and grabbed an ice cream cone from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory while we waited.  \nWhen the pizza was ready, we brought it down by the water and enjoyed a fantastic view of the Brooklyn Bridge as we dined on a deliciously smokey thin crust pizza.  Yes, it was good, but if I had waited over an hour for it, I would have been very disappointed.  The pizza toppings were a little sparse and very poorly distributed, such that parts of my pizza only had tomato sauce on it - no cheese or anything.  Maybe Domino's can get away with that, but with Grimaldi's reputation, I would have expected better.", "author": "Cindy W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-19", "description": "You'd have to give 5 stars to Grimaldi's!

Limited waiting room inside means standing in a long line outside, which isn't ideal in the winter. Once inside, though, a delicious aroma assaults your senses and entices your taste buds. The pizza was good, and the fresh mozzarella is definitely a plus. We tried onions, sausage, and red peppers, and it was tasty but honestly not the best I've had. Maybe we went wrong with the peppers, but I wanted to try them since it was something different. The service is brisk and the waiters aren't generous with smiles, but it didn't bother me too much... though it bothered a friend of mine. I chalked it up to the stereotypical New York experience.
