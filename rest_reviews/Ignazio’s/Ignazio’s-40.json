A large pizza consisted of 8 big slices and was more than enough for us. The service was also fantastic as our waitress was very attentive and checked in to see how everything was.\n\nI highly recommend going here if you are in the Dumbo/Brooklyn Bridge area.", "author": "Jake Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-23", "description": "Don't expect to be seated when arriving, there is almost constantly a minimum of 20 min queueing (which is not a bad thing as long as the experience is worth it!!).

I don't see the big deal of NY pizza. \n\nBefore my trip to NY, I gave up pizza for the year.  My one exception was going to be my trip here since everyone raves about it.  Well, poop.  I really thought NY pizza would be better.  Is it because I didn't grow up with their 'style' of pie?  I was perplexed.\n\nI was told by a local on the plane ride here to go to Ignazio's.  She was sure I would love it as it was her favorite place for pizza.  Since we knew we were walking the Brooklyn Bridge across it worked out great.  The service here was good with no complaints. The dining room is large and kept very clean.  It is a Cash Only establishment so be prepared.  They do have an ATM but I'm sure it would be an expensive fee to use.\n\nUnfortunately, I was underwhelmed by the pizza.  The fennel sausage used was fantastic but the pizza itself was not to my liking.  I know you're supposed to fold the pizza and eat.  It was really soggy except for the outside crust.  Not at all what I was hoping for. \n\nI guess I'm just not a New Yorker thinking their pizza is the best.  I would head elsewhere.", "author": "Bethany E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-24", "description": "TexMex pizza has the best crust.

You're not coming here for the food - you're coming here because you've been walking around DUMBO and this place (right on the water) offers fantastic views and spectacular lighting depending on when you're here.\n\nI'm a big fan of the White Clam Pizza - and by White Clam Pizza (capitalized), I mean Pepe's White Clam Pizza (New Haven, CT - best pizza in the world).\n\nThis white clam pizza is of the lower-case variety.  Canned clams, desiccated buccal presence.\n\nUnlike many places in NYC, there seemed to be more focus on turning over the room than taking pride in the product / service itself.  Servers and floor managers didn't seem all that interested in creating an experience - just processing bodies.\n\nFrankly, three-stars is kind, considering the fare itself, but there is an extra star earned just because of the location itself.  \n\nSo, there you have it.", "author": "Daniel P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-14", "description": "I ordered the \"Pizza Filia Rex.\"\n\nThe ingredients are very fresh and creative.

The pizza also has a fantastic scent and overall good taste.\n\nIt doesn't align with my pizza preferences hence only rating it a 3/5. I also felt it was a bit too black on the bottom but this is also a matter of preference.

Unfortunately, Ignazio's stood out for all the wrong reasons. Pretty empty during lunch rush, and nowhere as good as the other two big names around the corner. Somehow, their tomato sauce is incredibly watery. Crust was solid though. Not too thick, but thin enough to still be crispy (just the right amount of burnt).\n\nYou can order from their pies, or make your own based on their toppings. We did a standard cheese pie, a pepperoni, and constructed our own fennel sausage and peppers. The pepperoni was the best of the three, which was a bit disappointing. They top all their pizzas with fresh basil though, which I always appreciate\n\nNot sure if I'll come back, especially since it's cash only!", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-31", "description": "My Husband and I ate here on Saturday afternoon, we sat at the bar and it was wonderful.

The sauce was tasty.  The cheese was good.  The crust had just the right amount of crunch.  The cheese was running off a bit but that could be to the heat and with the quality of ingredients - it really didn't matter.\n\nI have been around Manhattan and right now in my opinion the best slice is from, Sauce but Ignazio's cheese slice has dethroned the king.\n\nAs for the rating.

I have been to this pizza place twice before, had a wrap, Brooklyn lager, one whole big clam pizza with my friend! I loved the food. Today I wanted to try something new, may be another wrap, salad and a drink during my work break. As soon as I walked in asked for table for one. The host (elderly looking Asian woman) looked around the restaurant ( few 2 tabs tables were empty) and shoot me super surprising question -\"are you having slice or pie? We don't sell slices here!\" I said I know- but she persisted to try somewhere! Shamelessly I even told her I'm there for wrap! But she wouldn't let me in! I walked out saying 'you are very rude'! She said yes thank you!!!!\nHow the heck you add 20% tips to all your checks on the first place? I understand it's a tourist place but how do you deny serving one person???? I wasn't there to eat for free! Shout out to this freaking bad service and yes I'm going to let as many people I know about this senseless act!Completely bullshit and unprofessional!\nGood luck!", "author": "Smita C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-15", "description": "Talk about bad customer service....Juliana's and Grimaldi's were both out of the picture for my mother and I, since my 1 year old was in tow and waiting in line is NOT his style. My mother is visiting from London, and really wanted pizza, so we gave this one a try, since Brooklyn Bridge Park is one of her favorite spots. We arrived about 12:20 on a Thursday, and the hostess told us that we would have to be out by 1:00pm to accommodate a reservation they had. Excellent! My 1 year old would also prefer that. So she seated us. We ordered a medium margherita promptly, and waited for our food....and waited...and waited, while others around us who were seated after us were served. After 30 minutes I asked the hostess/waitress what was going on, since it was now 12:50pm, and she told us we had to be out by 1pm. Her reply? \"I warned you that you'd have to be out by 1pm. I'm not responsible if the kitchen is slow. I'll go check\" and literally walked away before I could respond. So I am responding on Yelp. WOW. Indeed you are not responsible if the kitchen is slow, but you ARE responsible for making a note to make sure we get our food quickly so we can get in and out if you decide to seat us. As far as I know, pizza cooks pretty fast in a hot oven. You are also the same person responsible for delivering food to tables around us who were seated after us. And you are responsible for having a terrible attitude. You could have at least offered to make sure it was out and packed for us to take out after we waited so long. I was frankly appalled by the customer service, so I simply left, happy that I had packed a sandwich for my toddler. The pizza did look and smell good, it's unfortunate that I can't review it since we never got any.
