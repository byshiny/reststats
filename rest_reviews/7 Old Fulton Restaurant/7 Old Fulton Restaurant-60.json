If you LOVE food you will love this restaurant. You can eat, drink and be merry and the owner and his wife are so wonderful. They treat you like family when you come in. If you haven't been here yet you must stop in and have a full meal! But don't leave without eating some delicious homemade dessert. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is to DIE for.

Skinny black long hair. Would not tell me her name. \nI don't care if you are having a bad day... no excuse to be rude to people.

Yes. How weird is that. Wait staff couldn't remember our order after taking it. It was not hard. We ordered 2 linguine and 1 fettuccine. He completely forgot the order of the table next to us.

Though the waiter was a little hard to understand, the service was excellent. I had the salmon with Dijon sauce and it was delicious, my parents had the burger and a pasta and meat dish respectively and loved them. We finished off with a great tiramisu.Finally the atmosphere was very nice making the place feel more spacious.", "author": "John M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-24", "description": "I have never experienced such a disrespect and horrible  customer service in my life ! I just walked in to get a table for me and my girlfriend but I asked where was the bathroom first and she said no that I had to buy something then I can use the van I kept explaining to her that I was going to buy something but I need to use the restroom urgent. But the short Mexican lady doesn't know how to talk English and told me no and told me no I couldn't use the restroom. And the little guy in the front was rude with her trying to walk away from me while I'm talking . Use the bathroom before coming here because if not you have to pee before using a bathroom ridiculous acting like middle-class people in a big city like this . Unprofessional I will make sure none of my people come and eat here", "author": "Amalyn C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-25", "description": "I assume this restaurant only gets traffic from first timers. I will never go back. Everything tasted like it was frozen for a while then reheated. I had the shrimp linguini...not good. My girlfriend ordered the cheese ravioli. The cheese inside was dry. She ate one and couldn't eat anymore. The bread they brought us was cold and hard and served in a gross looking yellow basket. \nWe didn't want to stand in line at the pizza places nearby, but once we took a bite, we wished we had.", "author": "Shelby H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-31", "description": "Definitely go here if you have loads of spare cash and calories to waste.

Would not recommend. We were seated right next to the dessert fridge so had to contend with waiters constantly reaching over me to access desserts, without saying excuse me and barely mumbling an apology each time. Service was fast but perfunctory. There food was fine - not worth the price as it was nothing special - and the wine was bland. Such a shame we didn't do more research for our last night in NYC.", "author": "Chanelle C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-05", "description": "My husband and I were starving that we just ended up coming in here since all other restaurants were packed on a sunday afternoon - i guess being not crowded is already saying something. The service was really awful. My husband ordered a steak but it really tasted like pork (is it possible?); instead of being courteous, the waiter insisted its beef and just left us. After that, he never went back to check on us and just put our check on our table. I had to ask another waiter to take care of our bill. Whether its really my husband's mistake or not, the service should have been better than that.", "author": "Mara O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-03", "description": "Beautiful looking restaurant and great food!

Waitress was rude.  She forgot about our order and didn't apologize.  I ordered a walnut and avocado salad.  There weren't enough walnut pieces in the salad to make even one walnut.  There were two measly (and not fresh) slices of avocado.  When I told one of the waiters about this, he told the manager, who did nothing.  You would think that they would have at least offered me more walnuts and avocado.

We had the linguini which was good, but the service was horrible. Besides the older gentlemen ( no offense ) with freckles, he was nice and was the only one who attended to us besides the busser. The hostess wasn't as pleasant or inviting. A baby spider was on my plate. My friend asked for a refill on her coke and a fork because her daughter dropped it but those both never happened, so she ended up grabbing a fork from another table. Not once were we asked if we were doing ok or if we needed anything else. You would think that a restaurant right at a prime location that probably caters to many tourist would step their game up but maybe they were having an off day so that was.....Um.... FAIL!!! Great outdoor seating on a nice day, but do not expect to get any good, great, or even mediocre service cause this isn't the place for it.", "author": "Theresa M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-11", "description": "Do NOT go in there! Waiter was nice but that was it it. We had a grilled steak. We got it with fries, ketchup and one piece of broccoli and carrot. The steak was dry and so was the hole  dish.

The staff was quite friendly and the food was good - it was nice and filling.  The only reasons I didn't rate it higher was that the water wasn't cold enough and it seemed like the AC couldn't keep up with the restaurant, it was rather warm and stuffy inside the restaurant.
