That oven throws out a lot of heat, the pizza arrived steaming and the tomato sauce bubbling. I added just sausage which had the distinctive aniseed flavour that some lack. The basics are all there, good crispy base, intense sauce spread in good proportion and mozzarella that retains it's flavour. Just don't try getting a photo of that famous oven, they really don't like it.

It was the longest wait for a restaurant I've ever seen in my life.\n\nSo we just ordered a pizza to go and sat on the water. The pizza took about 5-10 minutes to come out. Perfect. We would have waited an hour otherwise.\n\nAgain, fantastic pizza.

It's kind of inconvenient for there to be one line only, for take outs and dining in.  After waiting 20 minutes, the line was still hardly moving, my boyfriend and I decided to return on a weekday instead. We came back for his birthday on a Wednesday afternoon and there was no line at all! We ordered a small 16'' pie with mushrooms and sausage and it was more than enough for two people. Their ingredients are fresh, thin crust, but our pie got a little watery from the mushrooms? Maybe next time we'll try mixing different toppings. I'm not sure if I would have left satisfied if we had to wait more than an hour for their pizza. Overall, I do look forward in going back to try different toppings and enjoying the view under the Brooklyn bridge.", "author": "Wen L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-29", "description": "Waited for an hour and halfI am not a pizza person but this is very nice.

However after that one experience you may or may not want to go back.  I am part of the latter group.\n\nI've eaten pizza at many places in NYC, and though I agree that the pizza is really good, I just felt uncomfortable there.  Therefore, the 3 star rating is all based on my opinion.\n\nFirst off, the location is nice, just walk towards the river and you get a nice view of the downtown area + brooklyn bridge at night.  It's also close to the subway, so somewhat easy access.\n\nThe gripe I have with grimaldi's is the overall experience.  The wait is long, and when you finally get a table, you're sitting in the middle of a long table shared with 2-3 other parties.  The decor is bleh (though I understand it's not trying to be fancy).  I think it has to be nice or a straight up hole in the wall... anything in between has no personality.\n\nThere is practically no interaction with the servers who seem lifeless and bored.  The menu is simple however, and it is cheaper than Lombardi's or DiFara's.\n\nIf I'm with friends who want to go to Grimaldi's then I'd gladly tag along, but if I'm the one making the decisions then I'd probably choose somewhere else.", "author": "Derrick D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-28", "description": "Ok pizza, but totally overrated.

I had to try it, especially with all the hype it gets. I had eaten at Lombardi's not too long ago, so I think this is a pretty fair comparison. Me, Jon, Peter and Bob went on a Sunday night (1/31/10). We were seated right away. \n\nThe pie we got was sausage and mushrooms. The crust here is definitely better than Lombardi's. I can't explain why, but it was a noticeable difference.The cheese and sauce were comparable between the two restaurants. Both were definitely a notch above your avg pizza joint. The sausage here had a questionable seasoning to it. I first thought the sauce tasted weird but after a quick round-table discussion, we all agreed the sausage was to blame. It wasn't spoiled or anything, but it definitely had a different taste than what I was normally used to. For some reason there were a few basil leaves on our pizza??? I didn't care for it at all, and it left a \"basil like\" taste in my mouth. Yuck. \n\nIMHO, this pizza is better than Lombardi's. I'm a crust kind of guy, and this place won out. The only reason I will probably stick to Lombardi's is because this place is a huge hassle to get to and the tables are really close together (really uncomfy if it's crowded). TYRA BANKS did come in and eat while my crew was there. ~*swoon*~ If it's good enough for her, it's good enough for me.", "author": "Matthew L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-03", "description": "Best pizza I've ever had hands down.  And I've eaten ALOT of pizza in my day.

Their jalepeno peppers are really spicy but good! The wait to get in was a long line but moved very quickly. One thing I have to say is the service can work on their attitude. They are always in a rush to get people out. I understand that they have people waiting and are very busy. But the service here is the type that relies on their \"great pizzas\" for their tips. I'd recommend them to pay a little more attention to their tables. My server didn't ask us once how our pizza is or if we need anything. He dropped the check before asking if we want dessert or anything else.", "author": "Tina M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-02", "description": "I am a pizza fiend and I have eaten slices all up and down the west coast, on the east coast from NYC to south beach and everywhere in between. I have been to the Grimaldi's on Front street in Brooklyn and the location in Phoenix Arizona. It is absolutely just the best pizza I have ever eaten. From cheese to toppings to crust everything comes together really well and I've finished their pizzas feeling full, satisfied, and wanting more. Yes the line when we walked up was a good 30 people deep but we simply placed an order over the phone, walked in 15 minutes later, picked up the pizza and walked a block down to a small park and we ate the whole pie on a bench looking at the Brooklyn Bridge.

The line is ridiculously long and even once you get seated you will wait ages for sub-par food.

The line wasn't bad and we were able to get in on the first seating.  We sat upstairs and our server was terrible and the pizza was worse.  The server had an attitude and the pizza was black on the bottom and I don't mean a little black... I mean totally black.  What a waste of time and money.  It's amazing how  a good reputation can live on for years when clearly Grimaldi's has outlived it.  We were out of town guests who will never go back!!  Just so you know...
