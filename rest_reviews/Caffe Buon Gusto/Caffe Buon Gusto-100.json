When I walked in, I didn't know there was a host because he was on the phone sitting on a bar. He seated me while still on the phone...so that was weird. My basket of bread consisted of rosemary bread and pieces of old pizza. Also weird. The crab ravioli was acceptable. Crab was fresh and sauce was average.", "author": "Melane M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-13", "description": "I love Caffe Buon Gusto's food and order it fairly often. However, they get at least one out of every three orders wrong, either sending the wrong thing or forgetting items entirely. We have called many times to get a refund, exchange an item, or try to recover something they forgot to give us, and are rarely successful. All in all, it's good food, but don't get too attached to your order.", "author": "Amanda M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-16", "description": "Impressively bad.  My friend and I, who both have worked as waiters, had planned a relaxing brunch in the sunshine, were left gobsmacked by how these folks managed to mess up our time there. Our Australian waiter was impatient and rude. Then after lowering himself to take our order, we didnt see him again for the ENTIRE meal. Impressive. The hostess started clearing our bread and olive oil while we were still eating. On her third attempt I pointed out that I still had a knife and fork in my hand, so she finally took the hint. The food was average, considering the price.    We went to nearby Armandos Italian restaurant for a glass of wine to get away from Buon Gusto, and received a warm welcome and courteous service.

Whatever you do, do not get the pumpkin ravioli. It was super sweet, like a dessert. My friend enjoyed her eggplant dish though.

Calamari was almost flavorless. Chicken parm's was cheesy, but the sauce tasted like just plain ripe tomatoes without any seasoning and the chicken wasn't even crispy. Everything needed pepper, but it didn't seem to help. Tiramisu was good and fluffly, but almost felt like they didn't use the raw cocoa powder on top, which made it bland too. I would call it Caffe Bland Gusto.", "author": "Corey M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-16", "description": "Wonderful restaurant. \n\nI called beforehand to make sure I could bring my puppy with me as long as we sat in the outdoor seating area. They said absolutely--they couldn't wait to see me. \n\nI arrived for my reservation (I didn't really need one, but they gave me one anyway so I would have an outdoor table) early, and they greeted me by name and exclaimed over my puppy. My waitress Alice sat me at a corner table and immediately brought over a water bowl for my baby and a glass of water for me, and fussed over my little guy.\n\nLong story short: service was wonderful, food was delicious, and I will be going back!\n\nOh, and get the lasagne--absolutely AH-mazing!

I've dined in here before and it was so so. I would return. But after placing a delivery order, I have never wanted to scream at someone so badly and will NEVER eat here or order delivery again. After placing a delivery order 45 minutes later (expected) my order came and was wrong. Completely wrong. Wrong sauce - added meat (and I'm a vegetarian). Double checked my order and I placed it correctly. Called the restaurant to which the bartender could not find the manager so was going to put me on the phone with a buss boy (I don't know why) until I said I will till she found a manager. Then I spoke to a manager who didn't understand a word I said. Literally repeated my address five times. Then surprisingly the same delivery boy shows up (over an hour  after I've placed my order)....has no idea what orders he currently has in his hands...tries to hand me off someone else's order...doesn't even have my order in one of his bags...then I call the restaurant back...the manager claims someone is on their way...I tell him I'm extremely frustrated (which is takes a lot for me to complain or even leave a review!!!) and I tell him this is ridiculous and I expect a refund or something to be compensated for this...to which he then HANGS UP ON ME!!!!\n\nI work in the service bizz too and I expect things to go wrong or take a while...but if you're not nice and don't give respect to your customers...let alone hang up on them!! How are you a manager?!? Still have not received my food......and now I'm afraid to eat it in fear they will spit in it!!!!\n\nWORST delivery experience in my life. RIDICULOUS!\n\n\nNow an hour and half later my food finally shows up....and nothing. No refund. Zip.

Food has always been great and is still on point. The problem is the prices are crazy and portions have been reduced to almost tapas size. My major gripe is the pasta dishes and this will always get me when we all know that a pound of pasta for the average consumer could be under $1. So a restaurant buying in bulk is probably getting for half that and giving you a fraction of the pound and charging as much as they do is a bit ridiculous. The deserts are also great, but also have become bite-size.", "author": "John D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-09", "description": "Not certain on the food but the bar is nice and the staff (this is important to me) is super!

Heres a tip when u have a large group you may want to keep pitchers of water on the table especially when you refused to give us new glasses. We had a preset menu 3 courses apps, entree and desert. We brought a cake so i guess they thought we didnt get the desert we paid for. Never served it and started a bar tab rather then have the guests pay for there own drinks like we had told them leaving the poor woman who put the party together to pay the extra $$$$. The seating was a nightmare all in itself. Party of our party was on the opposite side of the restaurant by themselves. If you cant accommodate our requests do not take the party. The waitresses were cold and unpleasant and seriously should not be working in this industry !!!!!", "author": "Nicole M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-17", "description": "Unfortunately this is Pretty subpar Italian food.

I forgot what I put in it. Goat cheese, a meat and a veggie I believe. It was delicious. \n\nThey have pretty good drinks too. The atmosphere of the place is great.

This is real, old school Italian. White table cloths, Frank Sinatra and Louis Prima crooning through the speakers and the entire staff speaks with different lovely accents. I'm hooked on the breadbasket which has three types of bread (soft, crusty, tomato-y) and the EVOO for dipping makes it all taste magical. The lobster ravioli is divine. Crab cake appetizers are good, not scrumptious but still nice to have on the table as a starter. Tonight I ate the Pagla e Fieno shrimp. I asked the waitress to have the chef kick it up a notch. He did so with perfection and my shrimps were also big and cooked just right. I could've used just a bit more pasta to soak up all the spicy, red sauce but this is not a complaint because I like my pasta saucy! Please note that Caffe Buon Gusto is authentic Italian cooking, so the pasta is extremely al dente. It is in fact so al dente, that you can almost feel it crunch between your teeth. If crunchy pasta is not your thing, pass that info to your server and the chef will prepare it to your liking. I didn't have any room for dessert tonight but I have had the Tiramisu on another occasion and it's very good. There's a bar at the front  where a few of the after work crowd in suits, watches sports. There's also a brunch menu I'd like to explore.", "author": "Tanya R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-07", "description": "The pear and gargonzolo salad, and the Prosciutto with melon were both divine. \n\nThe charming man who I presumed was the owner is old school charming and suave.
