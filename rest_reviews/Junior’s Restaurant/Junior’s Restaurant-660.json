Ordered fried catfish, burger (dnt recall which 1), and fried chicken with turnips, mashed n gravy n rolls.  Food was horrible, no seasoning at all.   The rolls had poppy seeds or sesame seeds or something on them, yuck.  \nVery expensive for horrible food.\nIf you dnt need any seasoning or flavor to your food, definitely go to juniors.", "author": "L J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-01", "description": "The cheesecake was to die for!

In addition to amazing dessert. Was surprised at the high quality of their grilled chicken sandwich which was served on wonderful challah bread. The fries and sweet potato fries were crispy.. Yum! \n\nThey put out pickles, coleslaw and beets on your table- awesome touch!!!!\n\nAnd the rumors are true :-) their desserts are amazing. The plain cheese cake is perfect and if you want some added sweetness go for the strawberry cheesecake pie (pie has the graham cracker crust).", "author": "Dara B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-04-05", "description": "Great Cakes and Pies and tasty brownies. \nThe only issue In have with Jr's is the staff. \nThey are always very rude and curt. \nI really go out of my way and try to be very polite and courteous to anyone that serves me--since I'm a flight attendant myself and I  understand how dealing with the public can be a challenge. \nI have to wonder if the staff perhaps is not treated well by management and maybe that is why the customer service is subpar.", "author": "Dexter C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-22", "description": "If you're doing Brooklyn, you have to do Juniors. Its the historic diner restaurant of Brooklyn with famous cheesecake. You can feel the years of this place in all the good ways. I enjoyed my over cooked burger and fries. It wasn't cheap, but it tasted good and I could spread my legs at the table and soak in the view. The grilled cheese was also good. The cheesecake wonderful.

If you walk away hungry that is on you! You get a pastry tray with your meal which has cute bite sized pastries and rolls with it. Then your meal alone is huge!

I grew up in Brooklyn and this used to be one of my favorite restaurants.... Today the service was terrible the waiter was extremely slow it took 15 minutes to get our starters and an extra 25 minutes to order.  It was not busy.  The food was not hot just warm.  The best part was the mimosa which took 20 minutes to get and the cherry Pepsi which is my absolute favorite.  Juniors you guys are losing your touch and the lunch special is not available on weekends so paying full price for terrible service and mediocre food pissed me off. I guess I'll be back when you guys step it back up", "author": "Brittney W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "Juniors is a delightful trip back in time. The service was speedy, the breakfast was tasty and the cheesecake. Ooo the cheesecake. \n\nA lot of NYC staples are overrated, but juniors cheesecake lives up to the hype. If you are going to make the trip to Juniors you also need to Brooklyn. My only ding was the price.  The large cheesecake is $35! Now I've paid more and I didn't feel ripped off, but yikes $35 for a cheesecake.", "author": "Charles L."}], "servesCuisine": "Diners", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Junior\u2019s Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "386 Flatbush Ave", "postalCode": "11238", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/51GkmfCs08QabOoqYMegYg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188525257"}
