I had the shrimp and avocado crepe, and it was definitely not worth $10. It had maybe two pieces of shrimp and three slices of avocado and I was not full at all, although it did taste pretty good.

Another distinguishing factor is that their crepes are served in a hand-rolled cone shape, which has its merits...and flaws.  \n\nBy rolling up the crepe, you get a nice wide, cross-sectional view of what's inside, and every creation looks delicious.  It's also handier to eat, because you can hold it in your hands and walk around taking bites without making too much of a mess...there are also no tables in the shop for you to fork and knife it.  \n\nThere are some negatives to this, however.   Because the pancake wrap is made first, then laid out to put the toppings on, by the time it gets to your hands, it is already cold.   Which is a shame, because they truly do look beautiful, and a clear effort is made.  Another minor problem is gravity.  Any crepe you order with sauce, ice cream, chocolate, or anything liquid (basically all of them), will have a disproportional concentration of it end up in your final three bites because it all drips to the bottom.  \n\nThe ingredients used here are general of solid quality, and very fresh.  The menu is well thought out, and the toppings and flavors in each crepe is well-balanced and tasty.  However good, I just can't enjoy a cold crepe that much.  Unfortunately the feature sets  Eight Turn Crepe apart also is the cause of its biggest flaw.", "author": "Dennis L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-02", "description": "This place just opened, and it was pretty crowded when I went today around 5:30pm. It's a small space and there's not much room inside so most people were waiting for their crepes outside. I got the azuki crepe with matcha custard, azuki beans, strawberries, and green tea gelato from il lab. They made my crepe pretty quickly and you can smell the scents of vanilla from the crepe batter wafting around while you wait. While the concept of hand-held crepes isn't that groundbreaking, the best part about these crepes are the whipped yogurt cream. It's light and tangy and goes perfectly with the fruit! The crepe itself is soft and chewy though because it's all wrapped up, so it might be different from the regular crispy crepes that you are used to.", "author": "Michelle H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-21", "description": "This place has an awesome selection of cr\u00eapes, all very creative and different from you would see in a normal cr\u00eape.

It was truly delicious. A bit difficult to eat (I definitely wouldn't recommend attempting to eat it on the go), but well worth the messiness. I can't wait to go back and try one of the dessert crepes (I would've gotten one this time, but I didn't think I could down it all on my own and my friend was too full to split one).

I had the harajuku fruit cocktail. Light and not stingy with the filling ingredients like some othe crepe places. Easy to eat and ingredients are well distributed till the bottom. However it takes a while to make one. I went by at lunch time around 1 pm. A girl in front of me ordered 4 to go.

Tried the eight lox, BLT and Azuki berries crepes. Soooo good!

I got there around 6ish , it was cold and getting dark so I didn't have to  wait long for my crepe. I ordered a turkey delight , originally wanted to try the strawberry with match ice cream and red bean crepe , but i was cold and hungry from all the walking and shopping around the area . You know how you get all excited and your mouth gets all watery from watching them make the crepe but when you take the first bite and it didn't live up to your expectation ? Well, that was me . My face went from :) to :( . The crepe was cold ... I was like huh ? I never had a cold savory crepe anywhere , I was so disappointed. I would come back again to give the sweet crepe a try , because i cant resist their cute looks.
