I should have known better.  Rather, I should have known better and warned my fiance about what I was dragging him into.\n\nIt was a late night of babysitting and I was STARVING.  When midnight rolled around I was freed, but I was experiencing my worst nightmare: I wanted food.  Greasy food.  I wanted it NOW.  BUT IT'S MIDNIGHT AND WHERE WILL I GET GREASY FOOD AT MIDNIGHT IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD? (yes, I was quite dramatic at the time).\n\nA quick google for neighborhood 24 hour diners led me to the yelp page.  Multiple reviewers complained of food poisoning.  In my weakened hunger-induced state, I accepted this risk, and had my fiance meet me here.\n\nI ordered a bacon cheeseburger and strawberry milkshake.  After checking the bun for mold, all was clear and I chomped down.  No problems there.\n\nMy fiance, however, ordered cherry pie.  CHERRY PIE.  He commented that it tasted kind of strange, but ate it all.  The next day wasn't pretty for him.  \n\nTo make matters worse, I hadn't warned him about the reviews I read.  I held back, because he was ordering cherry pie, after all.  Who gets food poisoning from cherry pie? I was the one who should have worried.  There are so many ways a bacon cheeseburger can go wrong.  But cherry pie?\n\nI am an awful girlfriend.

Food was fine but I didn't get my drink and when I called they said they would send it. Three hours later I called again wondering where it was and they said the driver went home. So I asked well then I'm not getting what I paid for? And they said they would send it in the morning. I very much doubt it! The food was fine but the service was terrible! They even gave me attitude when I called the first time, like it was my fault. They are just terrible and I will never use them again!

We ended up trying Happy Days, figuring that it's \"just a diner\" and couldn't vary too much from any other we'd passed. \n\nOh, how wrong we were. The place is a little bit grim inside, and even though it wasn't all that busy, service wasn't too attentive. After browsing the large menu, we ordered our food. I believe I had a massive omelet, and I'm not 100% sure what my girlfriend ordered, but I do remember the both of us getting sick not too long after. It didn't taste bad when we tried the food, but the frequent bathroom trips that followed the meal were a sure sign that something was up.\n\nMost memorable moment of the meal? A very, very (VERY) large man stomping into the establishment, plopping himself down, and shouting at the top of his lungs \"TWO CHEESEBURGERS! NO FRIES!\" and then breathing heavily while sopping up all his body leakage with a cloth. The waiter then called him gordo under his breath. Food that makes you ill and a patron that makes you sick. Not a good combo. \n\nHonestly, that man, weak juice, and and a need for pepto are all I could remember about this place. With all the places along Montague to choose from,  please spare yourself the trouble and try another option.", "author": "DeShaun C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-13", "description": "Here's the thing:  I've been in this neighborhood for ten plus years.  I try not to order out, there isn't really that much, but it's two in the morning, you need something to eat, what are you going to do?  The guys are surly, I don't call over there anymore, I order online.  What's worse, and mark this, the last several times I've ordered I've found hairs in my entr\u00e9e!  There's no way to prove intent but I think it was done deliberately.  I tip about three bucks and there five blocks away, which I think is fair.  If it come to late night and I really need something I go Carrol Gardens Classic Diner.  Yes it's more expensive, but at least I'm not finding P--- hairs in my hashbrowns.

Where's Fonzy when you need him to fix things?\n\nAlthough the staff was friendly, the food was quite pitiful. I had a burger and fries that I had to work quite hard at eating (it was that bad).

Chocolate milk has two ingredients, so if a place can't make it, there's a problem.  Happy Days cannot make chocolate milk.  My milk was so warm I had to fish the ice out of my water to get it to a drinkable temperature, and I'm pretty sure the waiter (or whoever made it) used like an entire bottle of chocolate syrup but neglected to mix it up.  The glass looked like a black-and-white cookie lying on its side.\n\nThe rest of the food was okay, but not great and felt kind of greasy and sub-standard (and I lived in Jersey for six years -- I know from diners).
