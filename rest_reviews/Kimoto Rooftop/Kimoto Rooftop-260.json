Such a hidden gem in the area considering there are only a handful of rooftops in Brooklyn. We were too early to make the happy hour which starts at 4 pm but the deals looked good. There was a decent food menu, plenty of seating to lounge around, and a stunning view!

As we entered, we saw the place was loud but the songs the DJ was playing and their signature cocktails didn't make us feel that way. The food was good and definitely it wasn't expensive at all.

I've been here twice and I've enjoyed myself each time. It's never overly crowded but if you get here too late, you won't be able to get a seat outside. You can see the Statue of Liberty off in a distance and the city skyline. I feel like this place might be a hidden gem since it is on a rooftop, but all the better. I'm definitely making this my go to place, especially during the summer!!", "author": "Y.

Yes, please. The space is nice and the seating wraps around so you get to view Brooklyn from tons of angles. Hopefully the get some heaters for the chilly fall weather. \n\nThe drink here are the star (as they should be at a rooftop bar). I had the Peat's Revenge and my fianc\u00e9 had the No Sleep Till... The Peat's revenge was smoky with a hint of citrus and it was lighter than I expected but still good. The No Sleep Till... was a lychee cocktail, it was fruity but not too sweet and tasted a little like grapefruit. There were several other cocktails and lots of interesting beers that we try when we come back. \n\nFor food we tried the bresaola summer roll, disco fries, and pork sliders. The summer roll tasted like a cold it sandwich in a summer roll form, it would be good if you were into that sort of thing. The disco fries were good, covered in brisket, cheese, peppers and sriracha. The fries themselves were great too so if you just got a side of fries I'm sure it would be awesome. The pork sliders were a bit on the sweet and the peppers were a nice addition. Overall, the food we had was ok. There were several other items on the menu that could have been better. \n\nThe real reason to come here would be to have some great drinks in awesome downtown Brooklyn setting.", "author": "Mike C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-28", "description": "Love love Love this place. Came here on a recommendation by a friend who I must say will never send me to a spot that was not on point. I must say it's chill and definitely on point if ur looking for a chill night with some good drinks.  Can't really eat the food cuz I'm kosher but I'm sure it's delicious. But the drinks r fabulous. Didn't really remember the bartenders name but the boy do they mix a drink. Definitely will b coming back especially on a Wednesday to try out the cigar night.", "author": "Robert A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "Really cute place . EXCELLENT FOOD!!! The service could have been better but I would definitely go back . Went for 4th of July , was able to see some fire works from far but nothing special . The music was on point . They had hookah and I loved their strawberry mojitos . I bought the open bar through Pulsd, it was worth it . My favorite were the Parmesan fries ! I LOVED THEM ! Cute place in downtown Bk.

I must say the only thing saving them is the view. The service at Kimoto is SUBPAR at best. On my visit here the waitress did not only take long to take our orders, but she never returned. When I approached her for another drink she never returned. After 30 minutes of no service, I practically had to walk to the bar and order a drink for my table. When I asked another waitress for assistance, the inexperienced waitress told me that my waitress was busy servicing  other parties. Half the place was empty which I could not understand why she was so busy. I've worked in the service industry before so I know the difference between good and bad service. The service here isn't just bad, and horrible isn't enough to describe to blatant lack of service or discrimination here at kimoto. Good luck to all if you  ever have the opportunity to visit be AWARE!!!!.", "author": "Cindy P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-20", "description": "Pretty nice looking rooftop bar/restaurant in the middle of brooklyn. We ordered multiple dishes including, kobe beef burger, eggs benedict, and chicken waffles. For sides, we ordered french fries. The food was exceptional, nothing amazing. Everything but the eggs benedict was only average. I couldn't help but to keep stealing off my girlfriend's dish. The service was really poor, that's a shame. We order fries for sides and it came 40min after we finished our meal, not to forget the edamame that we ordered never came. Our server was nice enough to give us the fries on him though. I'm not sure exactly why this place is so unorganized but it definitely can be a better place if everything was prompt with the okay food the serve.", "author": "Dennis K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "This place has a nice atmosphere.

The bar had interesting decor - more stylish over comfortable, but not bad. It felt spacious since it was kind of empty around 10pm on a Wednesday. We ordered a bottle of prosecco, and service was fast. It was too cold to sit in the covered area, even with the heaters, and I felt a weird drop on my shoulder fall from who knows what (the ceiling is covered too). It was even colder on the roof so we didn't get a chance to enjoy the views. The rooftop isn't bad, next time I want to go out in Brooklyn maybe I'll come back, but there are better rooftops in Manhattan.", "author": "Akhila R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-07", "description": "great place to visit with e.g. teenagers, for the view, music and food.

(a friend told us the sushi was really good though) -- also this place is part of a hotel which we didn't know. I guess that's why the food is bad-- tourists don't know good new york food. Oh well.

No view at all. If you are used to rooftop bars in Manhattan like me, don't waste your tin coming here if you are looking for a nice rooftop.\n\nThe only nice thing is that there are quite many Asian hot girls, if that's your thing.
