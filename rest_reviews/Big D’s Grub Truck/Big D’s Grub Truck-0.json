I saw them on Monday, but for up-to-date schedules, check the bottom of their homepage: http://bigdsgrub.com/\n\nFor their Manhattan reviews: https://www.yelp.com/biz/big-ds-khao-cart-new-york\n\nAnyway, I had no idea there were multiple variations of Big D's Grub, but their second truck (dubbed D2) features their \"Khao\" menu, which is Vietnamese-inspired Asian fusion (rice and noodle bowls, mostly).\n\nI had the chicken thighs over dirty rice. At $11, it was a ton of food. Stuffed to the brim of the container. The sweet chilli sauce was pretty standard grocery store stuff, but the chicken was tender and marinated well. Also came with a side of Asian slaw (the kind that comes on a banh mi).\n\nI also had the pork and chive dumplings, which were freshly pan fried. It took a little bit of time to make, but totally worth it. Especially at $3 for four dumplings.\n\nWould definitely return to try their other meat dishes, though they definitely have vegetarian and vegan friendly options.", "author": "Kenny C."}], "servesCuisine": "Asian Fusion", "priceRange": null, "name": "Big D\u2019s Grub Truck", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3-dHOa0nhj7kmSbmdOJwKg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": ""}
