The service was so so.\nFor those yelpers and readers that are wondering why it's called pequena, it's because it's a small spot and you are literally sitting arm and arm with the next person beside you.  I don't know if this was to create a more intimate feel or this restaurant is trying to maximize their space. \n\nMy meals was a bit pricy for 3 tacos that fell apart easily. \n\nI don't think i'd come back here for a few reason.  1. space, 2. staff friendliness 3. space.", "author": "Sha T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-23", "description": "Food is pretty good for price and portion but my god get yourself a better waitstaff.

(Including the tasty $5 maragitas.). Food stays closer to authentic Mexican than most, which stands to reason when you peek into the kitchen.  The empanadas are great.  The server will ask you whether you want red or green sauce, or why not try a \"little bit of both?\"\n\nThe sides that accompany the dishes--rice, beans, guac, pico--are well seasoned on their own but can take a couple dashes of cholula.  \n\nThe decor is outrageous.  I found myself snapping close ups of all the weird Mexican folk art.  A 5 year old would probably have a ball in this place.

A burrito. And it was so delicious that I made a mental note that great burritos can be found in NYC. Then I lived in Long Island, followed by Hoboken. Sadly, I have not had a great burrito since. So I wrote my friend in Baltimore to help me figure out where it was she lead me to with the great burritos. It was here, in Fort Greene, we had bday drinks nearby and I stopped here after. The food was too good to be true: I had only had Mexican food THAT good in California, Arizona, Mexico (and surprisingly, yes, Chicago). I loved the vibe as well and decor.

It is fresh and flavorful. But the ambience really varies: today was a drag. A hot Sunday afternoon and I looked forward to relaxing. My young waitress was friendly but too laid back: most of the time I was there she was hanging out with her buddies, sitting on a stool between them, as if they were all out for lunch together. Combine that with a too loud soundtrack of a recent college grad's favorites, and my pleasant meal was basically ruined. Too bad...last time I was there the soundtrack was 60's hits!

Stopped in on a whim with a friend during brunch. I had a mushroom quesadilla and she had some sort of egg bake- both were really fresh and yummy. Service was attentive. The bill for two (no adult beverages ordered) was under $25 including tax which is a really good price for generally overpriced Brooklyn brunch.

They're distinct, very flavorful, some of the best I've ever had. Try the mushroom and the plantain. You can get both in a platter.

The Vanderbilt location has a lot more room inside, but the food isn't as good as Fort Greene.

Your rice isn't the same. Now it's really bland and pale. Your chicken quesadilla wasn't crispy enough and failed to wow me.
