We were hungry for Italian afterward and I had Yelp'd this place, which had really good reviews.\n\nWe were looking for authentic Brooklyn pizza and so that's what we ordered. It was a thin-crust pizza with sausage. Very good!\n\nThey also provided a complementary basket of Italian bread with dipping oil. Really good bread. Fresh and delicious.\n\nI love dessert with my meals, and I'm never shy to order. It was a good way to end the meal (see attached pics).\n\nThe interior was warm and inviting, and the service was really fantastic and friendly. This is a nice theme. I think, often times, the perception is that New York service is rude and impersonal, but I continue to find examples to the contrary time and time again.\n\nThis was near where we stayed ... a block off of Flatbush Ave. and in the heart of downtown Brooklyn. I would strongly recommend stopping by. We had a great experience and really good pizza.", "author": "Greg B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-23", "description": "I tried Forno Rosso when visiting Brooklyn a year ago and was impressed. The lasagna was excellent. I've been back on subsequent trips and it has been just as good. The pasta is cooked to perfection and the wood fired pizzas are excellent as well. \nOne of the best Italian restaurants in NY with reasonable prices and good service.

I'm not a foodie, but I have to write that their food is really delicious and has a refined way of flavors and presentations. Their kale salad with salmon are amazing. My coworker brought me here while we're we're working in the area. We ordered a group lunch to go when we returned for over 12 people. We have no photos to post because everyone (gluten free, lactose free, vegan, no food issues) ALL are their lunches before we could take pretty photos. The service is polite and genuine. Their staff is friendly and helpful. The restaurant is spacious and open. It's location is close and a little difficult with GPS ride shares, but that's not a biggie.\nThe brick oven pizza is sooo good - the crust is crispy but not rough and the sauce is delicious and enough. The desserts are homemade too and there were no leftovers.\nThank you for the great menu, service and prices. It's amenable to ordering online in advance too.", "author": "J H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-09", "description": "I'm really confused here. I absolutely adore the food and happy hour menu. First time I came here, service was amazing (as was the food). Should have worn fat pants for all the bruschetta, truffle pizza and wine. It was like I had an adopted Italian grandma who hung out with Nigella Lawson, and was like, \"Of course you can get chubby and sloppy drunk tonight!\" \nThen, however, comes the second visit with the man friend (who is familiar with the whole hot mess part). We were seated immediately, and I was thrilled to talk about my day with him. FOR TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES. I wanted to suggest that the restaurant use text messaging between the patrons and their waitstaff. For the entire evening, it felt as if we had to light a fire under someone's ass in order to get attention, and even then, we'd often had to do it twice. If there was any recalcitrance, I'd be more forgiving, but there wasn't. It's sad, because, this place could be a really great go-to for neighborhood couples like us, but I'm not sure if we're willing to put in the effort for a place that doesn't seem interested.", "author": "Shana S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "ALERT ALL CUSTOMERS! Do not order delivery pizza from here!!!!!!!!! DO NOT! \n\n\nI was delivered the wrong pizza and it was cold. I called the restaurant DIRECTLY and was told by a woman at the restaurant that a new pizza would be made free of charge. I get a call 1 hr later telling me that the new pizza is almost here. I wait 30 mins, no pizza. I call the restaurant again to check in. They tell me that I'm wrong, no pizza was re-ordered for me, and that it was the delivery driver's problem not theirs. I then explained the situation again, they interrupted me and said that is not what happened and that I actually was talking to the delivery person before (which is impossible because I called the business' number directly when this happened).

It is a GEM! The reviews are all spot on - very cute place (bigger than I expected) with just really awesome food. I've been for both brunch and dinner. For brunch, we came in at around 1 on a Sunday and were able to sit right away. The complimentary bread is phenomenal - the oil specifically - it's so flavorful. I actually thought there were capers in the oil, but turns out it was lentils! My mom and I (who are HUGE eggplant parm fans), split that for an app. It was among the best we've ever had. If you have a great red sauce, it makes all the difference and Forno Rosso absolutely does. We then split a margherita pizza. On a good day, I could eat one all by myself (it's a larger personal size), but we split it and that worked perfectly. When I came for dinner I had the bolognese just to get a taste of the red sauce once again. For me, there was a bit too much meat and not enough pasta, but still good. My boyfriend got the shrimp tagliolini which was a serious highlight - definitely something I'd consider getting next time, which I hope is soon.", "author": "Ali C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "This place use to be ok but ever since they installed an obnoxious speaker outside their restaurant sending noise pollution out into the street I just can't bring myself to eat there anymore.

The food here is consistently good which is why we've come back. The problem is every time we come here it feels like we are being rushed. \n\nDuring our last visit a week ago we arrived in time for happy hour. We ordered the oriechette pasta with eggplant and ricotta, meatballs, papardelle with mushrooms, and two glasses of wine. They also serve complimentary bread with the meal which is absolutely delicious. It comes with lentils to spread on it which tastes heavenly.  Before we were even finished with the bread less than 10 minutes after it was brought to us, a server asked us if she could take the bread basket, when there was still bread left that we wanted to have the rest of our meal. So I said we're not done and pointed to the bread that was left in the basket. She seemed highly confused. Our food came out in under 3 minutes which was also baffling. Yes, we were hungry but why was everything happening so fast? What was the rush? The restaurant wasn't even halfway filled.  The food is good and the price is right which is why we've come back.\n\nMy husband and I always take our time and order a few rounds of drinks, and even dessert when we go out to eat. A typical dining experience takes about 2 hours. We were in and out of this place in under an hour.  Wam bam thank you ma'am. \n\nI hope they fix this issue because it really makes for an unpleasant and uncomfortable dining experience.", "author": "shana l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-03", "description": "I must say the server was amazing extremely friendly very helpful in making my decision truffle pizza was really good for one of my favorites was veal tortellini.

The best app was the bruschetta. It was loaded with a bunch of tomatoes on a nice wedge of bread. The FRIED shishitto peppers not the best way to prepare these delicious peppers. The squid was def very tender but had me begging for salt and pepper. My daughters friend got her pasta dish to bring home. My daughter seemed to enjoy her dish orecchiette. The squid ink pasta was good. It came with four shrimp. My boy was happy with the dish. I got a custom pizza with Brussels and some prosciutto do Parma. Not even in the same lead as mirroring. It was ok but I prefer my pizza to be able to stand up on its own a bit. This pizza fell completely flat. It was tasty enough. I can not really see myself returning.
