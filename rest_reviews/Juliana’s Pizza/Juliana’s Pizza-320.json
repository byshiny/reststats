The sauce was a little sweet, the cheese was very fresh and the crust had great coal oven flavor and was still a bit chewy which I liked a lot. \n\nOverall I highly recommend this place", "author": "Stefan H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-21", "description": "My friend and I wanted a \"special experience in Brooklyn\" therefore we choose to go to \"Juliana's Pizza\". There was a huge line. We made the line for about 30\nminutes on a Thursday afternoon. The service was good but the pizza wasn't all that great. It was tasty and the pizza was good, I just don't think that it was worth the 30 minute wait.

Love the margarita pizza, all their food tastes so fresh! Worth the wait.", "author": "Natasha M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-10", "description": "You can feel the love.\n\nI mentioned at length in my Grimaldi's Yelp review on how Grimaldi's over the years lost their touch as you can tell their quality dropping, especially once they moved to their new location to make a double decker restaurant to house more tourists (have to be honest).  Luckily the original Grimaldi's owner reopened a new restaurant at his original shop location, now with the name of Juliana's.\n\nThe immediate difference that I would be able to tell at Juliana's is the love that goes into each pizza.  You can see the pie being made in front of you and put in the oven as you wait.  At Grimaldi's something takes your order, they go away, someone new comes to serve you and has no idea who ordered what.  Julianas still has that family type environment.\n\nThe pizzas are great.  Had the #1 and #4.  Old school style, they don't let you substitute.  They want you to enjoy it the way it was intended to be made.  Though the pizza may not be as amazing as what Grimaldi's used to be 10+ years ago (at least the memory of what it used to be), it is still one of the best.  In my ranking of NYC pizzas (see below) it is currently second only to Di Faras in terms of whole pie restaurants.  You wont be disappointed, and you'll feel like you had an authentic NYC experience.  Whereas eating at Grimaldi's today, you'll feel like you're eating at a Planet Hollywood.  Well a better example might be Buca Di Peppo, but you get my point.\n\nA couple of things Julianas has over Di Faras is that it's closer to Manhattan - not just because that's where I live but because it's less of a hassle to take visitors from out of town when they visit.  The other thing is that at certain parts of the day (2pm ish) there may be no wait, whereas Di Faras there is always always a wait.\n\n\nFYI here is my own personal rating system and ranking list of some other pizza joints in NYC\n\n5=worth a trip, something you'll crave\n4=worth getting but only if you're already in the area\n3=only worth it if it's free/discounted, not worth paying full price\n2=would not even eat it if free, waste of stomach space\n1=the place should shut down\n\nThe places are listed as best/better first if they share the same rating (I.e. Di Faras better than Julianas, etc.)\n\n5's (whole pie) - Di Faras, Juliana's, Keste, Emily, L \u0026 B Spumoni\n5's (by the slice) - Artichoke, Prince St, Joes\n4's (whole pie) - Don Antonio, Robertas, Barboncino, Table 87, Lombaris, Patsys Pizzeria, Speedy Romeo\n4's (by the slice) - Roma's, Go 99, Two Brothers\n3's - Johns Pizzeria, Grimaldi's, B Side\n2's -Two Boots Pizza, Lucalis\n1's - none so far", "author": "Thomas V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-23", "description": "Coal.

A recent trip to New York thus called for some serious pizza consumption. Juliana's Pizza offers elevated options and served us some truly excellent pizza. \n\nLocated in DUMBO, Brooklyn, it's a great place to go while checking out the Brooklyn Bridge. My fianc\u00e9e noticed a long line outside of Juliana's while we explored the neighborhood, which meant it had to be good. We were able to get in just before it closed for lunch and were seated at the counter. We ordered the No. 1 special (mozzarella, scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions and white truffles in olive oil) and were definitely glad we did. (The No. 1 special doesn't have tomatoes.) Well balanced and fragrant, the pizza hit the spot for what we craved. The mozzarella and pancetta were particularly outstanding, and the scallions were the perfect compliment.  \n\nThe service could use some improvement, however. The person who seated us, while not overtly rude, was not particularly pleasant or welcoming. Also, it took us a while to get menus and for a server to take our order. Thankfully, the pizza was so good that we left glad to have checked out Juliana's.", "author": "Alex R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-07", "description": "Excellent pizza bear the brooklyn bridge! You can either wait for Grimaldi's or wait for Juliana's. The Juliana's line is shorter (although barely) and the pizza is very good. Plus they take credit cards. You can either eat at the restaurant or take your pizza to go and eat at brooklyn bridge park. If you take out, make sure you tell the person you want to order to go in order to skip the line.

Ordered the arugula salad (with walnuts and goat cheese) and margarita pizza.\n\nThe salad is a meal OR big enough for two  (maybe 3) if you are also having pizza \n\nPizzas come in sizes small (16\") and large (18\").  They do not sell is by the slice.  Since the pizza is thin crust, a small to medium sized adult  could easily eat half in a sitting. \n\nThe salad was very good and I would order it again as a meal.   The pizza was....  bland.  I had to add salt (which helped a lot) and some red pepper (which I never add to pizza).  I am wondering if I should have chosen one of the specials? \n\nThe margarita pizza would be kid- friendly pizza because the flavors are simple and it's a basically a cheese pizza without too much sauce or cheese. If I tried it again I would try a special with the sausage or prosciutto to give it some additional flavor.   I would skip the margarita pizza and try the #4.", "author": "K W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-09", "description": "We arrived at Juliana's on Monday just a few minutes after their 4P open.

Not every kid in LA gets to have pizza flown home from NY. \n\nThe best and most friendly service. I can't wait to return!\n\nI'd say, why can't LA have a Juliana's but truth be told when these places open up at home, they never taste the same as they do in NY so I'll just be happy to visit when I'm in town again next.", "author": "Candace L."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Juliana\u2019s Pizza", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "19 Old Fulton St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-zAVNXSKJDQNYZQYWbqNRA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185966700"}
