I also have to praise the Naruto rainbow roll as well, beautiful presentation with wonderful flavors. The sushi here is fantastic, the disappointment comes with the non-japanese items on the menu. We got a Thai soup that was weak in flavor, it seemed to be watered down. I would go back for the sushi, but only the sushi.", "author": "Mel N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-16", "description": "Lunch box combo is so worth it for the price ($9). Got the chicken teriyaki and it came with miso soup, 2 spring rolls, 8 pieces of California roll, vegetables, rice and fruit.

I asked the waitress if I can change it and she calls the manager, who also told me we can't change it.\n\nThen the food came after 20min, we ordered the same roll as the neighbors next table, however our rolls were significantly smaller 5 pieces instead of 8, and the actual diameter of the roll was smaller. The spicy salmon looked different from the one from next table. We were afraid the food was tampered with and did not eat it.\n\nI am extremely dissatisfied and want my money back.

The food was really good and affordable. Chicken Teriyaki lunch box $10 - soup, salad, California rolls, white rice, 2 veggie rolls. The chicken was cooked perfectly.

There's a separate menu for it. Big restaurant. Lighting is not too dark or dim or bright. There's a cool retro red OZU sign by the entrance.\n\nService was quick. Food was mediocre.\n\nDrinks: Ozu Mai thai \u0026 that martini with sake in it. Both were not too strong. Ozu Mai thai tasted like pineapple but not too fruity. The martini wasn't fruity or sweet at all.\n\nAppetizer: calamari was very uniformed. It was all the same ring sizes. Usually you would get the really small ring but it wasn't there!\n\nRegular roll: Ozu roll. Cooked salmon with onions wrapped in seaweed and rice. Not a good roll combo. The onion taste took so long to leave my taste buds.\n\nSpecial rolls: Lady Gaga roll and Out of control roll. Both pretty good. \n\nOverall it was alright. The groupon deal was worth it but otherwise not going back again.", "author": "Amy Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "Stopped in here for some sushi the other day and it was really good! The place was very clean which I find very for sushi places! The food was really good and they had a lot of options to chose from! We ended up ordering a lot of different rolls, some Japanese sodas, udon soup, salmon teriyaki, and some tuna! They were all excellent and definitely a place to go back to!

Their sushi is sold and pretty authentic Japanese style. Fishes are great for the price.  Out of all the Japanese restaurants around here, they serve the best basic sushi (Japanese style, not crazy rolls).

Their sushi pieces were the tiniest pieces l've ever seen! I went there to enjoy my lunch with my wife and all we experienced was anxiety! They forgot one of our orders!

My favorite is the spicy seafood soup, all the rolls and the two for one drink specials. You can NEVER beat that.

My Red Dragon Roll came fairly quickly (~10 minutes) and had some decent crunch, but other than that texture and flavor were rather bland. On the good side of bland, to be sure! but still bland. Basically, a suitable place for food if it's late and pouring really hard outside and you just want to find the nearest restaurant because water is slowly but surely starting to seep into your shoes.\n\nDecor is reeeaally nice and modern though, loved it. If I come again maybe I'll take advantage of the 2-for-1 drinks deal. Mmm drinks. Mmm alcohol.", "author": "Millie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-22", "description": "This restaurant really has it all.  It is my go-to place every time I want to get together with a group of people.  The food is very good, sushi is very fresh, and the presentation is absolutely beautiful! (See pictures)  As if all that isn't enough, the restaurant has a happy hour from open to close with 2 for 1 drinks!  And as a martini drinker, I fully expected that my martini would be watered down, but no!  I have NO idea why Ozu isn't packed every day of the week, but as some reviewers mentioned, it's usually half empty, if even that much. My partner isn't really a big sushi fan, but there is enough cooked food on the menu to keep him happy, as well.  Prices are good (considering the neighborhood) and I am unfailingly met by cheerful and polite serving staff.

The food is pretty decent, have had the duck salad a few times, as well as the sashimi entr\u00e9e, and sushi rolls very tasty. I'm a fan of the bogo drinks, but they sometimes forget to adjust it on the bill, so keep an eye out for that. Also the waitresses don't seem to be very knowledgeable of the menu, and don't really seem to be very experienced either, and messed up my order almost every time I've been here so that's been pretty annoying. Delivery is very quick and the lunch specials are pretty decent too.
