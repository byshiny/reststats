It has great food for both lunch and breakfast. I've also had some drinks at the bar here before walking to a concert. I came her often over the summer since I used to work over in Brooklyn. Even though I no longer work over here whenever I am around the area I make it a point to come back. The service is quick and the people are super sweet and full of love. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming.

This includes one employee in particular who traipsed from one end of the dining area to the other singing along uninhibitedly to Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell that was playing over the stereo, which was also too loud, as usual. She also opened the front doors, ostensibly to air the place out, except that it was 54 degrees outside! Treat your customers with some respect!

It's pretty big with lots of communal tables and lots of room (for a local coffee spot in Brooklyn) in the front area. Whoever decorates here is lots of fun: colorful flowers and mirrors everywhere-yet doesn't distract from the relaxed vibe. Seems like a good place to get work done or have an intimate conversation. \n\nI know, sounds like a 4 star rating except every time I go I try something different and it's always meh. This is just for coffee, I haven't tried the pastries (which look really good) or sandwiches or anything. \nI got a latte once and it was just that, a latte. Nothing really more to recommend it except I drank the whole thing and didn't totally regret it at the end, but I didn't exactly enjoy it either. (I know, sounds so picky and if you are cool with whatever coffee then you'll probably be fine!) \nLast time I was there I got a green iced tea and it was ok. A little watered down tasting, not a very clear favor to it.\n\nSo that's the story. It's fine. Not amazing but not bad either.", "author": "Allana D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-03", "description": "A friend and I were taking a stroll through Fort Greene on a cool December afternoon. I don't live in BK, but since my friend was visiting from Spain, we decided to wonder through some neighborhoods that I don't usually frequent. Since it was actually quite cold outside, we were in the mood for a warm drink to carry on our walk. We stopped in front of Greene Grape Annex, I \"Yelp'd\" it, and we went inside. It's a pretty large space with a variety of seating options. There were people catching up with friends, eating, reading, and doing work on laptops. It was pretty full when we walked in, but given the number of people inside, it wasn't too loud. Two women were working behind the bar; one taking orders and the other making drinks. They worked super fast, and the line moved quickly! My friend and I both ordered hot chai lattes. They were good -- full of flavor, not too sweet, and with a little spicy kick at the end. I'm not usually in Fort Greene, but if I find myself in the neighborhood, I would stop by again.", "author": "Chi E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-22", "description": "Meh.

Visited on a Friday at 2:20 pm. Ordered a toasted sandwich that took 20 minutes to make. They don't know how to multitask - the food prep guy completed the order before mine and waited around while it was cooking before even starting my basic sandwich.

Don't get me wrong, it's a solid place to get work done but not for an extended stay. I had to purchase something every time I wanted to use the Wi-fi which I found ridiculous and turned me off. (Because of this, they've lost a customer. Wi-fi should not be based on purchases in a cafe.) People are trying to get work done so an hour of wi-fi is simply too short. Also, the wi-fi is pretty unreliable - I kept getting kicked out of the network which is not good. Lastly, their customer service is lacking. Some of them behind the counter are nice but overall, a cafe should feel warmer. \n\nI ordered a Paloma, Matcha Latte and a Plum Brioche - pretty decent.\n\nIn terms of work environment, there's an abundance of outlets but the area can get tight. Also, because people must purchase something to use the wi-fi, the work table gets filled with empty cups and dishes that are not picked up or cleaned by any staff. The music is also loud. It reminds me of a bustling open office but I prefer a more quieter environment so I will be looking elsewhere. \n\nWith the mixture of poor customer service, lack of cleaning the work area and a purchase of an item every hour in order to use the wi-fi, I will never come back here again. There are a plethora of better cafes - so Greene Grape Annex needs to humble itself a bit.", "author": "Annette C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-14", "description": "I like the space. It's inviting and cozy. What I don't like is the fact that you only get 1 hr of wi-fi when you purchase an item. The chai iced latte was good but I ended up just purchasing 24 hr wifi access for $4.99 when my hour was up rather than buying ehh food items that end up more pricey.\n\nRidiculous wifi model although it at least offers wi-fi unlike Hungry Ghost down the street.", "author": "Leilani L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "Decided to visit Greene Grape Annex to kill time while waiting for  my table at Brooklyn Moon Cafe to be called .

It is a cafe. It has brunch. It does drinks and happy hour. I mean, can you ask for anything more?  The vibe is so relaxed by clean and yet brooklyn but also cozy. Annex gets it all right on. Went to see a movie at BAM and we were looking for the after movie drink spot and so glad we walked in here.  I had been here before with friends and didn't realize they had adult beverages so it was a pleasant surprise.  Their double chocolate sea salt cookie was chocolatey with that beautiful touch of salty goodness. The French 75 was crisp and refreshing for a hot summer night. The Rioja was dark and smooth. The staff were super friendly.

Many of the tables, however, have no laptop signs. My friend and I bought $20 in coffee and cake after which we realized that the only tables available had \"No Laptop signs.\" Our decision to meet at GGA was for a working lunch, get some things done, chat, enjoy some treats. We couldn't.The staff was fairly cool/rude about it, and in the end, it was neither a productive or enjoyable visit. \n\nWe would have been there for the same amount of time either way. We spent the money and in truth getting us to stay longer would only have meant spending more.\n\nI understand camping is a financial problem, but so is not finding a way to accommodate paying customers. Rather than having rules about table use, you could just set a time limit on campers - 2 or 3 hours max - something like that. \n\nComing here just wasn't pleasant, and I think its fundamental to the seating rules and the staff.
