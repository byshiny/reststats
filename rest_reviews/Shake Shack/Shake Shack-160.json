Bella, our pup, on the other hand, LOVED the doggy ice-cream and the giant biscuit was her favorite (too).\n\nCall it early opening-itis.

Great views and lots of seating inside and out. Not too busy when I went on a friday early evening. \n\nTheir burgers are always good! Got a poochini for the first time and of course, my dog gobbled it up. \n\nWhen did their fries stopped being crinkle cut?!

This particular location is one of my favorites. Its right next to the water in DUMBO and by pier 1, with the most amazing views of the water and Manhattan. Expect lines at this location but know they move pretty quickly. Finding a table might be a bit of an issue but if you wait around a bit you'll find one.

Go get a table by the window and just see the Brooklyn Bridge staring back at you. Amazing. My fiancee, sister, and I stopped by here as we were going around exploring Brooklyn (DUMBO) on a rainy day in February. There was almost nobody in the restaurant, so we got to get a table with a very nice view out the window. This was my fiancee's first time in New York, and basically her first time seeing the Brooklyn Bridge, so it was quite an enjoyable experience to be able to sit there with some nice Chick'n Shacks and the very tasty Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate, looking out the window.", "author": "Ben W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-28", "description": "Despite the crowd and the wait, my time her was well worth it. Delicious burgers and fries in DUMBO, under the Brooklyn Bridge right off the water on a Friday night, how relaxing. \n\nThe store is designed very nice with cool seating. Love the fact you can get free cold water while you wait or as an healthier option. But sometimes that goes out the window, the SHAKE, was sooooo good!!\n\nIt's a very happening place and I'm sure it will do great because of its location. The one thing I didn't appreciate is the fact that they never gave us my daughter's burger and when my wife went back, the asshole behind the counter (I wish I had his name) insinuated to my wife that she did get the burger and just wanted \"another one\" REALLY, gonna make myself look like a fool scamming the system over a $5 dollar burger!!! Either management needs to demand respect for customers from their employees or need to have them practice counting the number of burgers they place on the tray. And that person is why I didn't feel a 5th star was warranted. And it's a shame because the first we dealt with was very courteous and professional.", "author": "Tony C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-05", "description": "visiting nyc and this was on my to-eat list. Yup - the burger was delicious. Don't bother with the cheese fries - you will be disappointed. Also, I thought it was expensive and don't think I'll go again. We went on a gorgeous summer day and the place was jam packed. It was one of those 'everyone split up \u0026 spread out to hunt down a free table' kind of day, but from what I've heard this dumbo location is almost always that way. There was a bit of a wait for our food and no real space to wait for it. People were standing in front of the soda fountain, right next to the ordering line, kind of all over the place..despite being given those beeper thingys.

Or is it ambitious? Maybe a little bit of both? \n\nI'm glad I discovered your Brooklyn location after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge with some friends. I was desperate to try the Shack Stack burger, as it came highly recommended from a fellow Shack enthusiast. To wash it down, I ordered the Shackmeister Ale, which is brewed exclusively by Brooklyn Brewery for Shake Shack. How authentic and cool of me to drink that beer in Brooklyn, haha. \n\nShake Shack, I spend my days thinking about you. As a visitor from Detroit, I highly encourage you to get here soon. It'd be a hit and I'd be your #1 visitor. \n\nLove, \nAlex", "author": "Alexandra K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-09-29", "description": "Good food, bad service. After waiting 10 mins to place my order, my cashier DENISE was clearly annoyed to take my order. As I tell her my order, she turns to converse with the cashier next to her. When she is finally done with her conversation, she looks back at me, still annoyed and tells me she didn't hear what I said and acts like she is doing me a favor by taking my order.\n\nI have worked in customer service all my life. No matter how difficult your job is, the goal is not to piss off your customer. If you can't stand the heat, get out or get an attitude adjustment.\u00a0\n\nI also ordered a double ice cream-- when the server gave it to me the ice cream was already dripping all over the cone and down to the floor. Part of the cone was also broken, no apology or anything. \n\nExpect to wait at least 20 - 30 mins for your food from start to finish.\n\nIF YOU ENJOY RUDE CASHIERS AND RUINED FOOD, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.", "author": "Nana C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-22", "description": "My first Shake Shack experience.
