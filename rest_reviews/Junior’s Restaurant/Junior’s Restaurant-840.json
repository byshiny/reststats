I thought that it would be really touristy but it wasn't at all. I went to the cocktail lounge that has an entrance on Dekalb not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised. The cocktails are, as the bartender put it, \"not a normal pour because they pour heavy\" and are only $7. The house salad was really big, tasty and reasonably priced but the wings were just ok. There were a lot of locals and I don't think I saw one tourist in the cocktail lounge area. My favorite part of the place was the bartender who was really funny and knew what he was doing. He blew my mind when he told me the day of the week I was are born on when I told him my birth date. \n\nAs I said, I walked past this place a million times and never went in but not anymore.", "author": "Collin B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-02", "description": "Don't know what all the fuss is about.

I left her in the car and went inside to get some cheesecake to go. I got the strawberry. It wasn't cheap but since I was already out here and no one shuts up about how good it is, I decided to get a couple of slices. \n\nI got back to the car and my sister says she just gave money to the lady over there and points. I asked why, and she says she came over and demanded it. I looked at the lady she pointed at and she saw me and quickly scampered away not unlike a roach in the kitchen when you turn your light on. I guess she thought I was gonna ask for the money back. Which I was gonna do. \n\nSo I guess the moral of the story is, this isn't the best neighborhood in the world.

It was SO delicious. It took a while to get back to New York, but once there Junior's cheesecake was on the list of \"things to do\"! We went again and it was still just as good. I had the original cheesecake, I liked it better than the flavored ones that I tried off of a friend's order. I haven't ordered the food, just cheesecake and coffee. But it was worth the trek through Brooklyn to get there.

What happened to the cheese \u0026 the croutons? I had to take that salad back. $15 for lettuce \u0026 chicken is unacceptable.\n\nWhen I took back the salad they told me that I meant to order the \"house salad with grilled chicken\". No, that is not what I meant to order. I informed them that after doing 4 years of college across the street at Long Island University, \u0026 eating the chicken ceasar salad atleast two times a week for those four years, I knew exactly what I was ordering.  I asked them if they had changed chefs \u0026 they said \"no\". That is a LIE! \n\nThe house salad was too busy for me \u0026 I did not enjoy it at all. There was way too much going on in that salad. At any rate, I will never order a ceasar salad from Juniors again. It really is a shame because that salad was so delicious back in the day. \n\nOn a side note: Prior to packaging the food, they used to show you what you were getting. I should've noticed that they did not do that. I guess that is a sign of the times.

Maybe it was the old-school Hollywood vibe it gave off, with the '50s music and black and white photos of Fred Astaire, Frank Sinatra, and the like. I truly felt as if I had been transported to a different era. Or perhaps it was the waiter, an elderly man who almost seemed of that era, dancing to a rhythm he was beating out in his head while serving us. Or maybe it was the fact that the Christmas decorations were still up and the whole place seemed so magical. \n\nHUGE menu. I ordered a lunch special - a BBQ pulled pork sandwich with steak fries. Delish! However, I may be the only person who loves Junior's food but is not in love with their cheesecakes. I ordered a strawberry shortcake cheesecake, and was not a huge fan of the strawberry creamy/jelly filling. Too sweet and mushy. My friend ordered a Red Velvet cheesecake, and while I thought it was better (the cake part was moist and wonderful), I still felt the cheesecake and frosting were waaay too sweet. \n\nHowever, I'm still giving this place 5-stars because the service was good, the food was great, and the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. When I came home, my bf asked me how it was, and all I could say was the Junior's was a \"truly special place.\"", "author": "Rea D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-10", "description": "Never say in to eat here just really stopped in for a quick slice of cheese cake to fulfill my cravings.

Which was disappointing because everyone was raving about their cheesecake. Obviously they haven't experienced the real deal. \n\nI was really disapointed by the fact that the slices are already cut, and packaged - which I question how fresh the cheesecake really is. The presentation of the pies on display were sloppy also, they didn't look very appealing. \n\nI got the strawberry cheesecake, the cream cheese is really thick, I could only eat half of it, and there are huge strawberry chunks on top.
