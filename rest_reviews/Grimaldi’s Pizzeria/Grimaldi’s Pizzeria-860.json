We got there and waited a max 10 minutes before getting in on a flash flooding Saturday evening.  They had waited a total of 40 minutes.\n\nBefore getting to the pizza, I must say, the Brooklyn-born root beer is delicious!\n\nA group of 4 of us got a large regular (sauce) pizza with sausage and onions and a small white pizza - plain.  The sauce on the regular pizza and the combination of amazing sausage was awesome.  Loved it.  The white pizza, not so much - it was a bit too plain and like cheesy bread for my liking.  I would have liked more fresh garlic as well (-.5 stars).\n\nOn the way out, I was apparently in a waiter's way, and he proceeded to take a menu and slap me in the back to get out of the way.  Really?  RUDE.  Minus .5 stars for that.\n\nOverall, a nice, cheap food excursion.  Will be back if I don't have to stand in line again :)", "author": "Allene T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-15", "description": "Loved the pizza :) \n\nSaturday night. 6:30pm. Wait was about 45 minutes for 2. \n\nRegular small pizza with sausage and mushroom. It was great! It's not your typical neighborhood pizza. The tomato sauce was delicious. The mozzarella tasted fresh.

I mean what's the big deal, it's just a pizzaria right?\n\nI came on a weekday afternoon(around3:30pm)---no line! From what I've read from other reviewers, it is quite common that you will stumble onto a line when you're visiting this corner pizzaria. \n\nThe pizza was simple, fresh, and mind-blowingly delicious. I'm not a really big pizza eater but I couldn't stop myself from finishing the last piece of the pie.\nThe service is really quick and they are also very friendly.

He pushed my mother because we were standing at the door (like the rest of the people that were ahead of us before) and said \"This is my space\". We were seated in a 4 person table and another couple were seated rigth in beside us. Paper plates plastic cutlery, no beer, no wine. \"No alcohol\" should be announced outside. We wait like 40 minutes for the pizza. It LOOKs good...only looks! Bland pizza, soft crust with burned areas. I have to use salt and garlic powder to gice some flavor...there is better pizza back home at Puerto Rico.

It's a total pain in the butt to go to this place but it is completely worth it. We waited for 45 minutes in 95 degree heat to get in to this place, and it doesn't have air conditioning. But there we were, refusing to get out of line, on this pizza pilgrimage. Sounds like hell right? Before we started eating it felt like it, and we kept saying things like, \"This better be worth it,\" as we grumbled in line drowning in sweat. \n\nBut even with all of that, I'd go again. The dough is what does it. The chewy, stretchy, but crispy dough! It's perfect and I would eat that dough every day if I could. We got 2 small pizzas for the 2 of us- 1 white pizza and 1 italian sausage pizza, and we ate both of them. All of it. I'm almost embarrassed to admit it but that's how good this pizza is.

A man behind the bar came over and asked if we seated ourselves with a nasty tone because there were people waiting before us,  we told him no that the lady seated us and he walks away with the same attitude.  I was hoping the pizza made up for it, the crust was burnt and hard.

It was good,, not great. There are far more excellent pizza joints in Brooklyn.\n\nThe lines are ridiculous; I have no proof, but I think money changed hands between the tour bus companies and Grimaldi's. \n\nJuliana's (in Grimaldi's previous space) is far better without lines that are as long. \n\n\nLucali's on Henry Street was great. I haven't been there in a long time. \n\nThe House of Pizza and Calzone on Union between Hicks and Columbia is my favorite.", "author": "Jonathan H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-18", "description": "The famous walk, the famous pizza at the end. My boyfriend had just finished walking the Brooklyn Bridge and was thrilled to have this place be the prize at the end. We got to the restaurant around 2 PM and luckily it was busy but because it was 2 PM we didn't have to wait. \n\nDISCLAIMER: They only take cash! We had to use their atm to get money out. Bring cash!\n\nWe decided on a small pizza with sausage, onion, and mushroom. When I saw small pizza, I figured it wouldn't be that big. Nope, it's pretty big. It says feeds 2-3. It can probably feed 2 very hungry people. Either way, the pizza is big. The pizza itself was pretty good. I was super excited to try the famous NY pizza. I think I was expecting this overly amazing meal because of how much people hyped it up to me. Too bad after I bit into it, I wasn't overly amazed. The pizza is good and I'm glad I tried it, but it didn't amaze me. What I did like about the pizza, is the crust was perfectly crispy and they add full basil leaves on top of the pizza. I love basil so it worked for me. \n\nI'm glad I tried Grimaldi's and it was good, I just wasn't amazed.

NAIL ON THE HEAD! \n\nThis was my first real NY pizza experience 7 years ago and it's on the to-do list every year we go to NY.  \n\nIt's a great tourist experience.  Under the Brooklyn Bridge, wait in line, see them toss the dough, it's comes out steaming hot, and it's delicious.  It's also in a neat neighborhood.  \n\nThe line is serious.

The line stretches to the end of the block. But it's not a nightclub, it's Grimaldi's. It's New York. It's a big deal.  Even if the seating is super close to each other, the shoddy tv barely broadcasts the futbol game, the AC doesn't seem to work, and the wait is long (the oven shuts down for 2 hours in the afternoon) it's still worth it. It's all about the NYC experience.\n\nThe basic pizza is topped with basil and mozza. That's it. It's simple and it's delicious. The dough is unparalleled anywhere else, it's chewy but just enough that it's also soft. What kind of sorcery is this?! It's Grimaldi magic. The pie looks huge but when you're actually down into it, it goes really quick, the pie is super thin. One pizza was enough for the two of us, but I'm sure the men could polish off one to themselves comfortably.\n\nBecause their oven shuts down everyday from 3-5pm (I think) the line builds up incredibly fast.

The line went all the way to the end of the building but seemed to be moving quickly. It was raining but we had umbrellas and a poncho.

The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because our group waited for about an hour in line just to be seated, but it is worth the wait! Our group split the large Margarita pizza and we each got a cannoli for dessert. It ended up being about $10 per person. The staff was great and the manager was very nice and hilarious.

So I was expecting the same great food.  This location didn't meet up to my expectations.  We were seated quickly but the upstairs was super hot.  They had a fan running in the corner but that was it.  No liquor license. \n\nWe were served our drinks at room temperature with a couple of glasses of ice, but because it was warm in the room, the ice melted quickly.  We had to constantly ask for our water glasses to be refilled and get more ice.  \n\nNot sure I would come back to this location.

The server was friendly enough.\n\nWe ordered a small regular pizza with pepperonis and jalapenos. The pizza was served to us pretty quickly. \n\nThe pizza was phenomenal. All of the elements were in perfect balance with each other. The crust was light and crispy. The cheese was tasty but not greasy. The pepperoni was flavorful and the jalapenos were pleasantly spicy.

Another stranger, now friend (from Canada) told us about how they visit NYC each year especially this pizza. They told us all about the Nazi-doorkeeper at Grimaldi's and 100 ways to skip the queue. Thankfully, we dint have to do anything illegal to get in ;) \n \nLove the brick oven baked pizzas. The crunchy crispy crust perfectly compliments the fresh mozzarella.

The pizza is four stars - hot, fresh, and tasty. Not the best pizza I've ever had. I really expected it to be mind blowing. I would be equally satisfied with great pizza joints in Manhatten, and I think the pizza here is only marginally better. BUT the incredibly slow service (FIFTY FIVE minutes for ONE PIZZA?! geez louise!), the line out the door (ugh), and the rough (sometimes rude) waiters really bring my impression of this place down. They couldn't even offer something. Waiting almost 55 minutes is just ridiculous for pizza that is slightly above average at best. The restaurant is cramped, and they really need to add a brick oven or add liquor to the menu. Other than pizza,  a mediocre antipasto appetizer, a cannoli, and coffee/soda, you'll just have to sit there and twiddle your thumbs out of boredom.
