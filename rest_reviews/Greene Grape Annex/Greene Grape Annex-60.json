As far as coffee, food, and work atmosphere go, I have generally been very pleased. However, an unfortunate event occurred tonight, and I don't expect I will be going back.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were drinking coffee and doing work at a table (nearest the to the bathrooms, and in clear view of the bar/counter), when a large group of noisy teenagers came in. They headed straight for the bathrooms, and those who did not go in congregated around our table. One boy sat down across from us and told my girlfriend how pretty she was (unnecessary, but thanks for the compliment). Then he kept loudly chatting with his friends. OK, that's also fine. We tried ignoring them, and continued on with our work.\n\nThe next thing I know, I am being sprayed in the ear with an aerosol can. I assume it was hairspray, though it could have been bug spray. I don't know, and it doesn't really matter. Anyway, I turn to the girl who just did that, and I ask her what the heck she's doing, and she just scurries away to the bathroom. I look around to see if anyone working there is paying any attention, and I give a \"are you serious?\" look at the guy behind the counter who is watching this go down. He comes over and tells them, \"Sorry, I can't have you spraying our customers in the ear.\" Fine. That is *literally* the least he could do, but at least the staff is acknowledging these kids are being disruptive.\n\nNow it's clear we have three options: try to ignore them and hope they go about their business, move to another table (or ask them to move), or leave the cafe. We give them the benefit of the doubt that these are just some kids being kids, and we try to ignore them and go about our work. It's about this time that one of the boys comes out of the bathroom, poorly trying to conceal all of the toilet paper he is stealing, and joins the first boy (\"you're so pretty\") across the table from us. Immediately they start telling my girlfriend they \"want to get her pu$$y\" and that I \"wasn't giving her the real di\u00a2k.\" I cast another \"really? Are you serious?\" look at the staff, get no response, and my girlfriend and I decide we're going to change tables.\n\nThat's when the first boy chimes in, to my girlfriend, \"If you leave, I'm gonna hurt you.\" I say to him, \"What did you just say to her? Are you threatening her?\" He ignores me. We say we're leaving (though I don't feel entirely comfortable going outside, seeing as how we are outnumbered and have just been threatened, even if it was only by a bunch of kids). By this point (I assume they have all the toilet paper they can handle and/or are attracting enough attention through their obnoxiousness) they realize it is time to leave.\n\nMy girlfriend and I are pretty upset at this point. We felt annoyed, harassed, and threatened, and nobody working there seemed to care about what was going on. I can't blame the cafe for having the occasional annoying patrons, but I can be upset that nobody working there made any attempt to get them to leave once they became disruptive. Even if I give them the benefit of the doubt that they somehow didn't notice everything that was going on, they should have at least been more vigilant.\n\nBefore we left we told one of the workers (he might have been a manager?) what had happened, and he said he \"would be happy to kick people out, but I was downstairs\" and \"what do [we] want [him] to do about it?\" I guess he's right. What do we want him to do about it? Perhaps not sound so dismissive of our ordeal, or perhaps offer so much as an apology? Whatever, we're not getting bent out of shape over any hurt feelings. I would just think that a customer service establishment would show a little concern for the wellbeing of its patrons while they were in its store.\n\nOther than that manager making us feel like we somehow inconvenienced him by relaying our bad experience, none of the staff were mean or anything. And whenever I have been there during the day (with different staff), most everyone has been very pleasant. I like the shop, but after my experience I can't see a reason I would head back there over other nearby spots.", "author": "Steven R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-26", "description": "- Dope music (Wu-Tang, Dr. Dre, and the likes)\n- Yummy food (Had the farro salad and it was so good!)\n- Tasty teas (Try the green and licorice one)\n- Wine and beer available \n- Comfortable seating areas\n- Laptop free zones\n\nDope little spot and I'll be back.", "author": "Dani J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "I wrote a book in this place.

However, I think I would have been upset if it was more crowded when I was looking for a seat and couldn't find an open laptop seat, since I came with my laptop in tow. Not to mention that people in the non-laptop seats were talking on phones, typing away on tablets, etc. I mean, c'mon.\n\nSeems to me it'd be better to ask people to *limit* their laptop use in certain spots. That way, they'd know they should jump for a laptop seat when it becomes available and wouldn't hog up those seats all day (which is essentially what the policy is intended to do) rather than kicking laptop users out altogether.\n\nChange that and I'd lean toward 4 or 5 stars.", "author": "Cassidy P."}], "servesCuisine": "Cafes", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Greene Grape Annex", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "753 Fulton St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/5gjfCtspGqcOBrXXVmRb4A/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584791"}
