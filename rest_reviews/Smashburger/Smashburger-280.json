Pretty good, but not what I'm used to...the patty is only black bean, i prefer more of mixture of veggies - the beans kinda leaves a starchy texture and taste but i still really liked the burger overall. i can't wait to try  the chicken...", "author": "Vanessa H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-10", "description": "Went here yesterday for a work lunch and will not only be recommending it to people, but will be frequenting this spot for my next burger fix!  Really tasty and manageable to eat (not too big I can hardly bite) burgers with a variety of combinations.  I had the New York w/caramelized onions and aioli.  I had to give the 5th star as they also make one of my favorite items - fried pickles.  And they were delish.

Bravo.  The sides may not be worth ordering - flash fried veggies are a soggy greasy mess though the fries are pretty decent if you looking for an accompaniment to your meal.  \n\nIt's so funny that this location is about a block away from my favorite burger chain in the world, Five Guys, and I still choose to come here sometimes - not bad!", "author": "Christina Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-07", "description": "The most consistent, efficient, pleasant, clean, courteous, fast and wallet friendly fast-good-food burger spot in town.", "author": "D R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-13", "description": "A real real good burger, delicious fries, fast to-go service but upgraded enough so you don't feel like you just brought home McDs even though you are toting a greasy paper sack. .", "author": "Elizabeth B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-15", "description": "The Burgers are fantastic, I highly recommend the grilled avocado chicken club.

I know a good burger when I'm chomping on one and trust me: Smashburger blows everything else out of the water. Juicy, flavorful, a hint of pink in the middle, beautifully spiced -- this is to regular fast food as Radiohead is to Air Supply.

It was a good burger, greasy fries, interesting fried pickles. They serve beer, and shakes.

Both were good but I prefer the spicy baja. Sweet potato fries complimented the meal quite nicely and they had free refills. A little pricey to eat there for students, I never went there when I attended Tech but gave it a try when I went to visit. I heard good things about the shakes so I'll probably come back and try it sometime.", "author": "Andy C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-15", "description": "I wanted to love this place, I really did. We went on a Saturday night and it was empty.  Whilst studying the menu, an employee came over to offer help which was nice.   We split a big smash spicy Baja Burger and sweet potato fries.   The Burger wasn't as big as expected and could easily be eaten by one person.   I was disappointed because the patty was so small and despite all the ingredients was a little bland.  :(  the sweet potato fries were very good but ithink the seasonings would taste better on regular fries.  Free refills on soda! I begrudgingly have to say Five Guys is better but my boyfriend disagrees.

Order your burger (beef or chicken), pay and then sit down with a soda and relax.  Our smiling \"runner\" brought out our meals and made sure we had everything we needed. Refills of self-service soft drinks are unlimited.  The burgers are delicious; a cross between Shake Shack and Pete's Burgers in Astoria.  The regular burger is sure to please most people but you can order a larger burger (and even extra meat) if you like.  The spicy baja burger was really good and the fresh jalapeno gave it an unexpected crunch.  The sides are just \"okay\" and not very big.  I thought the onion rings were salty, but really didn't mind.  I was impressed by the genuine eagerness to please exhibited by all the employees as well as the cleanliness of the restaurant.  The staff is still learning, but they are so sincere their \"misses\" were easily forgiven.", "author": "Undercova A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-22", "description": "A greasy version of Wendys.

I used to be a student in the area and of course, they would wait until i graduate to open this =/. I'm a burger fanatic so I was chomping at the bit to try this place out. I should mention that I intentionally came here later in the evening because there are a few businesses as well as a college and high school nearby, so I'm sure this place can get PACKED during lunchtime and around the time school gets out! \nThe customer service is great...the people are friendly, super helpful, and when dining in, the manager even walks around to inquire about how things are going. They give you a table marker when you decide to dine so you can sit down and they'll bring your food right to your table. There are also containers of ketchup and mustard at each table so you don't have to walk around to \"borrow\" some haha. An employee comes around when you're done and throws away your container...always a welcome nicety, \n\nAs far as the food goes, I had the smashburger which is a 1/3 pound. the big smash is 1/2 pound FYI. In my opinion, on a day when you're hungry, the smash size is perfect! Anyway as per policy, their burgers are cooked medium, so if you want a more well done burger, I suppose you can ask them to do so.  \n\n I must say, though, that this was the greasiest burger I've had in a while, which was kinda unexpected for a place such as this...I'd expect greasy burgers from some mom and pop store, not a specialty burger place like this. It wasn't so greasy that I would vow never to come back, but things can get a bit messy, so smashburger knew what they were doing when they included a stack of napkins at each table...you'll definitely need them! I've actually found that sometimes I prefer to carry out only because the traveling time allows all the ingredients to mesh together and the wrapper to soak up the excess oil, so by the time I get home, its neatly packed burger perfection! I loved that they had many options as to sides, sauces, toppings and cheeses. and OH, they have soda floats! They also offer an assortment of bread! the showstopper here (and also my newest obsession) is their CHIPOTLE BREAD! yup thats right... spicy bread! *drool* I seriously considered bumping this review up to  4 stars just because of the awesomeness of this bread! \n\nSmashburger has a special place in my heart because they have chipotle mayo, which is my weakness ;). One of my favorite burger places is 5 guys and while they make a terrific burger and obsessively good fries, I always lamented about their lack of customization options and sides..this is where smashburger has them beat. \n\nWhile, they do have regular fries but they also offer their signature,  'smashfries'. Smashfries are either regular fries or sweet potato fries that are dusted with garlic and rosemary. I opted for the sweet potato smashfries and although,  they were tasty and i do eat them on occassion, I still prefer prefer traditional sweet potato fries more (which to my knowledge, Smashburger doesn't offer). The sweetness of the sweet potato contrasted my the salty/tangy flavor of the garlic and rosemary had my mouth confused!. Who knows...maybe I can try to tell them to somehow omit the seasoning...\nI'm also used to a chunkier sweet potato fry but the shoestring style served at smashburger will do. \n\nThe price, in my opinion is reasonable and typical of a burger restaurant, if not cheaper..I had a burger, sides, and a drink and it was $12 even and it was money well spent.
