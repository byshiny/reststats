The service was friendly and the food comes out FAST. An appetizer, two entrees, two drinks, and a dessert was $90 including tip.\n\nFor the same price, you can eat sparingly at one of the only two good restaurants in the neighborhood (Vinegar Hill House) and feast like a king at the other (Juliana's Pizza). I'd just as soon go to either of those places, (or heck, get a sandwich from Foragers). But because of the dearth of restaurants in DUMBO, they will be packed all the time and make a lot of money. It just won't be my money.", "author": "Steve C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-30", "description": "We ate out few times while in NY, but this is the only place I wish was in Boston. I would definitely visit at least once a week. Meals were delicious, drinks tasty, and staff friendly.

Cheery waitress, yummy burger, not so great dessert. \n\nThere are only two bathrooms, you might wait a while to use the loo. \n\nIf you leave your coat on the back of your chair rather than hang it up, your chair will fall over backwards (happened to three people while we were there).", "author": "erika s."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-22", "description": "SO GOOD!!

None of us have ever heard of this place. What a pleasant surprise! The market vegetables were really good, especially the deal where you get a combo of four. Both of my friends ordered it, and I ordered grilled salmon with two sides of market vegetables, Asian-style bok choy and artichokes with parmesan. All was excellent. We then had really nice tea with cinnamon sticks and lemon.", "author": "Anna B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-15", "description": "thank goodness for Westville in Dumbo. We were in need of this comfortable dining atmosphere with variety + easy menu with somewhat healthy options. After a long renovation, it has finally opened, and we are so very happy. We(my husband and I) were always big fans of westville. We relocated from East Village to Dumbo about a year ago. We love Dumbo, but it seriously lacks dining options compare to our beloved East Village. So we are very happy and can't wait for the outdoor space to open up :) \n\nmust try: french fries ... don't get one to share, get your own, you won't regret :)  I had crab burger the other off of their daily special menu. It was amazing :) \n\nAnyone wants to open a good ramen or asian spot in dumbo? We need that too !!!", "author": "Christine H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "It was pretty good. Food is kind of expensive but that's expected of Dumbo. It was close to work so I came with my co-workers. Not much seats inside so they offered us to sit out in the yard. Food was good but I wish there were more seats inside because sitting outside was uncomfortable when the sun kept shining on me.Great service and setting. Very lovely outdoor patio seating is available.", "author": "Michael J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-25", "description": "went here for Saturday brunch! Got seated and served really fast. Our waiteress was very nice and food came quickly. Had the avocado toast and it was very delicious. The place had a nice hipster aesthetic vibe and was very comfy.

Our friend that lives in Dumbo recommended it as they have a lot of vegan/veggie options.  I ordered the mac and cheese for my son and I asked the waitress if there was any bacon in it because we are vegetarian.   She said no there isn't.   When we got the mac and cheese my wife and I tried it and she immediately said it tastes like bacon so we did some digging and sure enough some small bits of bacon were in there.     \n\nWe told the waitress and she apologized and took it back then another waiter (maybe manager) came by and said \"I looked there's no bacon in your mac and cheese but it's ok we'll make you a new one on the house\"   Nothing like being called a liar.  I told him I could show him the bacon he just said \"No it's ok and walked away\"   As a matter of fact I still had the small piece of bacon on my plate. He came by later and apologized if he offended us and offered dessert on the house.  We politely declined.\n\nThe food was ok.   Quinoa and Artichoke burger was bland.  Truffle parmesan fries did not even slightly taste like truffle.   My son enjoyed the second round of baconless mac and cheese.", "author": "Daniel C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-22", "description": "The place has great foods.

Not realizing that we should have made a reservation, we waited 15 minutes to be seated - it's worth the wait. The amazing location, delicious food, friendly staff, inviting ambiance, and vegan friendly options make for a satisfying and delighting experience. Highly Recommended for those who've never been.

If I want a well mixed cocktail and some good ole veggies to make the old lady happy with me, this is the place! Well priced too.\n\nI've just never been a fan of the overly bright/white decor of the westville chain. But thats more of a personal preference for dark woods and the occasional tv playing sports. It's kind of in that awkward spot between a lunch spot and a dinner place.", "author": "B C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-19", "description": "YESSS the market veggies are just so good.
