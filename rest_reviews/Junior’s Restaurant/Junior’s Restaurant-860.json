MOUTH 'GASM ALL OVER THE PLACE! Pardon that sudden burst of excitement. \n\nOne, if not, the best cheesecake in the NY area. As an avid baker, I can tell you that this cheesecake is simply dee to the freaking vine! DIVINE! I could seriously eat the whole thing by myself, and I have.\nNow I have only 1 qualm. Do not go to any other Junior's besides the one at DeKalb Ave. It is not the same, the one at DeKalb is the original. Totally worth taking the Q/B/R to Dekalb. It might be a little scary, especially since the area is sketchy, but worth the risk! \n\n**Now, Junior's has other foods, but I would not recommend the actual diner. One goes to Junior's for the cheesecake (I love the raspberry swirl cheesecake), the chocolate mousse cake, and the red velvet cake, that's it.", "author": "Nicholas G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-05", "description": "I've seen this place on TV for a zillion times and heard about it via word of mouth a zillion and one times. So,  when the opportunity to come to this temple to baked cheese and sugar presented itself, I couldn't resist.\n\nWe got seated surprisingly quickly, on a busy Saturday night.  I have to give it to management for buying such a large space and having the wisdom to make a quickserve counter for those who just want pastries to go.  The line was pretty deep there.  If you have a chance, take a quick look at the cheesecake shaped like the Juniors building under glass.\n\nMy party ordered the #1 Cheesecake and the black forest cheesecake along with some coffee.  Even on a full stomach, both slices were fabulous.  The fluffiness and richness of the cream cheese they make here kicks the buttocks off of all the Entenmann's cheesecakes I grew up on and my reference point.  I definitely want to go back. 2 down, 23 to go.", "author": "Keith O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-30", "description": "Anywhere else in the country a pastrami-corned beef reuben sandwich mighty be a tasty mess but is usually a) over-salted and b) greasy. The beauty that Junior's serves is neither. The side of homemade dressing was equally worthy. No BS 1000 Island but a subtly flavored (and not over-salted) sauce was served on the side that complimented the sandwich perfectly. Pickles and cole slaw were really good and there were plenty. Coffee was very good and cheesecake was out-of-the-park delicious. Service was friendly; bartender Tim was styled and cool, and there is a selection of at least three local brews on tap that were all good.

Be it a slice or two or a whole cake, this is what you want. Screw the Cheesecakes Factory, this cake is creamy, sweet with a nice Graham cracker crust.  The strawberries on top are nice and plump and the strawberry  sauce is sweet and brings it together.

I travel 60mins just to get some of there cornbread! First off the atmosphere is very like old school glam, secondly there cornbread is beyond anything in this world. Once you sit down they give you complimentary cornbread, pickles, beets and coleslaw (Talk about making sure your feed). Then there portions are OUT OF THIS WORLD!! They give you so much food it amazing!

I knew he loved cheesecake, because every time he orders some in New Jersey, he talks about how it's not a \"real New York cheesecake.\" But this mention of Junior's was new. \nSo for his 77th birthday, I had a plain cheesecake delivered from Junior's. Oh my gosh. He was beyond deliriously happy. My mom too, and she doesn't really like cheesecake. Apparently it came very securely wrapped so that nothing would happen to it in transit, and it was incredibly fresh. Believe me, my dad would have told me if it sucked or was just so-so. No, he thought it was beyond great.\nAm so relieved. At his age, he doesn't need a bunch of stuff to clutter up the house some more. He just wants simple things like comfort foods that make him happy and bring back good memories.

In fact my mom would come here regularly when she was pregnant with me in 1988. My family, friends, and Community supports this Restaurant. Today on the celebration of its 65th Anniversary, I came out extra early 7am to be exact to get my .65 cent slice of cheesecake and another slice for later. My God mother and I went together after learning that it was only 1 slice per person though it wasn't advertised on anything I read. When we reached the front she ordered her 2 slice and I handed Thomas the cashier $1.00 to pay for hers. When he was finished with her and handed me my change, he yelled next. I then informed him that I was next and I was ready to make my order. \"One per person he said\" I replied I'm aware, that's why she ordered hers and now I'm ordering hers. He ignored me and continued to call the next person. We began to argue because he was clearly wrong. Though  I paid for my God Moms cake she ordered it with her own bill, there were 2 separate people present, there was no violation of policy. Before I knew it things escalated and Thomas the cashier called me a Monkey. We began to really get heated in our insults in front of a long line of customers and full staff. He then slammed the drawer and walked away while cussing me. What really surprised me was security coming and accusing me of insulting him, while he was still cussing in the background. To make it even worse, The owner then approached me with a n attitude and asked me to stop yelling and to not make scene, tho his worker and I just had a heated confrontation in front of the entire restaurant all along he continued to cuss at me from a distance. \"I've owned this restaurant for 25 yrs, I've known him for 25 yrs and nothing has ever happened, he's just overwhelmed with all the customers\". If someone has been working at a major restaurant and landmark for 25 yrs and they become overwhelmed by customers ordering 1 slice of plain cheesecake for .65 cents by 7am when you just opened at 6:30 That's a concern. No one should become overwhelmed within a half hour. I CANNOT DEAL WITH ALL OF THE EXCUSES, BEING ACCUSED OF CAUSING AN ISSUE I DIDN'T START, AND THEN NOT EVEN BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MY DISSATISFICATION WITH HORRIBLE DISRESPECTFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.

However, if I want cheesecake then I prefer Junior's.\n\nI do not like Cheesecake Factory cheesecake. I do not like Italian ricotta style either.\n\nMy personal favorite here is the Carrot Cake Cheesecake- its moist spicy carrot cake layered with junior's Cheesecake- its divine. Also, I love their Pumpkin Cheesecake- just the right amount of seasonal spice, pumpkin flavor with a nice graham cracker crust. \n\nIt's a NYC institution because its excellent- it isn't (just) a tourist attraction. They bake thousands a day, ship all over the world \u0026 patrons wait in line for a reason. Its excellent!\n\nThe decor is totally 70's Soul Train lol.
