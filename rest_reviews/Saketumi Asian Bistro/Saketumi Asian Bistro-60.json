REMEMBER CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT . ALSO WHY DONT U ASK YOUR STAFF WHY ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLES AFFAIRS AS THEY have no right . ALSO your food's flavor  is wanting . The pad Thai has a burnt after taste that is really revolting.  Start with that as your place is will never prosper due to poor cooking techniques.", "author": "Hans Albert S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-11", "description": "Great food, very fast delivery.\nTheir lunch special is awesome and there are a lot of choices of specials.\nHighly recommend!", "author": "Lauren J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-08", "description": "This is my girlfriend and I favorite sushi spot.

The food is wonderful and the waitresses are darlings! My favorite item is the Naruto roll which I only recently discovered. It's refreshing, and yummy but everything I have ordered here is delicious. My husband raves about the shumai (I don't like shrimp so I wouldn't know).

I absolutely love Montague street and all the ambiance of it all. The restaurant is small and cozy. The service was great. I ordered the volcano and some roll. Both very delicious, fresh and filling. I would absolutely come here again. They have a really extensive menu to choose from of not just sushi. I personally would just come back here for the sushi.

I forgot to bring extra cash on me and only had a debit card to pay after taxes which was around 2$ and there was a minimum but the lovely cashier let me pay anyway :) \n\nOverall, definitely give Saketumi a go if you're craving Asian cuisine and are in the Brooklyn Heights and Court Street area :)", "author": "Jenn Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-18", "description": "Great place to go to right by the piers.

I was charged for ordering online meanwhile at the restaurant, prices were much much lower. The eel and avocado roll was unacceptable. Countless bones were still in the fish, which was more sauce than actual eel that i paid for. I couldnt take more than a bite.

I tried to go back to my old places but most were closed or changed so I picked this one up. \n\nWeekday early dinner time, it was almost empty but the hostess was quite friendly and the food a O.K.

I would characterize this restaurant as a solid go-to neighborhood spot. For those of you trying to save some money, take advantage of the great deal they offer on Groupon.\n\nWhat I like about Saketumi is that the food is good, the service is excellent and the place feels comfortable. On our second time there, we had the crispy duck salad, the rainbow roll and pad thai. All three dishes were good. Our waitress was super attentive and, as an example, she refilled our hot tea four or five times during the meal. The food was served pretty quickly.", "author": "Alex W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-19", "description": "Great! Quick! Reliable! Been coming here for lunch for years and have never ever been disappointed. Is it a high end joint? By no means. But does it deliver fresh quick and delicious sushi? Absolutely. The word I use over and over here is \"reliability\" and honestly what more do you need from your fave lunch spot? Saketumi is not one of those hit-or-miss places- it always delivers consistently good food. The service is very friendly and efficient- the people working here are so hard working and nice!

I usually get a bunch of special rolls and Thai food, and they are ready for pickup within just 10 minutes. They are also very pleasant and polite over the phone, which is unheard of for these places. They actually spoke English, and I didn't need to repeat my order over and over, AND the order was completely correct.\n\nHere are some of the great special rolls and Thai food I've tried:\n\n\n- Play boy roll.                            - duck pai Thai \n- VCR Roll                                  - Thai red snapper\n- Dragon Roll                              -  curry noodle soup\n- spice scallop roll.                     - crispy duck\n- spicy girl roll\n- lobster tempura roll\n- Brooklyn Roll \n\nThey also actually put in the extra effort of giving you a package of fruit for dessert with your order, including pineapple, oranges and cantaloupe.\n\nGood quality food at decent prices with fast, friendly service. I will definitely be ordering up from here again in the future .", "author": "jayden l."}], "servesCuisine": "Sushi Bars", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Saketumi Asian Bistro", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "118 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CoHUWHgBTlas-BrfkcKkDw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188558688"}
