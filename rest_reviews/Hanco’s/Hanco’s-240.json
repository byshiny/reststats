The only issue I have with it is that when I requested the mild hot sauce on mine, they left out the spicy sauce.  Maybe it's that they don't put enough of it.\n\nSeeing as I haven't tried the other options here, I can't say that it is superior to its direct competitor.  I do love that there is seating and that I can lounge by the window, but seating is on high demand.  \n\nThe eye contact avoidance doesn't work here; people will stare and stare and then approach to ask if you're ready to leave.", "author": "Jenn F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-30", "description": "Hanco's is simple, good food prepared consistently.  \n\nThe service is friendly, if a touch disorganised when the rush begins.

Only thing you will taste is the resilient tannin in your palate. \n\nClassic Sandwich: thick and rich layer of pork, layered with ham and turkey. Very generous, savory bite; mayonnaise and grease in the pork blends well; however, about an inch and half short from typical saigon sandwich.", "author": "John D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-24", "description": "Good God I love this place.

Their pho and bubble tea are on point and made quickly. \n\nThey have 3 main seating spaces that begin with outdoor benches. Inside a small corner section can confortably seat 10-15 patrons.

Love Love Love the classic viet sandwich and the dark meat chicken sandwich. You get a choice of three spiciness levels (going spicy means jalapeno slices). Plus, if you're like me, someone who relishes in eating thru the pain of spice and heat, then grab a bottle of sriracha and squirt away! Huge variety of drinks but my personal fave is the Vietnamese Iced Coffee. \n\nAs for the Pho, I wasn't too impressed, especially with the cuts of beef and the variety of cuts. When you're at Hanco's, stick with the Banh Mi. \n\nAlways friendly service, bread is scrumptious, and the sandwich is stuffed to the gills!", "author": "Patrick K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-20", "description": "My boyfriend and I came here after we had Pho and a sandwich from Nicky's, and I have to say:  Hanco's sandwich is better.

My buddy ordered the grilled pork sandwich which had plenty of meat, but was apparently an afterthought compared to the Classic. I was not a fan of the shrimp spring rolls, not sure what was wrong with them--maybe too many noodles and not enough cilantro? And the sauce was too peanutty. However overall, the meal was aces, it was freezing cold outside so just what I needed. A tad overpriced, but given no other vietnamese options nearby, willing to pay.
