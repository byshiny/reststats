So I'm always out looking for the next best thing to Wing Heaven (doesn't exist yet sadly). \n\nMy coworkers and I decided to give this place a try and the first thing that stood out (in a bad way) was that they DON'T DELIVER! Can you believe that crap? How can you call yourself a wing establishment and not have the means to deliver your product to the masses...total bull. This still leaves me feeling a little upset primarily because when we actually went to pick the order up we had to drive around for a little while to find a decent park, just to run upstairs and collect the damn order. (woo saa)\n\nOkay I'm over it.....I'm over it because the wings are effn amazing. Like I've had wings from way too many places in the 5 boroughs to have this one stand out so much. I don't know if its the 12+ flavors that the wings came in, or the fact that I got to try them all in one sitting (with a few other people of course....im no slob lol), or maybe it was the fact that the wings were VERY meaty and well cooked, or possibly that they weren't soggy or too dry.......they were simply amazing and i must commend them on that.\n\nI'm sorry to say that they will be taking a lot of my money on the days that I work (If I forget my lunch home again :o).\n\nThey are located on the top floor of the Atlantic Mall, right next to the up escalators....trust me you cant miss them. I didn't have a chance to sample the drinks here or anything else they had on the menu but to be honest if the wings are this great they can't possibly have anything better than it.\n\n\n*Cash and Credit*", "author": "Quincy T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-12", "description": "Loved this place when it first opened.

I went to this location with a party of 4 on a Sunday for dinner, and our server basically told us that they were out of all beer except Bud Light, Blue Moon, and Shocktop.  After we ordered, another server came back and informed us that they were out of Shocktop too.  We asked for the check and left.  The prices were inflated, but that's to be expected after considering the close proximity to Barclays Center.

I've never had BWW before and as I entered, I was hit with such a wonderful BBQ aroma.. I ordered and the wait was over 20 mins, cashier didn't tell me, I overheard her telling another customer about the wait. Finally got my wings and wondered why they wasn't dripping with sauce, sauce was like skin tight jeans!! It was very bland BBQ sauce and the wings had no flavor whatsoever... The fries were the size of dollar fries at Mc Donalds, overpriced! I can make better wings at home.

Oh thats right.. Mass chaos.

One shouldn't say your next and the next say 45 minutes. \n\nPSSS - The manager shouldn't yell at people that they can't be at the bar and need to stand in line for the mentally challenged hostesses to get a hold of people. \n\nOh and by the way yelping from Applebees.

It has the sports bar feel to it but also kid friendly. They supply you with the \"safe\" high chairs (if you're a mom, you know what I mean) and coloring book with crayons. \n\nTuesday = 60 cent wings!!!\n\nTheir parmesan garlic wings are crave worthy! I love them just as much as I love the fried pickles.\n\nI knocked down a star because this time when I went, it seems like they cheaped out with coating the wings with the sauce.

My mom, sister and I waited in line for a long time. There was so much people, so I made a reservation and the lady told me that It would take like 35 minutes. It was like taking so long for us since we were starving, but finally they called us. We made a order of potatoes wedges, spinach artichoke chicken flatbread, buffalo wings dipped in parmesan garlic sauce, and the screaming nacho burger. The burger was delicious. The jalape\u00f1os had that spice that I was looking for, as well as the nachos that gave the burger a crunchiness. The buffalo wings would taste better if they were not so extremely dipped in that sauce, so I suppose that I would have to choose another sauce next time. The potatoes wedges were okay, nothing bad. Good thing is that I noticed that you can refill your drink ONLY if you order SODA or LEMONADE.

I came here on Mother's Day, but with a friend. Maybe all the staff was with their mothers? Dunno.\n\nThe host stand was half watched. I know because I waited in line for a long time only to have her come back and immediately seat people who had cut the line. We then had to wait, along with other upset people, even though there was literally a sea of empty tables but not enough waiters (their words, not mine). The hostess offered little in the way of an apology.\n\nThere was an employee standing there, maybe security? I guess he was guarding the unattended stand because he surely wasn't keeping any kind of line order. Nor taking notice of the young children alone in line who had called their mom asking, \"When can we eat? When are you coming back?\"\n\nAbout 10 minutes after being seated, our server finally showed up and he was less than enthused. \n\nWe ordered popcorn shrimp (already dead, but cooked to death some more to the point of being rubbery and with entirely too much breading), mini corn dogs (greasy and barely warm) and  jalape\u00f1os poppers (passable).

Located right in Atlantic Terminal Mall so you can grab something on the go or sit down with and enjoy a game, some drinks and decent sports bar food. Nothing really special but not bad either.

I had it for takeout. Why 1 star? The cashier/waiter is racist against Asians. She is an African American Lady name Christina/Christine. First she was not doing her job! When we first arrive at the counter, she choose to talk on the phone and when her coworker ask for help, she ignore him. Then when the guy took our order, he told us 15 minutes. We waited over 30 minutes. By the time she came out with boxes of food, there is already second wave of ppl waiting. She went through the boxes and call out names and never call out my husbands name. I watched her while she looked at our boxes several times and never call out our names. Her coworker, nice guy, asked her couple times and again she ignore him. He eventually went to get the food for us instead. This happened in front of our EYES!!! And we were the only Asians waiting for the food! I cannot believe that I'm getting this type of treatment in NYC!! It was not like we were being nasty customers! \nManagement Team:\nI hope this is not how you train your employees!!
