Great pizza, but eat it while it's hot.  Once it cools down, it's not half as good.  Paired with a carafe of house wine, you will feel like you are back in old Brooklyn.  The decor wouldn't disprove it either.  The red-checkered table clothes, somewhat gruff service, and graying photos of dead celebrities are all part of the Grimaldi's experience.  No, maybe it isn't the best pizza in the entire world, but it's pretty good, and worth the trip across the bridge.", "author": "Alison M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-29", "description": "I wasn't blown away.

We split 3 16\" pizzas between 5 ppl and we were all stuffed at the end. it came out to about $13/per person.

Your taste buds will be singing--Allelujah!! When you're in NY, stop by their place and it will be worth the trip. Don't be discouraged by the loooooong line, I promise you their ridiculously crispy-thin crust, that ooh-so-good sauce and whatever-you-top-it pizzas will make it WORTH your precious time. The downside: They don't take credit cards, CASH ONLY! and no reservations--that's why I give it 4 stars. Otherwise, Grimaldi's is absolutely fantastic !", "author": "Tricia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-26", "description": "After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, my friend and I waited in line for almost an hour before we were seated at Grimaldi's on a Sunday afternoon. While waiting in line, I did notice that the take-out line and the dining line are now one and the same. This was clearly stated at the entrance of the restaurant. I have to say the thin-crust pizza remains one of my favorites in NYC. However, I was put off by the service charge that was inserted into our bill. A review on another website said that the \"service charge\" was inserted because the diners looked like \"foreigners\". The simple one-page menu did not state that a service charge would be levied for 2 people dining at the restaurant. Has anyone else have had service charge levied on their final bill? \n\nBecause of the wait and the service charge inserted, I am giving this a 3-star.", "author": "Dawn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-11", "description": "Grimaldi's isn't all hype...they back it up with a mean brick-oven charred slice. Fresh mozzarella, tangy fresh tomato and your fav toppings make it worth the trip. But for God's sake, take the PATH and hit the one in Hoboken.

This pizza was exactly what I pictured New York pizza to be, thin crust and so delicious! We had the white pizza, and then a veggie pizza with roasted red peppers which were sweet and tasty and complimented the sauce really well. I also enjoyed the fact that while dining on my delectable pizza I was able to feast my eyes on photos of various celebrities that also enjoy this fine eatery. I must say, Grimaldi's was the perfect way to wrap up my NY vacay.", "author": "reina t."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-18", "description": "After a long morning walk around financial district to memorial park to across bk bridge, their thin crust hit the spot.", "author": "Derricho S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-18", "description": "Love the pizza, its a great thin slice, I could bang down 2 pies.

I'd like to start off by saying it is really really good pizza. The cheese is delicious! the place is small and quite crowded. I went during a weekday maybe like around 2pmish and I was able to find seating right next to Vince Vaughn's picture. Good luck finding room on any other given time. Back to the point, the pizza here is like no other (or I could just be thinking that since I am from California), but seriously its worth the trip.

Thought there was a bunch of hype and that it might be a bit touristy, but I was wrong, and I hate admitting that I'm wrong.  Great idea to stuff yourself with pizza and then walk over the Brooklyn Bridge back into Manhattan.  You have to get the Brooklyn Lager which pairs well with the massive pizza that you don't think you'll finish, but you do.  You just cannot stop eating it.  Basic pizza with fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil $12-14, additional toppings $2-$4 each.  AMAZING.  Also, super friendly and charming owner.  What a delight!!", "author": "Michelle B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-09", "description": "Grimaldi's.  It's an institution.  And that's the problem.\n\nI would like to start out by saying that I have eaten divine pizza at this bare-bones beer and pizza joint.  But I ate that pizza at an odd time, before it really got busy.  If you are interested in eating here at a regular time, say 8-10 pm, Wed through Sat, good luck.  Last time I tried to eat here, there was a line about 100 people long (no joke) and they were all from the tourist buses that were parked down the street.  I waited 15 minutes, moved about 5 feet in line, and then quickly left to get to Sam's before that closed.  Sam's is great by the way.  \n\nThe problem with Grimaldi's is not just the wait; it's that when there is a wait, you can be assured that you will be hustled in, hustled out, and that your pizza will be undercooked.  This has happened to me on more than one occasion, and is the real reason I give such a low rating for this institution.  Let's face it, NYers are used to long waits, but a long wait conbined with terrible food is just not a good idea.  Go to Sam's instead.  \n\nOh yeah, and the door guy's terrible attitude that night didn't help either.", "author": "Adam N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-29", "description": "We came here on Saturday at 4 pm thinking we would beat the dinner crowd but were clearly wrong. The wait was an hour and 20 minutes. The 3 of us ordered two large pies (1 plain and one with half mushrooms and half sun dried tomatoes). The sun dried tomatoes were a hit as was the plain pizza. We left 2 slices of the mushroom pie even though we weren't filled up. Their tartufo is incredible. It was better than some that I had in Italy! In my opinion Grimaldi's is only worth an hour plus wait for a one time experience. I would never wait that long again but I had to do it once to see what all the hype was about.", "author": "Chrissy D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-16", "description": "We arrived at 12 PM. We arrived partially hungry and with enough to do to kill the time. Shockingly, we were seated in under an hour. By this time, I was not hypoglycemic but I was at the peak level of hunger about thirty minutes before hypoglycemia. In other words, the ideal level of hunger. We were seated at a table for ten, except the eight other seats were occupied and by strangers, all of whom preceded us on line. Holy. Deliciousness. Almost in a pleasant contrast to Di Fara's, this lack of a uniform distribution of cheese sauce was kind of fun actually. In fact, the whole crowded and rushed experience is the opposite of the calm and relaxing experience at Di Fara's. Thin and crispy but not burnt. Perfect crust. As perfect a pizza as there is. I demolished my half of the large pizza in just a few minutes. We did everything short of licking the pizza pan clean. And our neighbors' pizza pan clean. We debated a second pizza. Any time you debate a second pizza in one sitting, that's the highest of compliments. Grimaldi's should be on any list involving Things to Do, New York, Pizza, or all of the above. In fact, I'd even consider it on a list of baby names.", "author": "Jeff M."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Grimaldi\u2019s Pizzeria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "1 Front St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWKNFR58TIuA7M25dqj9rQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584300"}
