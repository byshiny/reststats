He suggested Ignazio's and since he was buying off we went. I'll get to the pizza review in a moment, but first.....\n\nAs we were entering the restaurant two women with baby strollers were exiting the restaurant and a man who looked like Bob Ross (the TV painting instructor) was holding open the inside door and TOLD me to let the women out first so I held the outside door until they left. As I was entering the premises he stopped me and in a rude and brusk manner while looking at the camera in my hand told me I was not allowed to take photographs in the restaurant. I asked if he was the manager and resentfully told me he was the owner. I assured him I was only there to eat and would like a table. He told us to wait a minute then showed us to a table. And there we sat, a busboy put some plates and silverware in front of us but no menus. He said a waiter would be right with us, we waited some more. Finally a waiter came over and asked us what we wanted, without ever seeing a menu. My client knew what he wanted and placed our order. But I still would have like to have seen a menu. Rude greeting by owner -1 star, no menus or proper greeting by waiter also -1 star. Now on to the pizza.....\n\nI was really surprised by the pie. It was a margarita pizza and it looked perfectly cooked, we had asked for it to be slightly well done and it was. My first impression when picking up a slice was that it was well done as we asked and the slice did not droop. The crust was perfectly cooked with the right amount of \"tooth\". Flaky with a good flavor. The sauce was not too sweet with just the right amount of tang. The mozzarella was right on point flavorful and properly melted the fresh basil was also very good.\n\nIf I lived in the area I could see this as being my go to pizza joint but as I've read on other Yelp reviews, and I quote, \"The staff was extremely rude and disinterested and this completely took away from the experience.\" After my encounter with the owner I would agree. Remember a fish stinks from the head down. It's also cash only!! So if you decide to try Ignazio's your results may differ, you have been warned.

Well there was this place and one other that was popular, and on a hunch we chose Ignazio's. We are so glad we did! \n\nThe pizza was out of this world amazing! If I remember correctly we had two different pies, but I only remember The Pizza. That is actually what it is called, and justly so! Once you've had this pizza you too will refer to it as \"The Pizza\". It was fresh mozzarella, italian plum tomato, pecorino romano, basil, select oregano \u0026 olive oil. Absolute perfection!\n\nMy family also ordered their stuffed artichokes, and the ricotta in them was the perfect consistency. \n\nIt's a small little restaurant, but absolutely amazing! You must try this place if you find yourself on this side of the bridge.", "author": "Jennifer H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-03", "description": "This is a great summer pizza spot. I was kind of skeptical since it is so close to the Brooklyn Bridge I thought it might be touristy. The line to sit down was long so we got a take out instead. Maybe it was because it was so nice to sit outside in the grass at the park eating pizza but that thin crust is one of my favorites.", "author": "Brittany N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-25", "description": "This place has one of the best locations in Dumbo, but it is managed very poorly. I'm guessing the owner is the man holding people up at the door, but micro managing the staff and patrons. He actually asked people to move their seats at the bar to squeeze more people in. I was also seated right by the door, which the owner kept leaving open while people were coming in to prevent them from coming in if they had no tables, but the cold breeze was less than comfortable.\n\nOn top of that, this place is cash only and the ATM they have inside has a $3.75 fee. For one large pizza and 2 sangria's, spending $70 was a bit much for my liking. \n\nThe pizza and sangria were decent, but not amazing and not in my mind worth 70 and an extra 7 in ATM fees.\n\nBecause of the great location, this was a place I wanted to check out, but I won't be back.", "author": "Bethany S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-05", "description": "The wings were banging!

With Grimaldi's and Juliana's around the corner, boasting unnecessarily huge lines, this is a hidden gem down right down the block with comparable pizza. The pizza is thin, crispy, and very tasty.

Worst experience ever! I can't express enough how disturbing my experience was ,first the food was overly priced for the quality ! It was not Italian in any shape or form ! There is no way that there is an Italian chef in that kitchen ! Disgrace ! \nI advice everyone to stay away from this place . Second it was freezing we couldn't even drink or finish our food . I asked three different servers to lower the ac a bit . For gods sake the chandelier-was swaying to and fro that's how strong the air was blowing . No one cared! I finally asked for our food to be wrapped up and we left . I truly wanted to leave the food there but I felt bad that we had to actually pay money for this awful experience ! \nI regret going here in every way ! But it's a lesson learned the only reason we stopped here is because Carmine's had a two hour wait ! I learners next time I'll wait! Carmines is a great pizza place a worth every penny !

Spacious, clean and cheerful. Good place to take a date. Decor? Charming. However, the pizza ...is ~not at all~ exciting. Its almost hilarious how lackluster the taste is. It was so underwhelming that--considering the posh surroundings--I wanted to bust out laughing. \n\nEverything was a write-off. Cheese, crust, toppings, sauce. All bland. All unmemorable. No better than you'd find at the dinkiest little corner pizza stand in say, Hoboken. Or even, Iowa. In fact, I'm not sure I haven't had better pizza at a 7-11. Oddly enough, it also seems to be staffed by Mexicans. \n\nIts bewildering, with Julianna's and Grimaldi's just steps away--how can this place not step up its game and compete? This whole block of Old Fulton Ave is all about alluring, trendy, 'glam' pizza. That is the 'program' on this block. Here under the Brooklyn Bridge, its all about dumb tourists and lines of schmucks stretching around the sidewalk and friggin' velvet ropes and \"maitre de\" service. \n\nIgnazio's wants to be a part of this, so how hard is it to make the utterly simplest dish in New York, by which I mean classic thin crust New York pizza? Apparently its too difficult for Ignazio's. \n\nNow for the kicker: EXPENSIVE. Embarrassing prices. Exorbitant. I would be ashamed to tell you how much I paid for this pizza. I'd be ashamed to tell anyone. That is the only thing \"classic New York\" about this place--the boosted charge. Hype FAIL. \n\nAcross the street is Luke's Lobster.
