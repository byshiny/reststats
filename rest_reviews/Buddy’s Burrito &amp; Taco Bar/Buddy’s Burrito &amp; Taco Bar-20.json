That's some quality steak in a quality burrito and for a bargain. The burrito was huge and every nook and cranny was filled. The beans, rice, steak and cheese melted together perfectly. Topped with the salsas they give you, I just drooled a little writing this review. Seriously stop by for a quick lunch break, order and take it to go. Shoot, order 2 and save one for later. Everyone compares the smaller shops to Chipotle but I like both. Buddy's burritos are definitely softer and has a more melt in your mouth feel. I enjoyed every last bite of my burrito.", "author": "John T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-24", "description": "Do yourself a favor and try their fish tacos.

Also, an unexpectedly good place to get a burger.", "author": "Brooklyn B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-24", "description": "My favorite Mexican spot in the area. Order at counter, they'll prepare your order and you pick up at the other end. Set up like Chipotle, but Buddy's has better food in terms of quality, taste, and portion. \n\nI usually go for the various burritos they have on offer. Regardless of your choice, the burrito will be stuffed with freshly grilled meat of choice, guacamole, salsa, and shredded cheese yet well wrapped (I always hold on the beans). Since the burrito is void of the usual carb fillers (rice, beans), meat is packed in. The burrito will also be longer than the provided plate. \n\nI randomly had the spinach quesadilla once, will eat again. Usually not a fan of quesadilla, but do like spinach rolls and such. The spinach is well seasoned and saut\u00e9ed, wrapped alongside with cheese, was a joy to eat. \n\nNever had the tacos and oddly enough, the guacamole with chips. I guess it's because I'm fixated on their nachos if I'm craving chips. The nachos are definitely layered with ingredients, not just topped. Also nachos are most definitely entr\u00e9e sized, not appetizer sized. \n\nService is friendly, only interacted with cashier though. Sauces are available at pick up area and some hot sauces are located on tables. However the place is a bit dingy, which I usually don't mind, but it's dingy in a dirty kind of way. Like sticky floor, tables had only been wiped with water in its entire lifetime kind of way. Don't let that turn you away though.", "author": "Leo C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-08", "description": "Definitely visit this place when you're craving a real char-grilled steak burrito. Not that bs stuff you get from the chain burrito spots. This place is legit and for the price, there is no comparison. The amount you pay here vs like chipotle or w/e will probably get you twice as much meat of higher quality and extra guac is only like 1 dollar more.\n\nThere is no telling how long this place will stay in business because the real estate is going up all over Brooklyn. Visit here and enjoy it before we all have to go back to Chipotle out of convenience.", "author": "Kenny Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-25", "description": "Yummy burrito's and they have tasty nachos.

Most of the food on the menu is below $10 and everything is super-sized! The portions are huge and intimidating before you devour it.\nI got the El Grande Burrito with Chicken for approx $9. It was huge, they were very generous with sauce, ingredients, utensils etc.\nWhen we entered, there were merely 2/10 tables filled up, when we began eating, the store ran out of seats. And this was late at night! The store interior is not the best nor the cleanest, but the food is really decent and beyond expectations. \nMy friends loved the quesadillas. The cheese was melted to perfection and it was more flavorful than other places' cheese. The guac was delicious but I realized then I had a slight allergy to avocado LOL!\nI don't think I could come here often since the commute is almost 3 hours, but this place is legit!", "author": "Vincent T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-09", "description": "I ordered a super burrito and it literally fell apart in my hands. It was so poorly wrapped. But my real problem with this place was that I just didn't feel like the burrito was that good. I could have lived with pile of burrito mush had it tasted more flavorful. Mine had way too much sour cream it was really over powering. The salsa also tasted like it had been sitting out. Maybe I'm being a little harsh because I'm from California and tend to have high standards for Mexican food, but I honestly feel like I would have been better off going to Chipotle.", "author": "Shelly P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-28", "description": "Savory tacos, a lot of flavor.

I made very clear that I had a tomato allergy, checking if the guacamole had tomatoes and asking for no salsa/pico de gallo. When I picked up my burrito, I again asked to make sure there were no tomatoes. Of course, I get home and there are chunks of tomato in the rice. I called and told them what happened. He knew I had asked for tomatoes and said \"maybe the rice had tomatoes, I don't know\" which is 100% unacceptable when dealing with allergies. There was no apology and it was treated as if this was a flippant situation. Luckily my allergy is not life threatening but this could have been for someone else. I would give negative stars if I could because food safety is most important, which Buddy clearly disregards.", "author": "Liz P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-17", "description": "Best Burrito bar in Brooklyn and possibly NYC.

My husband and I split an El Grande with extra meat and are both super full at the end for about $10.  It even comes with guac. If you like spicy food I highly recommend using their house made hot sauces on whatever you order. Their grilled meats are all great and I'm also a fan of their super vegetarian burrito.
