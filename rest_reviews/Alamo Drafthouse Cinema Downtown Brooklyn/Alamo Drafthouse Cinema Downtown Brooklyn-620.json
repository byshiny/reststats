The cookies we got for desert were more like cake freshly baked.  They adhere to a policy of no talking to make up for the noise of the food I was cheering after each musical number so I was given a warning  They warn you once and if they have to warn you again you will be thrown out without a refund Consider yourself warned Great place for birthdays prices of food are reasonable", "author": "Stacey A."}], "servesCuisine": "Dinner Theater", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Alamo Drafthouse Cinema Downtown Brooklyn", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "445 Albee Square West\nSuite 4-400", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XDQU6A6-23hjoLqoPD6Qaw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185132547"}
