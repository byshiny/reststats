How have I never heard of this place? How good was it? Let's just say that I scolded my husband in the restaurant for knowing of this place and never bring me here. The family dining next to us have been long time patrons, and appreciated this sentiment. \n\nThis restaurant is known for its wild game menu (the reason why my husband didn't think I would like the place). However, they have so many other options on the menu. Everything coming out smelled great. I had the spiced walnut crusted chicken with autumn fruit compote. I wasn't sure if they could pull this off. It was sensational. It was so flavorful. The texture was great. The sweet fruit with the savory nutty chicken made such a great team. I was extremely happy. I also ordered the side of mashed parsnips. Holy crap!! They were outstanding. This has been missing from my life for too long. I need to make this. My husband ordered the buffalo hangar steak with truffle fries. The fries were just ok. Nothing special. The steak was really good. I liked the sauce. Every dish come with a side of steamed broccoli and rice. It comes out about 10 minutes after your meal has arrived, but who's complaining? When we were unsure of the type of red wine we wanted, the waiter brought us samples of 2 types. That was great. We had the mud pie for dessert. It wasn't anything special. It was sort of like the Carvel birthday cakes. That's fine (who doesn't love the crunchies?), but it wasn't different. \n\nOverall, the place gets cramped, and packed if you're not in by 6. Fortunately, the early darkness in winter threw us off, and we thought it was later when we went in. This helped us get a table right away. Within 15 minutes however, people were being turned away. There was a waitress there who is pretty batty, and all over the place. I liked her. Reminded me of the good ol days of Brooklyn, before snarky hipster waiters and waitresses covered in ironic tattoos, started serving in restaurants until their art career takes off. I prefer the career waitresses of yesteryear. This restaurants screams real Brooklyn. It has a loyal following of longtime patrons. It actually reminds me of the kind of old time, exposed brick, quaint Brooklyn eatery that many new restaurateurs attempt to recreate, but fall short. One cannot simply put kitchy gold lettering in a window, with curtains, and old street signs, and assume they have a winning restaurant. This is the real deal. Not pretentious. Not trying to be something it's not. It's the O.G. of small Brooklyn eateries. We will be loyal patrons long after the Brooklyn trend has disappeared.", "author": "R A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-17", "description": "Lot's of options of meats, delicious fish and shrimp, good wine options- love this place!", "author": "Saba F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-12", "description": "Henry's End is the special-occasion place for my girlfriend and me.

Mostly because I love goat cheese and the crispy pistachio crust was to die for. The Ozark short ribs were mouth watering delicious!\n\nHere is where it fell short - the wild boar ragout was not what I expected. It to be topped over a truffle polenta. The truffle polenta was the size a small ice cream scoop and it tasted like plain and bland polenta (where is the truffle flavor)? The ragout itself was ok. Not mind blowing. Soupier than I expected. The Wild game sampler also fell short. The Elk was overpowered by the mustard. \n\nI've been here only once, and the regular menu items were great (salad and ribs) but the wild game menu was a sore disappointment. I'd come back here, but probably wouldn't order anything from the wild game menu.", "author": "Olivia P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-31", "description": "My favourite restaurant in the whole world for 15 years. Not a bad point in the space. Mark Lamm has created something absolutely incredible, and keeping his staff so long (Bonnie!, Albert! Ed(!!) ) is proof positive of a great environment.

I have a Gluten intolerance but can still find something on a menu - especially with a little help from the waitstaff and/or the chef.  I asked about the preparation of a dish which turned out would not be good for me and the waiter had NO interest in making another suggestion or asking the chef (other restaurants have been amazing). I know my gluten issue is not the waiters problem but if the waiter at least makes an effort to help me find something to eat, I will tip bigger, refer them to others and write a nice review.  NOT the case here.  I settled for  grilled chicken ceasar (without croutons) because I felt like I was inconveniencing the waiter by even asking. \n\nIt sucks to have a food issue (this is new for me) but it sucks more to have wait staff that have no interest in making their customers dining experience a nice experience.\n\nWith all of the people who have different food allergies and issues; resaturanteurs, wait staff and chefs should educate themselves and be able to make everyone's dining experience a pleasant one.", "author": "Laura A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-26", "description": "I truly enjoy dining at this \"feel at home\" intimate restaurant with soft lighting and quiet reserved table conversations.  The service is wonderful and the food is fantastic.  I tried the fried chicken with mashed potatoes.  Amazing!  My brother frequents this restaurant (for about 10 years now), and he loves the Lobster Ravioli, Lamb, Soft Shell Crabs.  They have an excellent wine list, and this is a great place for a first date or just to catch up on time missed with old friends.

I appreciated the person who bust my table, he got $6.. now the food.. it was good.. my mom ordered the duck, which was soo fatty.. which was weird.. she didn't love it. I got the lamb which was great.. the shrimp n guac was amazing though. Amazing. my dessert. OMG. O.M.G. the 21 layer crepe is to die for. it has to be the best thing on the earth. so food overall is a 4.6ishh.. that service def dropped it to a solid 3, but that dessert brought it up to a 4..", "author": "Toya H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-02", "description": "I am really confused.  Rarely do I feel like Yelp totally led me astray as much as I do in this case.\n\nI went here with a group of 5 last night, excited by the solid 4 star average among 100+ reviewers who generally expressed that this place was a gem.  But... this place was far from a gem.\n\nThe decor is simple and casual -- but I expected that, so I'm not deducting any points.  What fell short, or flat, was the food.  It really wasn't very good *at all*.\n\nAmong the table we got the penne with butternut squash and anchovies (good, not great, too peppery and kind of greasy), the tuna tartare (verdict was \"fine\"), the Ozark ribs (good but nothing mind-blowing), and the pistachio crusted goat cheese salad (good, but standard fare almost anywhere... fine.)\n\nFor entrees, I got the duckling with wild mushroom lingonberry sauce -- a dish which the waitress told me was her personal favorite and, she thought, the best thing on the menu.  Verdict:  this was soooo uninteresting. It was all savory and rich with no nuance, no subtlety, no real flavor... It was sad.  and the portion was HUGE, a whole side of duck, an almost unappetizingly large portion -- they deliver you a whole plate just saturated in brown gravy. It was not appealing looking, or tasting.\n\nAround the table, people had: sole citron, salmon morrocan, the honey/ginger duckling and the steak diane.  The salmon was picked at and basically left on the plate, the sole was politely described as fine and my husband said the steak was something he thought he could make himself (except if he'd made it, the steak wouldn't be as tough.)\n\nBesides flavors, there is absolutely zero presentation when it comes to the food.  All the dishes come with the same sides: rice pilaf and vegetable of the day (in our case green beans) which were served on a smaller side plate.  The main dishes are served on large plates, heaping with sauce, with no attention to plating or attractiveness.  Anything with a sauce was basically drenched in it to the point that the food was no longer recognizable (this was true for 3 of the 5 dishes on our table).  \n\nThe most damning note, as we walked out the door my husband whispered in my ear: \"Let's not go back there.\"\n\nAnd, sadly, I don't think we will.", "author": "Katie Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-18", "description": "To be brief.

Also, his mom complimented the owner on the way out on the excellent coffee - so there's that too.\n\nTwo things to note: it's really loud and really hot in the restaurant.
