Portions are relatively small compared to what you would get at other Asian shops. \n\nThe soup dumplings are great for the neighborhood, but not among the best in the NY area; overall great serviceable for a neighborhood spot. The spicy soup dumplings probably use a mix with paprika, and reminds me of spicy Doritos. Many of the rice dishes are average and serviceable with the exception of the meatballs, which are great. I just wish I can get more of it per order. \n\nThe cold noodles are on the greasier side. \n\nI have not tried the other appetizers, but they could be the standouts on the menu. \n\nThis restaurant is well covered by many of the delivery services in NY.", "author": "Quincy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-25", "description": "Great new addition to the neighborhood.

Thank god we've got some decent Shanghainese food in downtown BK. The food is tasty. It ain't Chinatown, but it's the best we've got. Definitely too expensive for what you get (small portions), but it's good quality. I wish the seats had backs, but otherwise it's easy to find a spot to sit.

We got the chicken curry rice, the beef noodle soup, the ma po tofu, and the Chinese greens (currently gai lan - Chinese broccoli). The chicken curry was sweet, the fried egg was precooked and COLD, the beef noodle soup was ok but the noodles were too soft and not Q (chewy) and the beef was dry and there was a tendon that wasn't cooked long enough so it was tough and inedible, and everything was way too salty. I still think everything we had yesterday was fantastic, so I would come here and stick to the left side of the top row of the menu. Honestly, if we weren't in Brooklyn for a convention and within walking distance of this place, I would go to Joe's in Chinatown (the Shanghainese restaurant of my childhood). I know it's a tourist trap and there's a line down the street, but it's still there decades later for a REASON and there's a line down the street for a REASON. (Do NOT go to the Joe's in Midtown -- YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED) (the one in Queens is not as good as the original either).", "author": "Ataru N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-20", "description": "Loved the curry noodles!

No, it's not Chinatown or Bay Ridge but for the area they are pretty darn good.

They have a great selection of Shanghainese food, including one of my favorites of all time, soup dumplings! I also love the chicken curry crispy noodles and the Shanghai cold noodle.

The prices are reasonable, and it's a great location, but I found the food to be just okay. I had the soup dumplings, the crab pork dumplings, and vegetables over crispy noodles. \nThe meat in the pork dumplings was delicious, but the soup inside was so-so. \nCrab pork dumplings were good.

I enjoyed the sesame noodles more since they weren't as salty and the noodles were chewier. Definitely try the handpulled noodles. I also had the veggie dumplings and they weren't bad but you pay more than Chinatown prices for only 4 in a bamboo steamer.

The portions are very big and filling. Good quality meat. The chicken is clean cut chicken with no nerves. \nOn different occasions, I've tried the chicken curry on rice and eggs, the pan fried buns, and the braised pork meat balls soup. All three were very good and filling. \nI also tried the soup dumplings for the first time; the eyes of the staff were on me, curious to see how I would handle the mission of eating these juicy treats. I ended up eating them with my bare hands. \nThe soup dumplings were delicious and I provided free entertainment to the staff. They are tricky to eat with chopsticks, so I picked them up, bit the top off, and drank the broth off them. Then I popped the rest of the dumpling in my mouth. I'm pretty sure that's not how you eat them. They were amazing. \nYou could split in half one order and feel just fine. The appetizers are conspicuous too, and they may make up a meal. \nIt is reasonable priced. They do not serve tea or coffee...just soda and water. I like to take out because my house is very close and I do not feel like always drinking soda.\nService is very nice and the menu is easy to navigate. They offer few items, but they are cooked great.", "author": "Dullua C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-09", "description": "Best Chinese restaurant I have been to in NYC!

Unsure if it's a match for the soup dumplings at Joe's Shanghai, which were heretofore my favorite, but they left absolutely nothing to be desired: adequately soupy and flavorful, with unique flavors between the pork and crab options, which is rare in soup dumplings. The buns too were incredibly juicy and delicious.
