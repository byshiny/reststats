Came here after being turned away from posh gran electrica (they were closed for a wedding)...was very disappointed and hungry until I stumbled upon Pedro's...Very cool hole in the wall dive bar kinda vibe. They make you fresh margaritas (tequila, lime, grand marnier)  if you ask. Also had tofu burrito option. Cool ambiance great service.", "author": "Melissa C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-20", "description": "Terrible service, terrible service. My gf ordered a Sauza with Seltzer and they brought her just Selzter. By the time we got their attention 20 minutes later the ice was melted and they just put the Sauza in with more Seltzer and it was all watered down. When the food eventually came the veggie burrito I ordered had chicken in it. They swapped it out after a long wait. We had to ask for water 6 times before we got any. They did apologize though. The vibe in there is awesome, the food was OK but for the money not great. We were really disappointed with the service.", "author": "Dima K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-23", "description": "I have come here about 4 or 5 times and I have never been disappointed.\n\nI usually get the tacos dorado (3) all in chicken with everything on it.

Full bar, great margaritas-which they serve in Mason jars (How cute is that?)! I came here and had a tofu burrito with rice and beans-good overall, with my favorite part being the well seasoned tofu and some delicious guacamole.

The building looks like the last relic standing from DUMBO past.\n\nI chuckled when I walked in and saw Christmas lights sloppily strewn around the interior, and heard the campy music playing.

The place is small so expect a wait, ours was only 5 mins to get a seat at the bar.  We decided on a pitcher of sangria since it made a lot of sense economically.  I was disappointed to see that the sangria wasn't something homemade but instead was just something he poured out of a jug of Carlo Rossi, they didn't even throw in some fruit to pretend it was homemade, no bueno.  We didn't have any food, just the sangria, oh and I had a margarita after seeing him pour the tequila for someone else's, it just spoke to me.  Yea my eyes didn't fool me, that was a strong margarita, 2 of those and I would've been set but it wasn't that kinda night", "author": "Samantha U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-10", "description": "Being the only Mexican restaurant in DUMBO, Pedro's can afford to serve overpriced, mediocre Mexican food, with terrible service, and still have people come through the doors each day.

Went there today with a friend who\nis allergic to really hot food. She asked for a quesadilla on the  mild side-well that's not what she got. She took two bites and realized that the server totally forgot what she told her two seconds after she took the order. She had informed the server that she gets really sick from hot food and the server replied \"we wouldn't want that to happen.\"\n  When my friend realized she couldn't finish her food we switched dishes. She informed the server that she gave her hot food and reminded her that it was not what she wanted. The server didn't even apologize and walked away mumbling to herself.  I encouraged my friend to speak with the manager who offered a piece of flan for our \"inconvenience\".\nWe turned this down and paid the check-needless to say the server was left with  no tip.  My friend ended up a bad allergic reaction eyes got puffy and swollen and\nhad to take benedryl.  \n I tried to get my friend to go back to Pedros to show the manager her swollen eyes, however, she felt that withholding a tip was suffice. I didn't and that's why I wrote this review. If I could give this dump a   minus 5 stars I would, I can only give it a \nwarning label-\"EAT HERE WITH CAUTION\".", "author": "Tina R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-05", "description": "I went here with my b/f and two other friends of ours last night, partly because it was one of the few places open (It was July 4th, so a lot of places had closed up for the day). We all enjoy Mexican food, so we decided it was worth a shot to try.\n\nWe got seated in a table in the back, next to the A/C unit and a very loud fan. After several minutes, we finally got a waitress that took our drink orders. The drinks were decent enough, but nothing to write home about.\n\nAfter several more minutes, we order our food. The first thing to come is the Super Nachos ($13). They were decent enough, but a very small portion for the price. I mean we are talking about chips, beans, cheese, and peppers people.\n\nNow onto the main courses. I ordered the fish tacos, and it took her three tries to actually deliver the correct meal to me. First I got veggie tacos, then I got chicken ones, and finally got (lukewarm) fish tacos. \n\nThe fact that the A/C was directly above us made it so that the food almost instantly got cold. It just made for an unpleasant dining experience. Our one friend who did order veggie tacos didn't get his meal until almost 10 min after everyone else, and then they shorted him one taco.\n\nAt the end, I went up to talk to the manager / owner. She made it like she really didn't care that we had a bad experience, and basically had the attitude that if we never came back it would not matter to her. That sealed it for me. I let my b/f deal with the check and we left, having given the waitress a 5% tip (I wanted to leave her nothing).\n\nSo the moral of this review, STAY AWAY. There are much better Mexican restaurants, and if this is your only choice while in DUMBO, I'd say going hungry is a better option.", "author": "George S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-05-13", "description": "Vegetarian burrito is pretty boring.

There seemed to be more people eating here than anywhere else, so we gave it a try. \n\nI agree with others that inside is small and cramped with a low ceiling, so sit outside if possible. I had no problem with the waitstaff, all the ladies were friendly, accommodating, and attentive. \n\nThe margaritas were good nothing to write home about. I thought the nachos were good. I would not get the plantains again. My quesadilla was also solid. The food is filling and I wouldn't plan on doing much after eating here. \n\nSolid place if you are in the neighborhood and looking for good, cheap food.

Let's just say I expected more for that money. I had a chicken burrito, good size, and a little side of guacamole. My boyfriend had Tacos Combo, if i remember correctly, and ended up ordering Tamale because he wasn't even close to full. This cost us 25.5 $, which is way overpriced for this food. I found hard pieces in my burrito, not sure what that was. The guacamole tasted fine, but it sure wasn't fresh, like some puree that came out of a jar. And my boyfriend's tamale seemed microwaved and some insides were still cold. Come on, 25.5$? It all tasted OK, nothing special. For 25 bucks, not really.", "author": "Cristal G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-24", "description": "Went there this past Saturday and sat at a table outside.  The service was terrible as our waitress was too busy entertaining her friends at another table rather than tending to her other patrons.  After waiting 45 minutes for a pitcher of sangria and some empanadas, we get one of most bland concoctions ever with no fruit in sight so we immediately complain.  We were told that the sangria is straight from the store bought bottle and not freshly made so there should be nothing wrong with it. Hello?  If you pay $25 for a picture of sangria, you don't expect to get the best ingredients but you do expect it to be freshly made like most restaurants in NYC. \n\nBesides the watered down drink, we also purchased the aforementioned empanadas in chicken, pork, and beef.  After waiting an extra 10 minutes for silverware and plates, which never came, we decided to dig in hands first.  Truthfully I couldn't tell one meat from another.  Everything was ground to a pulp and overcooked so it had that mystery meat feel.  I got flashbacks to school lunches in the 80s.  Yuck. \n\nFinally we skipped the sangria, paid for the mystery meat empanadas - with no tip, and walked to a real restaurant down the street.  I don't see how this restaurant can survive the change in the area without improving.
