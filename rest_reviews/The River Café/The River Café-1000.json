Fois gras, Oysters, Duck, Rack of Lamb and Lobsters more than perfect, along with little tastings and exquisite desserts.   Service, as its reputation, kind and attentive.  View much more striking in person than in pictures.  Put this place on your list of must do.

The view is spectacular and the food is even better... my Chilean sea bass was like a cloud, the foie gras was incredible, and the tastes that I had of everyone else's food were equally outstanding. The only dish we weren't wild about was the salmon, but it was definitely cooked to perfection if a bit uninspired. Service was impeccable and we will definitely be returning!", "author": "Benjamin K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-02", "description": "This place is incredible!  Came here for our 1 year anniversary and it just doesn't get any better.  The food quality, attention to detail and service were unparalleled, and I've eaten at a lot of nice places.  I had the steak tartare and NY steak and my lady had the mango lobster and maine lobster meals.  Both appetizers and entrees were AMAZING.  I can't stress how expertly prepared the food was.  The steak was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and it had a very rich taste.  The lobster was perfectly cooked as well.  The drinks were great, the view was superb and the desserts were awesome as well.  We'll definitely be coming back here.  Bonus: it was not a stuffy place, it was actually very fun and lively!", "author": "Vick S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-06", "description": "This place is exactly what all the other 5 star reviews say it is: delicious food, impeccable service, and million dollar views. It took a month to get a reservation on a Saturday. We sat in the main dining room with straight-on views of the Manhattan skyline, although this forced us to engage in the dreaded same-side seating.  Started with some prosecco ($11/glass) and also ordered a bottle of chardonnay. We got the cheap stuff ($36 bottle), but their wine list is comprehensive (and includes $10,000 bottles; we declined). We got the chef's tasting menu ($125/person), which included: scallop ceviche, rock lobster tails with mango jelly, branzino, foie gras, steak, and desert. All of it was delicious and proportioned perfectly. We gorged ourselves on chocolate for desert. Also had the goat cheese cheesecake.  If you don't want the tasting menu, $100 will get you a 3 course dinner. The service was great - formal but not stuffy; attentive but not overbearing. The restaurant is also pretty tightly packed with tables and people, but arranged in such a way that you're not overhearing everyone else's conversation. Great for a date.", "author": "Nathan H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-10", "description": "Magical, romantic, expensive.\nGo there every year with my husband for our anniversary and fall in fall in love with it every time, especially the lobby area with all the flowers. Every now and then, a girl needs a reason to wear a nice dress with nice jewelry, but now with the recession, i have noticed them toning down a bit.\nThe food is wonderful and i am yet to be discouraged by waiter's suggestions. However, this will hit your pocketbook, hard. $300 on average. So the best time to go is lunch or restaurant week", "author": "Irene G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-02", "description": "The restaurant is a pretty place with beautiful flowers but our waiter was lackluster and didn't re-pour our wine or water when our glasses were empty and never offered us bread. We assume he didn't care b/c he was going to get a 20% tip regardless of his service. My husband and I ordered the amish chicken and it was a nice presentation but didn't wow us. I wish I had ordered the steak. My sister had the seabass and enjoyed it. My brother in law had the salmon and loved it and my mother and other sister had the shellfish duo which had a crabcake and shrimp. They both liked theirs. We split 3 desserts between the 6 of us. The chocolate brooklyn bridge which is a great presentation, the sticky toffee and the apple tart. We enjoyed them but none of them knocked our socks off. I would say this is a restaurant to go to once but I wouldn't care to return.", "author": "Emily A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-25", "description": "Pricey but well worth it :) All the view Giando has with out the crappy service.

It was, in fact, as good as all of the reviews. We took a cab there, so the commute is really easy. The view is amazing as the restaurant is right on the river. The holiday called for a $125 price fixe. I got the turkey with the typical sides, all done with slight twists. Everything was wonderful, including our wine - we got one of the cheaper bottles on the menu (around $70, i think) and it was great. The only bad thing I had was my desert: a pumpkin pie that was prepared very creme brulee-like. Very disappointing. \n\nIt is definitely expensive - around $200 per person and not a lively/fun type of place. Great place for special occasions but I would never be able to justify the cost for a typical dinner out.", "author": "D.

It was scary expensive but quite literally the best dining experience I've ever had.  From the seamless service to the beautiful plating and delicious food...it was seriously perfect.  I would take a bite of my lovely warm roll and the next time I would look down there was a new lovely warm roll...what the?  I thought I was going crazy but they are like The Flash...the only evidence of their presence being a shiny new fork or a new tray of butter.  The view is stunning.  The whole meal feels like you are on a cloud somewhere.  I haven't been back but this would be a wonderful romantic dinner for a special occassion (one wonders how many rings have been hidden in cakes and puddings there) but it would be a great place to take visiting parents who get a beautiful NYC experience...(and hopefully pick up the tab).  It is a prix fixe so at least you know the damage right off the bat.  The dessert that is a chocolate Brooklyn Bridge is a nice touch.  A must NY dining experience.
