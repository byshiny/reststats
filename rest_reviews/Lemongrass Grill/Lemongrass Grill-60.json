Today is the second time they completely dropped the ball with my meal. My so-called \"sweet and sour\" stir fry was more like bland and bitter. The first time I ate here, they burnt the tofu in my fried rice to the point where all you could taste is an overwhelming burnt taste. Tried to give them another chance but ended up disappointed again. Too many other Thai places in NYC to put up with this crap. Take my advice and go elsewhere!", "author": "Jay H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-03", "description": "Never disappoints!

I've visited 10+ times over the last year. Honestly... it's can be a hit or misses depending on the chef making the food, but mostly hits, I do recommend this place at times.

Lemongrass Thai is one of those Thai places that is authentic and delivers on the taste all the way. I ordered for pick up and the order went smoothly. They packaged it so well and cautiously since I stated I had to travel far. Very accommodating and friendly.\n\nNow on to the food. My chicken pad thai was on point. It hit the spot of my comfort food the night I had it. My husband got their version of drunken noodles and he loved his food as well. The Thai ice tea was good and we got two free ice teas. What a pleasant surprise! There's no question whether I'll be back. Lemongrass Thai is your way to go for some good old authentic thai!", "author": "Amy W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-26", "description": "This restaurant is the best, their customer service is great their prices are also very good.

I'm giving them 3 stars because their customer service could improve. The tables are pretty small so all we asked was for the unused chair to be moved for more leg room and the waiter responds why would you want to move it several times. We have you our reason already.  VOC must not matter too much to them. Got the wonton soup to start and Thai shrimp fried rice with some Thai beer.

Seemingly the decor has not changed since the 2000's. \n\nThe food is ok. The crispy fried duck entree I had was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. The spring rolls were very very fresh, which is a plus in my book, but it didn't quite have that explosion of flavor that I'm used to in Thai cuisine.\n\nOverall I would recommend Lemongrass. It is still some of the best Thai food you can get in Brooklyn.

I got two things here: Crab Rangoons and Basil Fried Rice with Chicken. The fried rice I have no complaints. Filled me up and I was a happy camper. The Crab Rangoons I didn't expected it to be mixed with curry paste and I wasn't a fan of that. I expected it to be just cream cheese as the filling, so I won't be getting those again.\n\nDelivery took about 45min - 1hr. No complaints with the delivery man.

The wings were flavorful; they had the crisp of a fried buffalo wing, without the added calories/fat. The crispy duck pieces were perfection...OMG...the salad? Not so much. It was very salty and very sweet. I poured the dressing into the saucer below the salad bowl and muted the flavors with white rice. That's when I was in my zone...mmmm. Let's have a conversation about the presentation of the Thai fried rice...it comes in a lengthwise hollowed pineapple half. It's fragrant, and brings a great balance of salt and sweet. The Thai Iced tea was VERY sweet. I added about 1/3 glass of water to make it more palatable. My mom said the Thai iced coffee was Delilah as-is. I'll try THAT next time.
