The restaurant is pretty cute and has some nice seating, but the food was lackluster. The falafel was freshly fried and I enjoyed that, but all the other toppings and pita were super bland and the toppings weren't very generous for price. Not sure if this is just a different style of middle Eastern food than I'm used to, but none of the veggies (cabbage, cucumbers, etc) had any seasoning or dressing, they were just raw and chopped up. It ended up being a dry and flavorless platter, made palatable only by the white sauce and highlighted by falafel.", "author": "Natalie H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-22", "description": "I absolutely love this place! Although it's twice the price of the halal food from the trucks, the taste is so much better. The fries were hot and crispy. The pita bread was delicious, especially with the spicy sauce. The hummus was really good as well. They give you a lot so I think it is worth paying extra! Would recommend this place to everyone.", "author": "Rina I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-16", "description": "If your in this area and need good food fast this is the place.

The portions are just right and the food isn't too bland or too salty. It rests perfectly in between. I can't complain about paying $10+ because it's worth every penny.

It's like a Chipotle but Mediterranean style. I wish they had more options. Platters are a bit pricey, $10 for meat and $8 for falafel. Also most of the sandwiches are $8. \nGiving it four stars because of the friendly service and the healthy options.

The chicken was moist and I loved the garlic sauce they put on top of it. It was not your typical tzatziki but something special with a real zing. The salad ingredients were very fresh and the rice was delicious. I left quite satisfied and quite full!

At DK NYC, you essentially choose what protein you would like in either a pita, wrap or a bowel and then you choose your toppings and sauces. I opted for a beef/lamb wrap. The meat was seasoned well without being overbearing or salty.

I grew in the area and realized that the other spot wasn't there anymore. \n\nThe food was amazing - I had a rice bowl w/ Chicken. I've tried a couple other spots with similar bites, but this spot tops them ALL.

If you like food truck but doubt about its sanitary condition, come here to grab your workday lunch!\n\"Doner\" is the \"meat pile\" cooked in the grill rack. For meat, they have lamb\u0026beef combined, and chicken. For protein, you can choose rice or pita bread. \nWhat I really like about this place is their meat. Unlike the cold and hard chicken and lamb from food trucks, their meats are fresh, tasty, and well cooked.\nThe environment is clean with wood table and seat. The server here is very friendly.

I've eaten at more Mediterranean, build your bowl places than I can remember, and while nothing can come close to dear old Roti, this place doesn't disappoint. \n\nYou can get either a wrap (in a pita) or a bowl (with fries or rice), and the bowl costs between $8-$11 and is $2 more expensive than the wrap. I stopped by during the lunch rush but the place wasn't really full, and the line still moved slowly. The staff isn't very organized, and they kept bumping into each other while getting orders, thereby slowing down the process.\n\nI got the chicken doner bowl with rice, ALL of the vegetable toppings (they're really generous with the serving size!), and a splash of both the spicy sauce and the garlic sauce. The chicken was so well sliced, juicy and cut into just the right size. The vegetables weren't all seasoned and were hits and misses. The sumac onions, the pickles, and the onion, tomato, cucumber salad were worthy additions to the bowl but pretty much everything else was just filler. The sauces were A-okay, neither very garlicky nor very spicy. The rice was kind of watery and bland. I skipped the pita. Also, there are no soft drink dispensing machines, only cans which are obviously overpriced.\n\nA healthy, wallet friendly option for lunch!", "author": "Shivani P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-14", "description": "I had beef and lamb doner with rice with all the veggies and both sauces.

They are reasonably priced, you get a good portion of high quality food.  I usually get the lamb and beef bowl with brown rice. Their hot sauce and yogurt sauce are both very good.

Overall I feel like everything was just kind of bland. Mediterranean food is supposed to be packed with flavor and Doner's just isn't.
