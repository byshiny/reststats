Saturday afternoon, plenty of room inside this dimly lit place both at the bar and at the tables.\n\nLarge draft list is written on the chalkboard at the back of the bar, so quickly was able to order an IPA ($7) to go along with some Nachos w/Guac ($15) to start. Nachos are your standard fare - a big pile of chips topped with cheese, peppers, sour cream, guacamole ($ extra), tomatoes, and greens. Cheese could have been better but the cream and guac made up for it. For the main course, ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich ($14); a meaty serving swimming in BBQ sauce, barely staying inside the bun. Fries that come alongside are seasoned well and seemingly handcut.\n\nOverall the food was above average, the draft list is excellent, and the service is quality. Great spot for a low-key afternoon in the area.", "author": "Shaji K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-03-31", "description": "Came here on a Friday night after work and was instantly greeted enthusiastically by the Manager, Michael. Michael provided great conversation and was polite and attentive the entire evening. I drank wine and decided to curb my appetite with an order of wings and a side of brussel sprouts. The wings were served pretty quick after placing my order which was great. What I found was that the wings were fairly large to come out so quick. The wings were glazed in an Asian Zing sauce which was flavorful. Unfortunately, the wings were under cooked which were pretty hard to get through. The Brussel Sprouts however were delicious down to every bite. I would venture to try other selections in the future to see how they measure up. The aesthetic still has the classic feel, which is perfect for those nights for unwinding and catching a game.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-09", "description": "I first discovered Henry Street Ale house when I lived in the neighborhood circa 2007. It's just what you want from any bar-dimly lit, a great draft selection plus a vast menu of yumminess. Though it's 2018 I always feel a bit transported into an old timey NYC when i'm in here. The bar has a bunch of two tops, and some coveted booths in the back. If you're lucky you can snag a table by the windows for people watching. They have a ton of beer on draft here-usually over 18 options. You also can't go wrong with the food menu here. It changes seasonal, but the Shepard's and chicken pot pie, burger and caesar salad are to die for. I used to also love the tuna sandwich which is off and on the menu lately. \n\nService either at the bar is quick and friendly. It's a very local place with a good local crowd. Now that we moved we still make it a point to come back here for old times sake. It's for sure my one of favorite Brooklyn Heights bars.", "author": "Ren\u00e9e G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-14", "description": "Great place to have a local craft beer.

But it's casualness and relaxed vibe is why it's so great. \n\nWe got there at ~8PM on a Thursday night. The bar was almost full but there were plenty of empty seats at the tables. We sat ourselves and received food menus quickly from the waiter. I had a pint of the Harvest Cider (delicious) and ordered the Burrito special at $15.\n\nThis burrito was SO good. Carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and black beans with a side of spicy salsa. It was wrapped and grilled--perfect in every way. My boyfriend got the friend chicken sandwich with fries. The fries are excellent and I thought the fried chicken was solid (nicely complimented by the chipotle mayo). \n\nThis place is a little pricey for what it is but the food is worth it.

We were disappointed when they made the menu a bit too upscale for our tastes, but they are slowly bringing back their old standards. Terrific selection of beers on tap and service is always friendly without being annoying. I'm a huge fan of their chili (though I miss their homemade tortilla chips - those were amazing), burgers, nachos (they did recently return but weren't as good as they originally were), fried chicken sandwich...surprised by the 3.5-star rating.", "author": "Jen O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-20", "description": "I come here all the time. After a month out of NYC I came back, and found to my horror that their lineup has changed. The beer tap list used to be a bunch of craft beers which I was only able to get here, and which was worth biking over the bridge for. I would come here and in one evening taste several beers and drink three I liked. Now half the list is the usual unmemorable stuff: Brooklyn lager, delirium tremens, and, would you believe it, Stella. \n\nI asked the bartender what had happened and they said the management has changed. I really hope they preserve the craft list.", "author": "A S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-16", "description": "My favorite local spot for a quick bite after work.  It's usually not crowded which is to my liking (although it deserves better).  The tap menu is always changing which makes it exciting!  On the food menu the burger is my favorite.  Outside of that almost everything else on the menu I've tried has been delicious.  The bar tenders here are usually really really attentive and are really ON their game!\nOn the more critical side, I wish that there were more full pint pours for all IPAs since they hardly carry high abv brews (9% and beyond).  I'd also like to see a stronger stouts and porters.  I hardly ever see any belgian style stuff, it's mostly on the lighter end of the spectrum!?\nOk, anyway.

Tables are majority non-occupied and standing by the entrance waiting to be greeted by the hostess to be ushered to a seat was a few minutes of being invisible.  An American neighborhood pub located in Brooklyn Heights, typical, with TV screens plastered against the wall for the sport aficionados attaining their daily intake.  With a strong doubt I sensed a strong negative aurora for patronizing this business based on being invisible for several moments and the difficulty of flagging the waiter.  The service is mediocre as my server appears melancholy.  In silent acquiescence, she rose to her feet to place my food order and attain my wine without further ado - without a smile, without any life in her eyes.\n\nQuality of food is MEH.  When inquiring for drink suggestions I was informed we have a full bar, okay in hopes of ordering a frozen drink Henry Street does not have a blender ergo why laid the claim \"we have a full bar\"?! False and misleading information.  They do offer a small selection of brew beers.\n\nC\u00f4tes-du-Rh\u00f4ne-Villages (Rh\u00f4ne Valley, France) $11.00 - subtle finish for red.  I did not taste any oak.  Henry Street's wine glass contains a sharp inside curved ream, perhaps, to prevent spillage.\n\nCaramelized Pecan Brioche bread pudding $7.95 - dessert from the daily Special was very heavy, rich swimming in caramel, ergo, I did not finish.  There is no shortage of pecan nuts embedded within either.  Caramel is a dentist worst nightmare to create immense dental damage.  I was not offered a glass of water upon being seated.  It does not appear that other dessert(s) were available either as a daily special or listed on their food menu.\n\nNote:  No Discover cards are accepted- all other credit/debit cards are accepted.", "author": "Tina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-10", "description": "Friendly service, reasonable prices and tasty comfort food - fish and chips, burgers etc. Fisg was fresh, fries hand cut.

They were perfect.

They must be under new management who aren't from the area as the menu no longer has the affordable and hearty pub fare they were always known for, but items like chicken hearts (!), gizzards (!!!), and over-priced naked hamburgers. They used to have the best chicken pot pie, tasty fish\u0026chips, and a massive burrito, but alas no more. The barbecue pulled pork was another yummy favorite and that's gone too. Also, my husband is a pescatarian, and there's not much left for him to eat there (even their vegetables have meat in them). I did order the fried chicken sandwich last week and it was a sloppy and really delicious treat, though I waited a half-hour for it to arrive.
