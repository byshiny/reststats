Ordered a large pie with sausage (no meatball), pepperoni, garlic, mushrooms, onion. \n\nPros: The cheese they used were really good, can tell it's special home made. \n\nCons: The other ingredients were just so so. Mushrooms were not even fresh. And looooooooooooooooooong wait for eat-in. I went there around 3:30pm which might be the least busy time for all restaurants. However, there were at least 20 people waiting out of the Grimaldi's door for eat-in. \n\nFor takeout, they don't have a hard board box for you. They simply cover the pizza with a large thin paper bag with a hard board paper on the bottom for you to hold your pizza. When I carried that large pie from Brooklyn back to Manhattan, the board paper on the bottom turned to be so soft that I had to use two arms to hold my pizza.\n\nI would say, for meat animals, that's pizzeria isn't for you since their meat isn't so good and they don't even have meatballs. For people living in Manhattan like me, it is not worth a trip to Brooklyn. I would rather go to Lombardi's.", "author": "Vicki Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-21", "description": "A must have for anyone who loves pizza in New York.

However, the pizza is so well crafted that it's fairly (but not completely) worth the wait. \nFirst of all, the dough has been let rise for sufficient time, with traditional yeast -not the instant stuff. You can taste the difference in the crust, as it's flavorful, light and chewy like a fresh loaf of bread. Then there is the matter of the ingredients, all of which are quite fresh and of good quality. Lastly, there is the finished product itself. The pie lacks those disgusting puddles of oil that often accompany pizza made with processed cheeses. So all things considered, a very very good pizza. \nSo why only four stars? Well, the 65 minute wait, crumb infested table cloth and having to share a table with four hefty, sweaty men put me slightly on edge. That being said, the pizza is still one of the best I've ever tasted.\nP.S.

It was sooo good. We got there around 9pm on a Monday night and there was still a line! Luckily it wasn't too bad, less than 30 minutes. We met a couple of Australians in line and we ended up sharing a table with them. We ordered a pizza with pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, and fresh garlic. Mmmm, so this is what NY pizza is supposed to taste like. My girlfriend and I split a small pizza and it was a good portion. The large is huge! Everything on the pizza tasted so fresh from the sauce to the mozzarella cheese that was so stringy.

For me pizza has been done for so many years and by many that there is no excuse for a bad pie. Grimaldis is pizza heaven. Other than the wait outside for 30+ MINUTES, its totally worth it. The menu is simple and straight forward. The prices are extremely cheap for its worth, $12 a small pie. The coal oven taste in your mouth with the perfect crust, sauce and cheese.

I didn't think pizza could taste so excellent until I came here!\nI decided to try this place since I read all the great reviews and saw this place on the food channel. My family and I arrived to a line that was about an hour and a half wait. The man who was letting people in was such a nice man. I am not sure if he was the owner but he let us go in without having to wait since he saw that I had a child and my mom with me.\nThe place inside is small but cozy. At the end of the restaurant you can see the pizza being made. Also the service is excellent and they were so attentive. I asked them what did they recommend and they told me to try the mushroom with sausage pizza. Let me say that the pizza was so delicious. You can taste how fresh the cheese, tomato sauce, and crust is. Omg my mouth is watering just thinking about it. My mom has not wanted to eat pizza since we came back from New York. She says she can not see pizza the same after that, lol!. We all can't wait to go back to New York and have my ultimate favorite pizza.
