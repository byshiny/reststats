Finally one day I was in the area. I bought a slide of tiramisu cheesecake and it was so sweet. I would give it 5/10. I'm a cake lover and cheesecake is my fav but this slice was extremely sweet and too much for me. The slice was also tiny considering it was around $6. But they packaged it very nicely and securely so that's a plus. I'll be back to try some other types.", "author": "Doma G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-15", "description": "My mom wandered in here looking for a treat.  They had a large selection of baked goods, we got a red velvet cupcake and a slice of chocolate cake. It was a tad bit hectic ordering, but these places always are.

Honestly this place is great. Great coffee, cakes, atmosphere. The seating and such makes it a good hang out place. \n\nThings to try:\nLemon Blueberry cake (I think it's called but you can easily decipher it when you go in)\nFruit Napoleon\nCreme Brulee\n\n1 star less because their check-in is misleading.", "author": "Princess S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "Was super excited to see this place pop up in my hood. I'm always down for easy access to pastries!\n\nHave only tried the cream cheese brownie, which was awesome if not a little pricey ($4.50). The space itself, though, is worth a mention. THEY HAVE A GARDEN, hellooooo brunch. And there's just a ton of seating inside. Perhaps good for a birthday party?\n\nPro tip: The coffee spot opens at 6 a.m. NONE of the coffee joints in the neighb open that early, so this is a welcome addition for us early risers.", "author": "Sarah G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-28", "description": "Really great service! There were two people working this night and both were super friendly and sweet. 5 stars.\n\nWe ordered the almond cake and pistachio ice cream. The cake had the right amount of sweetness and lightness to it. I would definitely order it again. \n\nAs for the ice cream, you can taste the nutty flavor in it, and I really liked that this pistachio did not have any green dye added to it. I just felt that it was missing the pistachio flavor. There is another ingredient in the ice cream (maybe toffee?) that may have been overpowering. It still tasted great, but wished the pistachio was more distinct.", "author": "Grace C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-01", "description": "They did a good job keeping the line going. The croissant-donuts were delicious; they have a fluffy, layered texture. The turkey and cheese croissant was also delicious.

I don't like sweets much so coming from someone who isn't a big sweet ester, take my review into account.  My boyfriend and I went in after eating at Kyoto and decided just to look at the selection, it's definitely one of the most diverse selections I've ever seen. They even have a custom tea and cappuccino bar. We decided to partake in the German chocolate slice and chocolate brownie. The chocolate was semi sweet; therefore, it was decadent and I didn't feel nauseous at the end of my slice. Very rich and moist cake that paired well with the dark chocolate. \nBeing that I'm not an avid fan of sweets, I'd have to say that I was so impressed I will definitely come back. Plus, outstanding service as well.", "author": "Monique P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-09", "description": "This place has so many delicious things!!

The boss is so friendly! It was my birthday today and I had asked for recommendations to which cake would be best. He had suggested strawberry cheesecake, but I just couldn't decide! We ended up ordering 6 different type of cakes: strawberry shortcake, tiramisu, chocolate fudge, Napoleon Berry, raspberry peach, and a porcupine! THE BOSS, TONY, WAS SO SWEET AND GAVE ME AN EXTRA STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE BECAUSE IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY AND A GIANT CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE. The porcupine had passion fruit tart inside and it was so dense and amazing .

The staff are always very nice. \n\nThey don't offer free coffee anymore. \n\nAt our first time there, we had blackout cake, apple pie and something I don't remember now and we enjoyed everything. They were Not too sweet like most American style cakes. \n\nThe second time, I got strawberry cheesecake. The cheesecake tasted sort of artificial and I guess I hated the red gel over the strawberries. \n\nI'll definitely go there again and try their other cakes :)", "author": "Dilek T."}], "servesCuisine": "Cafes", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Mia\u2019s Bakery", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "139 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SM4ZOzR354iQi9Xvf1b68g/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+13479873194"}
