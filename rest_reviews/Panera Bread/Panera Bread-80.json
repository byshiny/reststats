Any way, I've been much excited that Panera opened near my new office and school.\n\nI came here to pick up lunch for myself and my co-workers and amazingly the line wasn't long and the wait for food wasn't either. Efficient customer service and good quality of food. The staff here are so nice, friendly, and generous.\n\nI really didn't know which soup to get, the first one that caught my eye was the creamy tomato soup and I did a \"you pick 2\" special. So my sandwich was the Asiago roast beef. The sandwich was small and extremely colorful. I totally forgot to take a picture, will do next time I have their sandwich. I really enjoyed the texture of the roast beef because it was light and soft. \n\nThe staff here are very accommodating because they gave free Italian bread and even small bags of croutons. I must come back here to try more menu items. \n\nThank god for Panera Bread!", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-14", "description": "Sunday afternoon, order of 2 cookies and 2 iced chai drinks require a 20 minute wait?\n\nWhy do we have a staff of 6, with 4 on break including the manager in the seating area.\n\nKhalil is not meant to be a one man show.", "author": "Shayan K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-01", "description": "I'm so glad Panera Bread came to Downtown Brooklyn.

The drinks are refreshing! \n\nThis place is great to have around, especially when they have a good staff and their food is so consistently on point. \n\nThe Mac \u0026 Cheese w.

At least I won't. Come during breakfast or lunchtime; any time, but the hour within closing. I'll probably just head to my previous locations instead though when I have a craving for my Pick Two combos.  Please re-train your Monday night's staff. \n\nI love Panera Bread, for their Pick Two combo meals. I never had an issue with any of my orders, but today was my first negative encounter. I've been an avid customer at this location for the past year since starting school nearby and the customer service has been great, but not today. The visits before this location were always at the Manhattan locations or during the afternoon at this spot. Today, I ordered through my Panera app on my phone once I got out of class around 8:40PM, thinking they close at 9PM so I should hurry in case there is a line before closing. I was unable to create a Dine In order so I ordered a Rapid Pick Up, which would be ready in 10 minutes after my order submission.  I ordered my usual Pick Two combo - the usual BBQ chicken salad and a mac\u0026cheese with the French Baguette on the side. Once submitted, I was already close by, only a few stores down. As I walked in towards the Pick Up counter, the female server asked the area if anyone was waiting for a rapid order, I notified her I did and she saw that my order just came in \"0secs ago\". She commented under her breath, \"I was about to say...\" she didn't seem to happy about it. I wasn't expecting it during that second, no rush. I just walked in, so I could understand if it was not ready yet, but she wanted to notify a previous rapid order customer they ran out of sough dough bread. She then goes on to create my order. The male server working with her said there isn't any more mac\u0026cheese after my order and that he \"didn't want to go upstairs to get it\". \n\nAs I waited, my order was ready at the counter a few minutes after. I went upstairs to eat it before heading home for the night. To my surprise, the mac\u0026cheese was VERY cold. It was ALWAYS hot and ready to eat on my other visits.  This time, the mac\u0026cheese was cold as hell, the cup was warm to the touch but if you dug into the food, it was cold as hell. I knew right then they only \"heated\" it up for only about a minute or maybe 30 seconds from the fridge. Stupid me; I was really hungry after a long 9hr school day, so I didn't want to go back downstairs and create a scene.  Despite the cold mac\u0026cheese, I turned to my salad, thinking that can't go wrong, BUT that didn't taste the same as how it used to be either when I do order from here. There was only a dab or two of BBQ sauce on the lower left side of the salad instead of the few DRIZZLES I used to get on the ENTIRE top of the salad. Is it because it's almost closing time that your work ethics can be so half-assed? Would you guys want your food to be like mine today? Pretty sure no one does. Rude on the \"cooking\"/food preparation aspect. Also, I didn't have the french baguette side bread in my rapid pick up bag. I left about 10 minutes after my meal. It was suppose to be my dinner; overall, what a disappointment. I've came here before after class around the same time on other weekdays, but the service was never like today's.  \n\nSo why only 2 stars if everything was great every other time before this? Minus 1 star for attitude, minus another for food preparation and accuracy. Minus another because like the rating says \"Meh, I've experienced better\" and I have.", "author": "Kaycee C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-01", "description": "This location is sooo sloowww.

What drew me in was the breakfast egg souffl\u00e9 that used to be impeccable. However here are my major gripes:\n\n1. There is always a long wait for them to make a sandwich... Doesn't matter how simple and they don't always have the right bread on hand.\n\n2. The eggs in the sandwich, particularly the 'Mediterranean Egg White' sandwich are consistently rubbery and bland.\n\n3. To my surprise, when I ordered their 4 cheese egg souffl\u00e9 last week, it was STALE. Call me crazy, but I went back that afternoon and got the clam chowder soup... Again, STALE.\n\n4. Ordered a Pumpkin Spice latte, with whipped cream a few days later, only to be told they don't have any whipped cream in the entire store. Really? To top it off, the beverage was VERY sweet...

Sadly yes. The fact is, I love Panera. I've loved it when it was St. Louis Bread Co and only existed in Missouri. I was very excited to hear they were opening locations in NYC. So why 1 star?\n\nThe corporate employee that decided to open locations in NYC clearly didn't do his/her research good enough. The entire concept of a lunch place here is about getting people in and out fast. Fast being the crucial element. \n\nPanera's in the Midwest take their time. Life is slower there. Sadly they have the same mentality here. Meaning you will be waiting a LONG time to order then another a LONG time to get you food. \n\nThey clearly didn't bother to alter their business processes to fit the need of their location. At noon on a Monday lunch, there is only a single checker standing next 5 empty registers. The employees preparing food are lackadaisically assembling sandwiches and salads. Frankly, I were the manager here, I'd be ashamed at my restaurant managing skills. \n\nSo, one star.

I ordered, it said that it went through and my order should be done in 5-10 minutes after the order was placed.

Now there's no more chatter just wide eyes, smirks and snickers. A team member wearing a purple shirt asked me my order while looking at the KDS screen and started to nodding while going over an order on the screen. Now if my order was never made...
