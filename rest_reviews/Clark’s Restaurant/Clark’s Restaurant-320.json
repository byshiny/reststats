I must give credit where its due and they really deserve it for their breakfasts as its awesome. Good coffee, and the service is usually very good.  For the wine drinkers out there, they seem to have a helluva lot of wine on the shelves, at if my memory services correct, it was about 30 bottles of Yellow Tail.  Go figure.\n\nPrices are about average for a typical diner, but if you want the real diner feel, walk two blocks to the Park Plaza Diner.", "author": "Jared B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-19", "description": "While not one for the gourmets - this is one of my favorite Eggs Benedicts in New York, even when delivered the eggs are just perfect.

The place is small, but not too small, well decorated with the classical station playing low for ambiance. The wait staff is friendly and consistent (and while we're not on a first name basis, many of the waiters recognize me when I walk in, which is a nice touch), and the food never takes \"too\" long to come out. \n\nFood wise, I've yet to be \"really\" disappointed with a meal I've had there. I usually stick to breakfast items, specifically the Western with Cheese, wheat toast, banana pancakes, french toast and the like. The lunch and dinner items are not bad either though. My only complaints in that department is a little over pricing. A grilled cheese of any substance (ham, avocado, tomato, etc.) was around $8, and the grilled caesar warp didn't feel like it justified the $7 or $8 price tag. Although, this could be remedied by soup or fried or some such (not free sides mind you). \n\nI have only two real complaints:\n\n1) If you got on weekends, or during lunch rush, there are often many, many, MANY kids in the place, and if your just trying to get a bite before you go off on your day this can be bothersome, as most of the kids are under the age of 7. I think this is because of the many churches and \"learning centers\" nearby. Whatever, not much I can do about it.\n\n2) They're not open long enough! It's a diner, but it's a step above, and isn't open 24 hours. I can't tell you how many times I've wanted a good meal at 3am and had to resort to \"Crappy Days\" or that other place. \n\nIf you're in the heights, GO! There is something for everyone, and despite not being open 24 hrs, you can get breakfast as long as they're open.", "author": "Matthew K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-30", "description": "Mediocre.

A friend and I came here well into the afternoon and ordered some breakfast. We slept in late so we hadn't eaten anything. He got the pancakes, eggs, and bacon. I got French Toast. He's really cheap and didn't want to pay the $3 for real syrup, but I can't stand the fake stuff. So I got the Maple and poured it over my Fruit and Nut French Toast and I must say that my meal was absolutely amazing. I haven't had French Toast in YEARS and now I wish I had it everyday. My friend enjoyed his bacon and eggs but wasn't enjoying the pancakes. When he ran out of syrup he dipped his pancake into some syrup that was pooled on my plate and it blew his mind! It was hilarious! All of a sudden he was obsessed with the pancakes when they had real syrup on them. I always tell him, \"You get what you pay for. Now he wants to plan another trip here. He's a funny guy.

Prices are reasonable (expect to pay $9-15 for a good breakfast) and the portions are good.
