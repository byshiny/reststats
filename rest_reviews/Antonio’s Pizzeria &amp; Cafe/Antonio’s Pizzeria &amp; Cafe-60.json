I find it to be really quick, but I generally only get a slice or two. I would go there much more often bc it is right by my office, but I find some of the people who work there to be annoying/creepy.  Literally every time me or my co-working go in there and ask for a slice to be extra hot, the guys says \"hot like me\" or \"hot like you\". Just warm up my pizza and keep the comments to yourself.", "author": "Debra L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-19", "description": "Perfect place to grab a quick slice at lunch and I would definetly recommend their calzones!", "author": "Thomas P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-03-22", "description": "Not even a close shadow of its former self at Adams Stree extension (Boerum Place).
