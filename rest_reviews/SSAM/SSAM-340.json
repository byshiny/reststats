They serve very authentic food, especially when it comes to the Korean dishes and I have eaten a lot of Korean dishes because of my girlfriend. No only the fact that the food is good, but they also have pretty good service as well. There are some dishes that are priced high, but its priced high for very good reason being that the food is legit. \n\nMy usual order at any restaurant that serves Korean food would be the \"hot stone bibimbop\". When I tried theirs, I was in genuinely surprised on how fresh the food tasted. I also tried a few other dishes, as well as their dumplings(steamed and fried) all in one sitting(yes, including the hot stone bibimbop) and let me tell you, my stomach couldn't thank me enough. Though it was a lot of food, I could still distinguish how well seasoned everything tasted.  \n. \nThe only downside would be the location. Though it is located pretty far in Brooklyn, I feel like this is the type of restaurant that you should visit more once. For this reason, I am giving this restaurant a 5 star rating. I recommend it for the Korean cuisine lovers. Trust me, you'll enjoy it.", "author": "Christian R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-19", "description": "a good add to the burgeoning brooklyn korean food scene. they have the full range of korean food including bibimbap, bbq, etc. the food is good if not particularly unique or creative. the space is large and comfortable and the staff are friendly.", "author": "Wesley H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-25", "description": "Don't do take out for the wings!

The seafood was clearly straight from a frozen bag. The squid pieces were hard, not just rubbery but hard. They had the consistency, size and shape of rubber bullets. It would surprise you that they would serve this at a restaurant. \nWeird- For the entire time I was there-like 40 mins-they played one obscure and obnoxious rap song over and over again. The same song. For 40 minutes. \nFrozen seafood and \"chinese water torture\" styled ambience-Nice!", "author": "Pete C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "After making many treks to 32nd St for our Korean food fix, we finally tried Ssam after purchasing a Groupon (more on that later).  We were pleasantly surprised by this local Korean eatery. Had the chicken drumsticks which were plump and crisp. Forgot the name of it but it was not the soy garlic or spicy style. These had a sweet glaze and were great with our Hite beer. Also had the soon tofu stew which was pretty good. Not on par with BCD but still tasty. I noticed they don't ask how spicy you want it but I think they cater to the neighborhood and make it just mildly spicy. The japchae was OK but maybe a tad greasy. Probably from the beef. The banchan (sp?) was great. So, they canceled the Groupon deal before it was pulled off Groupons site so we were bummed. The manager was cool about it and took care of us which was nice and the right thing to do. We will make this a regular spot and will no longer trek into Manhattan when having Korean cravings.", "author": "Rick S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-12", "description": "Had dinner there with a friend last Thursday evening. The food was outstanding and the service and ambiance super great. I had Dumplings as an Appetizer and Bibambap as my Entree.  My friend had some type of Hot Plate Chicken which was served on a sizzling plate.  He really enjoyed his meal as I did mine. We both agreed that we will venture out to Brooklyn again from Manhattan in the very near future to revisit SSAM and get to try some of the other items on the menu that look so inviting. Another plus is the cost. The prices are good especially for the excellent quality of the food and service.", "author": "Richard M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-31", "description": "We had a wonderful meal of bibimbap and the jjige pork stew.

Authentic Korean food I would know I visited south Korea before. First the kimichi was really good and it did not have the stinky smell, the miso soup excellent, the pork dumplings with there special sauce was good. The beef bugoli and the friend chicken cutlets was like a party in your mouth. Definitely will visit again when my taste bud desire delicious Korean dishes.", "author": "Deneisha D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-06", "description": "Authentic Korean food in Cobble Hill! I tried out Ssam on a cold, snowy day in January out of curiosity. Ordered haemul soondubu (soft tofu soup with seafood) - probable fare if you were in Seoul on a similar evening. I have to say I was pretty impressed. Many Korean restaurants on this side of the Pacific overly sweeten their food, or compensate with too much soy sauce. I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic flavor of the broth - especially the spiciness - which hit all the right notes. There was plenty of tofu and seafood, so I left plenty full and half expecting to step out into the bustle of Jongno or Gwanghwamun. Alas, still in Brooklyn. Definitely recommended and will be back.", "author": "Mike M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-09", "description": "Great addition to the neighborhood.

Their small dishes are so athentic and tastes good. Servers are kind and professional enough. They dont mind refill our small dishes. And their Kimchi Jjigae is really good! For sure better than Ktown with packed and noisy restaurants.

And it's actually good! I had the Dol Sot Bibimbap (stone bowl) and it was great.  It came out super hot so as to cook the beef and egg in the dish during the mixing, and the rice was perfectly crunchy on the bottom. This was dol sot bibimbap as it should be.  This restaurant is as good as the ones you can find in Manhattan k-town (nothing beats the restaurants in Queens). I can't wait to try the fried chicken next time!  So very happy to find a genuine Korean joint in the Cobble Hill hood. Also this place was very child friendly. If you're reading this and not sure about this place, at least just check it out once (instead of relying on reviews...) since food can be so subjective.  But I'm very happy about having Korean food near me that I had to write a review to hopefully encourage others to try it and keep this place in business.  I guess the only negative thing about this place is that the banchan was a little skimpy, but not a big deal since it is the ONLY Korean restaurant in...

I started with the wings and they did not disappoint. Crispy and well cooked. I also had the kimchi jigae which satisfied my craving. It was good, but not excellent. The wait staff was very nice, but service seemed slightly disorganized, probably due to the fact they've only been open a few days. Unfortunately they don't have their liquor license yet, but they do plan on having it in the next few weeks. I definitely plan on going back to try some of the other food. I love that I have somewhere to get Korean good in the neighborhood! Hope this place does well. Please go try it!

The place is odd. It used to be a Japanese restaurant, Aji 53, and the interior hasn't changed much. But while Aji 53 served decent food and seemed to draw a sizable crowd, this new place was practically empty. Well, it was some of the worst bibimbap I've ever had, unfortunately, and rather overpriced at that. Way too greasy and tasteless. I don't particular like hot sauce and when I get bibimbap in Koreatown I add very little, but there the dishes are full of flavor. At Ssam I added a lot of hot sauce but still the bibimbap did not taste right...\nThe dish was supposed to come with three side dishes. We got three for two people (having ordered two bibimbaps). True, after we ate them, the waitress came to ask if we wanted more, which was nice, but I think she could have just brought them out, since they were supposed to come with the dishes we had ordered. I was also a little surprised when the couple sitting next to us got more and a wider variety of banchan. All in all, this was a forgettable experience and we won't go back. I wish Aji 53 hadn't closed down.", "author": "Branfa B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-02", "description": "Worst excuse for Korean food I have ever seen.
