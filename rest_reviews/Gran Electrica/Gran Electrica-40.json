Great drinks and good music. They had some really interesting tequilas. My favorite was the Tequila Ocho. They can serve it anyway you want it. The bartenders are quite skilled in their craft.

We are local Dumbo residents and come here often, but realize that this establishment does not prioritize the customer experience and overcharges for just about everything. They charge $7 for chips and salsa (!), and while the salsa is good, the chips are not and taste like they're over fried. When we ran out of salsa we asked for more so we can finish our chips, they wanted to charge us for another salsa!! Are you kidding me?! Most restaurants provide this for free, but when we place an order of $7 chips and salsa, we should receive a replenishment of salsa if we still have chips to finish at the very least! And the serving of salsa is so tiny to begin with! The bartender refused and when I pushed back, she asked the manager and the answer was still no. Unreal. Come here for an overpriced experience with blah customer service.", "author": "Kimberly M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-14", "description": "Made a res at Gran Electrica to celebrate my bday with a group of friends. Without getting into the messy details, let's just say there was a pretty big miscommunication on my end. The staff at Gran Electrica had every right to hold us to our mistake, but instead they were INCREDIBLY kind and accommodating. We ended up having an excellent time, food/drinks were great (we had mostly tacos and margs), and we were never rushed. A++ Special shoutout to GM Andrew and our wonderful server!

We basically waited for about 10-15 minites without a reservation which wasnt too bad.\n\nThe menu is basically cheese, cheese, and more cheese. I got a pot of cheese with chips which was delicious. \n\nThey have an outdoor area that is beautiful and I love that our group was not rushed despite their popularity.\n\nIt's a great date spot or place to hang out with a small group of friends.", "author": "Camille H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-08", "description": "This place is so cute! What a great outdoor area, definitely recommend everyone check this out in the summer!\n\nI got a margarita and it was delicious! We also ordered the chips, guacamole and salsa which was good. We also got the ceviche which was very refreshing, and also ordered the chorizo quesadilla.

I love the Brooklyn Bridge Park Area close to Dumbo so I was hyped to finally eat at Gran but- it was absolutely DISAPPOINTING.\n\nI've ate at Gramdalis and Pedro's around the area both are pretty okay but Gran Electrica stands out so beautifully you would think it's four-five star dining but it's truly not.\n\nI went with my best friend and as soon as we sat down our waitress greeted us and gave us a menu. Long story short- the LADY WAS RUDE. Just out right miserable. She forgot my friends drink. Looked annoyed when we asked her what she would recommend, not attentive at all to us really. Which idk maybe they need more waiters \u0026 waitresses? Anywhom.\n\nFood was ok. Just ok. Pretty pricey for Ok. \nDon't like their salsa. Tacos pastor was just pernil on a soft taco shell. Salsa tasted like marinara sauce. Chips were salty.\n\nMargarita was way too strong (I know what you're thinking how is that a bad thing) but the mix they put in was very sour didn't help out the tequila. Not a good balance. Just didn't like it. Oh and when I asked for a straw for my drink they didn't have straws.............. hmmm okay? \n\nI think my rent here is done.

The sun was out and the heat was up and there's only one way out of that situation: HYDRATE.\n\nWe were in the mood for a cocktail, so the Yelp app led us here to this gem. I was immediately charmed by the exterior of the venue as it was clearly in an older building that had likely been there for well over 100 years. Walking in, the space was dark except for dim lighting and natural sunlight. People and one family with their little baby were leaning over the bar awaiting their drinks while others took up some of the smaller tables. I was hoping the space would be bigger since it's hot and no one wants to be immersed in body heat. Despite the little crowd, we were offered a table for two either outside or in. Wanting to be outside again - it might've been hot but it was just gorgeous out - we ultimately made a great decision. Walking towards the back gave us a tour of the venue essentially. Before stepping out onto the patio, there's a larger space for people to sit by the window to enjoy the light but stay perfectly cool. Walking out, we looked down to see a lush, green space with flowers, umbrellas and a small outdoor bar. Going down the stairs it felt as though we were walking into someone elses yard - a yard filled with tables to accommodate several friends who would at any moment drop by to have a meal or drink.\n\nSitting down, we were facing the back of the building and other tables that were quickly filling up with other thirsty patrons. All the servers wore immaculate black and white uniforms but had very cool attitudes. Our server was particularly fun, offering us their special which was a discounted frozen drink in either a small or large size that could be shared with 2 or more people (or just 1 with no judgments). While we waited, it would seem a reservation would absolutely be necessary so we counted ourselves lucky! Not feeling paricularly peckish, we decided to have snacks. I had two tiny Tinga de Pollo tacos (roasted tomato-chipotle braised goffle road amish chicken, queso fresco, crema, cilantro) and B had two tiny Carnita tacos (heritage berkshire pork, onion, cilantro, lime, salsa verde). None were spicy or terribly mind blowing but they were packed with flavor and truly hit the spot. To be honest, our drink was the star and I would say come here for the drinks and nothing but the drinks - unless your blood sugar plummets then that's when the tacos will come to save the day. And don't hate me, but I don't remember the name of the frozen drink but it comes in a trademark, chic copper pineapple shaped cup. It was the perfect size (small) to share between two people and it was utterly delicious - like having coladas on the beach and leaving your OOO notification to answer your e-mails for you. \n\nFour solid stars for the location, ambience, service and drinks! I can't wait to come back when I make the journey to Brooklyn again!", "author": "Anna F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-10", "description": "A group of my friends and I went to Gran El\u00e9ctrica for dinner and drinks yesterday evening and had an amazing time! Although there was an initial hiccup with finding our reservation, the staff was quick, friendly, and accommodating. \n\nOnce we were seated, a server came and checked in with us to make sure that we were comfortable. After quickly perusing the menu, we settled on a mix of margaritas and sangria (our group highly recommends the Margarita de Toronja Picante and Ay Mami!). \n\nEach of us tried a different plate of tacos, had rice, beans, and plantains (which were a real hit!). All the food was wonderful, fresh, and flavorful. Everyone loved what they ate (especially dessert - the p\u00fadin de chocolate was delicious)\n\nThe service was outstanding, and the whole mood and ambiance of the restaurant was fun and welcoming. \n\nI've been here many times before, but this visit was one of the best.

I loved everything about this place: the food, service, decor, lighting, music, and over all vibe. It's hip without being douchey, and high quality without being pretentious.\n\nMy friends and I stumbled in on a busy Saturday night. The host/manager was super kind and helpful in getting us set up at the bar and said he'd have a table for us in 30 minutes... we were at our table in less than 20. \n\nOur margaritas were perfect. (I had the Pepino, a margarita with cucumber and cilantro in it.) We shared the queso fundido with chorizo to start, and that was really tasty. I'm glad we were sharing it, or I'd have eaten that whole bowl of melted cheese and chorizo. I really wanted the guac, but my friend hates avocado. (Who the hell hates avocado???) I ordered the fish tacos, which were delicious. Good fish tacos always remind me of being on vacation in Mexico. My friends and I shared the plantains and black beans, both were well-prepared and really satisfying. \n\nOur waiters were attentive and sweet, which can be rare toward the end of a shift, and even though our food came out fast, they didn't rush us out. \n\nSo that was our late-night snack.

The food was disgusting, the drinks was discusting. That was not Mexican food. I will never come back. The nerve of charging $16 beyond small guacamole butter dish. Highway robbery.  I wont recommend this place to anyone. Tasteless. We put salt on everything. I have to brush my teeth to get the taste out of my mouth. And rinse with mouth wash.

Expensive for no reason! First, they wait until I ask for not one but two items from the menu, the Al Pastor and a drink that has passion fruit, guava, etc and they respond they were out. Why not state that in the beginning before orders are placed. When our food comes out the portion especially the rice is served on a dish small like the ones used for small sauces.

Especially on weekends when dumbo is insane. \n\nThe margaritas are spot on excellent. Could have sat there all day just drinking them. \n\nThe food was good but not absolutely brilliant hence the 4 not 5 stars. My kids both had the quesadilla. It came out with no side of guacamole. Not a huge issue but it was tiny. About half the size of any other quesadilla I have ever ordered. An odd choice\n\nI had a brunch item which was tortilla chips soaked in green salsa and then fried eggs on top. It was good but had too many tortilla chips wadged together to make the bowl look fuller. I would have preferred less, to have had it served on a plate and then to have some salad or\nSliced avocado on the side. Just a thought. I really liked the first few mouthfuls but stopped half way through as it was just too much. \n\nThe garden opens end of April and I think spending a long afternoon sitting in it and drinking margaritas could be a perfect way to spend a weekend day.
