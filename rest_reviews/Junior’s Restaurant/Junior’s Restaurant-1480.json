The coffee is EXCELLENT!  The cake is mediocre.  I've had the red velvet, german chocolate, carrot cake and chocolate layer and they were DRY.  The cheesecake was good, but I don't get what the hype is about.

They have such large portions I've not once had the space to have some of their famous pie.  Avoid going Sunday mornings because it's ridiculously crowded, although the space is quite expansive.  It's a great place to go after a long day at the beach.

I came in for breakfast, so I can't comment on the cheesecake.  Am I still allowed to keep typing?  I mean, cheesecake is what makes this place famous.  Still, the standard breakfast items are good.  Pancakes are thick and fluffy.  Blintzes would have been better if they had not been deep-fried.  I ordered mine with cherries, but got strawberries.  Our server's mind just didn't seem to be on his work.  In fact, we barely saw him and the place was not busy at all.  I really loved the decor at Junior's -- it's kind of a 1950s circus theme.  In other words, it's ugly, but you wouldn't want them to change a thing!", "author": "Raina S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-01-29", "description": "overrated, slow help, foods sucks, and is way OVERPRICED.

They followed the tradition once I was born and I still eat there to this day. I've been there for a quick bite, a good sit down lunch/dinner with friends and family, breakfast at the counter. And a bunch of times to get a cheesecake, strawberry of course. I can sit here and describe the decor, service, food, prices etc... but even if I was the best writer that ever existed... words cannot substitute actually enjoying a meal at this establishment. Go..

This franchise consists of all the Americana hearty dishes and then some.  Big dishes, big portions, big price.  What may throw you off a bit are the immigrant waiters that are taking your orders.  Yes, I said waiterS taking your orders.  They speak english and expel hospitality their own way.

So many people have raved about it. I went there twice. (I'm all about second chances.) The first time I went, I wasn't too impressed, but I was thinking maybe it just wasn'ta good day for the restaurant. But the second time I went, confirmed why I won't ever be coming back. The place is crappy, the cheesecake (and food) is nasty, and the service isn't the best. I mean, you would think they would at least update the place. But no, it's still crappy looking Junior's.
