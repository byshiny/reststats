As a native New Yorker, it is somewhat of a ritual to have a bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll or bagel on a Saturday morning. Cranberry's is one of the few places that can deliver on this in an affordable and consistent way. They have a really nice team and the store owners are often there to make you feel comfortable and at home.

The neighborhood is also really cool. I've never had any food so I won't comment on anything they cook. However my only problem with this spot is the only thing I've come there for: coffee. \n\nEvery time I get their hot coffee, it seriously tastes like toilet water. It just isn't any good. Maybe they don't clean their pot often? Maybe they use really lousy beans? Regardless, I never found the coffee to be pleasant. There's plenty of other spots for coffee in the area, so I'm not sure why I stuck with Cranberry's despite all of the other local options. In any case, don't waste your money on their coffee, you'll regret it.", "author": "Josiah B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-20", "description": "So it's right off the train and I really wanted a breakfast sand which .... I'll just say I am Still eating while I write this but am disappointed... my bacon egg and cheese has legit one piece of bacon in it ... the croissant is good and so is the egg.... but it's completely miss the bacon for $6.50 I don't feel I received my money's worth. 3 stars bc the service was fast and the sandwich would be great jf it actually had the bacon I paid for in it...", "author": "Victoria M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-11", "description": "After trying to figure out NYC's subway system and getting lost a few times trying to get to the Brooklyn Bridge, we became hangry and decided to grab a small snack to help us continue our journey. Cranberry's was nearby.\n\nThe place is small and is pretty compacted inside. They had a variety of pastries to choose from as well as a menu where you can order sandwiches, salads and other things. The customer service was okay. It wasn't superb, but it's a buy your food and dip type of thing.\n\nWe got the danish bread and it was great. It had a nice sweet touch to it and was cooked well. Definitely helped us with the rest of our journey to the bridge that's for sure.", "author": "Marc C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-26", "description": "I really like their homemade scones. Not always the same amount of butter to salt nor maybe even degree of freshness but the scones are so simple and wonderful that way. More of a giant biscuit than most scones you'd likely find really. And if you come on a weekday morning you will see how crazy it gets in the teeny shop.

It seems like a go to spot for the locals. \n\nTons of pastries, sandwich and bagel options, as well as cold sides to choose from. \n\n\nLox bagel - good. Lox was fresh. Bagel was soft and fluffy. The bagel was large and half got me full. \n\nSpinach and cheese croissant - good.

This is a quaint shop near the subway station in an up and coming neighborhood.  \n\nThis isn't a place to sit and eat your delectables, but rather take them to go.

Coffee (especially the latte) is terrific, too, and so is their loyalty card that they stamp, earning you a free coffee after buying 10. There is usually a line in the small store but the employees are friendly and move efficiently, especially during \"rush\" hour in the morning. I hardly ever see scones anymore, and when I do, they are coated in sugar - so it's nice to taste a traditional, freshly-made scone from Cranberry's (I either get the cranberry or blueberry).", "author": "Jen O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-20", "description": "One of the more reasonably priced cafe/deli spots in this area. The have both baked goods and sandwiches. Employees are usually very nice and they have a lot of regular morning coffee customers that go there. Not a lot of room to sit but you are close to Cadman Plaza if you want to grab some snacks and go sit on those benches.
