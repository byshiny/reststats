Now this is a name change, but I have been coming here so long I forgot the original name.  The service is quick, the food is good and fresh. I must admit from time.to time a few unsavory character's come through,  but......\nYou can get practically anything you want here, now keep in mind this is a Chinese food restaurant.  You can get pork chops, oxtail, rice and beans and fried plantains. The combos are endless, and great deals. You can also get traditional dishes as well.  Quick, cheap, good and hot. Not to mention, yeah it's a hole in the wall. But a good one.lol.\nI was going to take a picture,  but someone ran in to keep from getting beat up, so it disturbed my groove.

Who doesn't  love some chicken and broccoli with pork fried rice?\nI regret stepping foot in this place. The chicken had no taste, the little sauce they did give me was salty and the pork fried rice was very unpleasing to the eyes. This is by far THE WORST Chinese food I ever ate.

Don't understand the negative reviews since everything I had surpassed my expectations. I usually order the roasted duck or roasted pork over rice.

I've only ever ordered food to take back to the office, but the tables and booths seem to always be full during lunchtime, which is always a good sign. The food is on par with similar establishments that everyone has undoubtedly gone to over the years, which isn't a bad thing at all.\n\nIt isn't the cleanest or most grand restaurant in the area, but the staff is super friendly, the prices are standard and the food gives you that proper dose of \"oh man why did I do this for lunch, now I have a food coma, I regret this decision, but so delicious.\"\n\nSince it's a couple of blocks away from the office, and since the staff is so friendly, I'll continue to be a patron.", "author": "Hooney H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-16", "description": "Lapin and I was in the area and I decided to order some take out. There wasn't much patron in the store other than 2 or 3 people. I ordered chicken and broccoli with a quart of chicken fried rice and an egg roll. The egg roll was greasy and tasted bland.

Even if it was not perfect, for such prices, I would give 5 stars.

The bbq rib tips tasted alright, but were kinda hard and they tore up the inside of my mouth, much much worse than hot pizza!

I no longer feel this way. Today, my ribs with pork fried rice and egg roll combo was so terrible that I felt like I was being \"punk'd.\"  Fried rice was cold and mushy and my rib sections were each at least 95% fat with a streak of tough, underdone meat hiding beneath all the goo. When I bit into my egg roll I thought to myself,\n\n\"Dang...this thing's dripping with juice!\"\n\nThen I remembered that egg rolls aren't supposed to be juicy. It was GREASE, loose and splashing from my egg roll (groan.) Lee's Villa is a really drab and sad looking place as well and the bathrooms look like the type you'd find in the visiting area of a lockup.

Don't eat here. \n\nI've ordered Sesame Chicken, BBQ Spare Ribs, and Beef and Broccoli lunch specials from this place when I've gone there over the past few years. I've worked in the area and there are no good Chinese food places around, so I give this place another shot every year or so. Well, I'm done. Overpriced and either bland or bad food every time. \n\nFried rice that comes with the specials is some of the worst I've ever had. Entrees just taste bad, are all fatty cuts of meat, are way overcooked or all of the above. Egg rolls come out with grease dripping out of them. I've never been able to finish a meal here and I'm never trying again. \n\n2 stars only because the staff is nice enough. The only nice thing I can say about the food is that is isn't quite inedible, but its close.
