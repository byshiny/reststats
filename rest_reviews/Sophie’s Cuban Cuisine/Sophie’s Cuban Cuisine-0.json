Their empanadas are always bomb af! My favorite is the chicken because I don't eat red meat, but all of them are GOOD! Also -- definitely try it with their hot sauce (I always get the green one) but try them all.\n\nI also had the yellow rice, black beans, and chicken. It was good but the chicken could've been seasoned more  My food HAS TO have flavor or I don't want it! Lol for this plate \u0026 2 empanadas I paid $17 \u200d a little pricey but what are you going to do?

I ordered a beef empanada which was amazing but the customer service was eh. They were not pleasant and friendly! My coworker asked what the prices were and instead of informing her she told her to look at the menu. If you ask me, it's a little unprofessional.

The staff are completely careless. This is my neighborhood go-to spot and because I do love the food, I am always going to be completely honest. Monday through Friday the staff are excellent. The guy who mans the cash register in the evenings is AWESOME. Please hire more people like him. But on Sundays for some reason the service deteriorates substantially. Today in particular the girl left my tiny container of rice and beans half empty and then carelessly threw my container of garlic shrimp upside down in the bag causing it to spill everywhere. So disappointing. For $15 all I expect is a full container of rice \u0026 beans and for the  cashier to be even a tiny bit careful in packing my food to go. On Sundays? Don't expect any of that. :(", "author": "Kathryn S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-12", "description": "Good place, good choices.

Great options. I tried their chicken sandwich which was pressed I believe.

Sandwich was ok, but the Chicken soup they gave me was really really bad. It was literally chicken skin and oil. After spending 10 minutes of trying to spoon all the oil out, I just gave up and threw it out. \n\nBeen back since last review and I ordered the same Lunch special and the sandwich was good as usual and the soup was way better.

ANGRY GREMLINS WORK HERE. I LOVE Sophie's Cuban and it's a treat every time I stop by one so I was thrilled when this place opened nearby! And although the food was great, the service was HORRIBLE. I guess they thought my tan boyfriend wouldn't understand their Spanish but he did. And he understood what they were saying about him and many of the other patrons waiting to order. Rude as hell.\n\nMy boyfriend and two other customers were standing out of the line to look at the menu and get their orders together. Once the people in line were done ordering, the emplie kept saying \"Next, Next\" but no on was ready to order yet nor was anyone standing on the line. The employees barked at us to hurry up because they have phone orders and once my boyfriend was ready to order they literally looked past him! Ignored him! Asked someone behind him for their order and the guy pointed to my boyfriend and said \"He's next. He's trying to order.\" The lady gave an attitude and we had to explain to her that when people walk into a restaurant, they need a second to look at the menu. Just because you're busy at work doesn't mean your work stress should be rushing and stressing others. They apologized at the register for the attitude but that's not enough once you've already had a temper tantrum towards customers from behind the counter.

Portion sizes here are definitely generous.. food for days. Lunch specials comes with an entree and your choice of 3 sides. My go-to sides are usually the sweet plantains, which are absolutely delicious as always, black beans, and yellow rice. I tried the white beans with avocado once, I didn't really like it. The rice is a hit or miss. Sometimes it's very soggy, other times it's good. I also tried a few of the entrees, the only one I liked is prob the baked chicken. The baked chicken was juicy and flavorful.

I figured four stars on Yelp and it's a sandwich, so should be pretty easy and good. I wasn't wrong entirely, but I was most certainly disappointed. \n\nThe line was long on a weekday afternoon, but it moved quickly. Most people seemed to be ordering from the buffet style already, but a few people got sandwiches as well. \n\nThe bread was good. The condiments were fine. But the pork, the pork was unnecessarily dry and that is unforgivable, especially since the sandwich alone plus tax cost ten dollars and change. I was not pleased. Thank goodness for the green sauce. That sauce was absolutely amazing! \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning here again. If the prices were better, I'd come back to try something else on the menu, slathered in green sauce of course.
