I was hungry \u0026 broke, and craving an eggroll. \n\n1 General Tso's Combination Platter, STAT. \n\nThis shit lasted me 3 days. 3 DAYS!!!!! SO. MUCH. FOOD. It cost me 2.16666666....cents per day! And it's infinitely better than Kum Kau or Park Avenue! Granted, I felt absolutely disgusting after eating this, but how else are you supposed to feel after eating this \"chinese\" grub? \n\nIf you are looking for cheap eats in the area, this is definitely one of the better spots...if you don't feel like Park Avenue Luncheonette.", "author": "Briana M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-26", "description": "Not the best, but not the worst.
