But I am outraged at their dishonest pricing policy. They add a 20% gratuity to the bill without telling you this is their policy, then list recommended tips based on the total, including the already charged gratuity.

The waiters were attentive and charming as usual.  The eggplant rigatoni that I had and the spinach and ricotto gnocchi that my boyfriend had were both delicious.  Coming from an Italian family where every Sunday night meant delicious homemade pasta, I have some pretty high standards when it comes to Italian and this place always delivers.  My pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was so good that I sopped it all up with the amazing focaccia bread. \n\nI managed to save some room for dessert last night and while the chocolate souffle was not quite as amazing as their pasta dishes, it was still very good.  And the complimentary moscata that our waiter brought over was a very nice touch that made us feel special.  This place is officially my favorite restaurant in Fort Greene.  I don't know why it rarely is that crowded (I guess because it's a hidden gem farther down Dekalb that people overlook?), but I'm happy that I can always get a table and enjoy the intimate vibe in this place.    \n\nAND I'm very happy with the generous portions, because it means that I have more delicious pasta to enjoy for lunch today!", "author": "Stephanie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-30", "description": "Delicious brunch here.

I've had the Papardelle twice. \nThe cheese cake is different. Perhaps made from Ricotta? It's mushier and it has an eggy crust. Not bad but I won't order it again.", "author": "Terry T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-14", "description": "I was looking for a restaurant for brunch on Mother's Day and found this on Open Table.  I checked out the menu and the price (16.99 brunch special) and found it to my liking.  \n\nCons:  Upon my arrival I learned that the \"brunch special\" was now $24.99.  We ordered mimosas and got Prosecco without the slightest hint of orange juice.  Instead of olive oil, the focaccia was served with little tubs of butter (the kind you get in a diner) that hadn't even been warmed and were therefore unspreadable.  \n\nPros: We ordered the Eggs Benedict over prosciutto and steak and eggs.  Both dishes were delicious. The service was very good.\n\nThis wasn't a true Italian restaurant in my consideration. This was the American version of an Italian restaurant. Even the music was more kitschy than real Italian.\n\nAlthough the food was good, the price switch and little things left a  bad taste in my mouth.  I probably won't be going back.  However, if you go in there knowing what to expect, you won't be disappointed and will enjoy the tasty dishes.", "author": "Rachel W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-14", "description": "Really great little find!

No matter how good brunch sounded, Caffe e Vino's selection of homemade pastas could not be resisted.  Despite the lack of a bustling crowd at prime time brunch, don't let looks deceive you.  \n\nI had the rigatoni with italian sausage.  Those homemade rigatoni's were absolutely delicious.

It's a little pricey (a salad appetizer/pasta dish will run you just under $30), but unless your primary meals out are from fast food joints or bodegas, it's no more expensive than anywhere else you would go out for a GREAT meal. Their rigatoni/calamari special is what has me hooked and prompted me to write this review. It's not always on their menu, but whenever it is, that's my go-to order. \n\nI have yet to dine in the restaurant, but in addition to the great food, the restaurant has a very authentic Italian feel to it and a very friendly staff to boot. So, I'm sure it will be an excellent experience when I eventually decide to enjoy a meal there. \n\nA definite MUST if you live in the area or are just passing through for a meal.", "author": "Michael G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-12", "description": "Fantastic very friendly happy service.

We were on our way to the Irondale Theater for a show and just happened upon Caffe e Vino.  When we walked in at 5:30, the staff asked us if we had reservations.  We told them we did not and we were quickly shown to a table.  Luckily, at that hour, there were only a few diners in the place and we were able to get a table.  Shortly after we received our meals, the place began filling up with diners who had made reservations.  We obviously got there just in time;  don't press your luck.  This place is worth making the reservations for.\n\nThe menu, both in aesthetic style and in content, was rustic and wholesome while the service was quick and attentive.  The dishes ordered were beautifully prepared and perfectly appropriate for a rainy night.  The veal meatballs were tender and juicy and arrived with a beautifully arranged fan of fresh, bright vegetables.  We were all amazed by the tomato flan that comes with the bread...a burst of flavor and a unique texture that prepares the diner for a well cooked meal about to arrive.\n\nTotal satisfaction and completely pleased with the experience!", "author": "BRENT M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-26", "description": "The place has a very wooden theme.

Despite all the new restaurants opening in the area, we still probably go about twice every 3 weeks.  The service is fantastic - everyone who works there is incredibly nice and welcoming.\n\nMy favorite dishes are the polenta appetizer (when they have it, it's a special about half time time), the pappardelle (the mushroom sauce is SOOOO good), the chicken scallopini, and the ricotta cheesecake.  The bread they bring is really good but try not to fill up on it.", "author": "Brad K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-04", "description": "My favorite place in Brooklyn.

I'm going to be one of \"those\" reviewers that go against majority and say this place was...bad. Perhaps an off night because I'm a push over but their service was on point.\n\nWe were greeted with cheek kisses(+) as soon as we walked into the restaurant. It felt like home...without the smell of warm apple pie baking in the oven. The dimly lit ambiance set the mood for a chill, low key dinner. There were a lot of couples sitting around our table and I swear I recognized someone from an MTV show -- which has nothing to do with my review.\n\nWe received complimentary bread with tomato flan rather than butter, and to my surprise it was quite tasty. The flavor of the flan was well balanced, not too tangy or salty.\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Calamari which was lightly breaded and cooked just enough so the squid was slightly resilient when chewing.\n\nHere's where the shit hit the fan...\n\nI ordered the Linguini with Shrimp tossed in Garlic and Olive Oil. The pasta was cooked al dente, maybe a bit harder than I would've liked (which is rare for me to say, if you know what I mean...JK!). The shrimp was overcooked and almost felt like I was chewing on flavorless rubber. I felt like the dish was missing something maybe more flavor, but overall it was okay.\n\nMy friends ordered the Ravioli Special and Chicken Scaloppini stuffed with Spinach and Mozzarella. The Ravioli stuffing tasted really good however the wrapper took up 65% of the dish and inadvertently killed the experience. One minute you would be enjoying the stuffing and the next you would be chewing on the pasta wrapper for a hot minute.\n\nAfter my friend took her first bite of the Chicken Scaloppini, she had a sour look on her face. Mind you she had been driving all day from Yonkers to Long Island to Brooklyn without really eating a substantial meal. At this point she was cranky, hungry and ready to slap a bitch just because. The chicken didn't help the situation. It was too salty for someone who likes to add fish sauce to any and every meal possible. Fail.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't think my friends will be anxious to hit up another Italian restaurant anytime soon. :(\n\n(+)  An exaggeration of course, it was more of a French.", "author": "Jen R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-30", "description": "My sister and I were looking for a nice place to have dinner before our first visit to BAM for the John Gabriel Borkman production (Alan Rickman!). Seeing as I have absolutely zero knowledge of quality Brooklyn eateries, I decided to check out the options on Yelp (of course). We made early bird reservations (dinner at 5:30pm??), since we didn't want to chance anything right before the show, especially on a Saturday night.\n\nOf course we were running a bit late, thanks to ridiculous weekend subway issues. But when we walked into Caffe e Vino, we were immediately seated. It's a good thing that we weren't too late because the restaurant quickly filled up at 6pm. Our waiter was very friendly and charming. Since the restaurant is cozy (read: small-ish), he gave us the option of \"checking\" or hanging up our coats in the back. I must say that the menus were quite unique in that they seemed to be glued onto a wooden board of some sort. I'm easily impressed by little things like that. The decor was also nice in a rustic way, what with the brick walls and open-ish kitchen area. \n\nWe skipped appetizers because we wanted to save room for dessert. As a side note, I hate it when I'm too full for sweets. The complimentary bread basket came with this nice tomato flan instead of the usual butter/olive oil/vinegar combo. I hate butter, so this was perfect. In fact, I had to stop myself from picking up another piece of bread because the flan was so perfectly balanced in flavors (at least for me). \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the pappardelle with wild mushrooms, which was rich but not too overwhelming in terms of the sauce. My sister went with the linguini and shrimp/zucchini dish. We both thought that our dishes were nicely cooked, and not too chewy or inedible. I'm not ashamed to say that I cleaned up my plate. It was that good for me.\n\nThe dessert menu was a little much for me (I'm not a very good decision-maker), but I went with the panna cotta. Our waiter convinced my sister to get the lemon-flavored cake special. Both were to die for. \n\nAs far as the temperature of the restaurant goes, it was a bit chilly at times because folks coming in and out did not know how to properly close the door. Plus, it was snowing for the millionth time. Luckily, the waiters were adept at troubleshooting and accommodating slightly miffed diners. The manager/owner (?) was particularly nice in that he held the door as we exited the restaurant. Kudos to him for that personal touch.\n\nFor a local, friendly Italian restaurant, I think Caffe e Vino is definitely worth visiting multiple times. It's probably a good pre-BAM or post-BAM eatery. If I lived in the neighborhood, I would try to become a semi-regular customer. But alas, I live in Queens and this is a bit out of my way if I'm not already in Manhattan.
