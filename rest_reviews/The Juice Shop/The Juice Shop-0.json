This morning went there for a breakfast protein bowl. The register wasn't working for credit cards, so the employees had to take cash only. They were very apologetic and patient, while this situation was occurring and managed the situation at a high level.  Those of us who had cash paid for it, and those with credit cards were taken care of when I was leaving as the register was back up.\n\nThey kept saying that \"it shouldn't have happened.\" I had to remind them that technology sometimes doesn't cooperate and they handled this situation as efficiently as possible.\n\nI know YELP is often used to complain, but just wanted to show some love on a random Wednesday!", "author": "Jay R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-08", "description": "I wish I lived near this place. I'd be in here all the time. \n\nI just wandered in here while waiting for someone at the courthouse nearby. Smelled sooo good. The staff always incredibly friendly. The playlist over the speakers was hitting all the right spots. \n\nI ordered the First Date Oat bowl and a cashew milk and cold brew mix. Both were SUPER good. I also get well fed when I left...like full of energy. \n\nGreat place.

They are a small little shop with a lot to offer. There are fridges to the left with tons of fresh juice options and shots. At the counter is a create a bowl section. Although, it looked delicious I only got a juice to go.

This place. I've only had the smoothies and they are quite good and healthy but the prices. Geezus. They are so expensive. Almost $9 for a smoothie is pretty crazy even though it is delicious. This is definitely a once in a while splurge. We've also had the cold-pressed juice, which is in a bottle but costs $8. I think that's a bit much for a bottled juice. $4-5 feels more reasonable and that's still too much. I know healthy food isn't cheap but it shouldn't be so outrageous. In terms of service,  I've ordered in person and through Yelp and both times have been fine. The service was fine, a bit slower through the online ordering.  Overall it's a splurge that I'll make once in a while.", "author": "Suriyati B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-19", "description": "Newly discovered this holy grail!

I came cross The Juice Shop on Yelp. I hesitated because they only had 3 stars. I ordered the PB \u0026 CJ smoothie. Oddly, none of the staff knew what the \"CJ\" stood for - but they were friendly and professional. I'm still curious so if anyone knows, please message me! It's a bit pricey but I took advantage of the 10% off Yelp check-in which definitely helped.

My nutritionist at Physiologic (practically next door) recommended this place as a healthy lunch spot. Tried the Poke bowl and loved it. It's pricey because of the fish. Then tried the green curry over kale and vegetables because it was almost half the price. Now I'm obsessed. It's so flavorful, full of vegetables and brown rice. I had chicken and it's still less expensive than the poke. It's a lot of food! Love the worker bees too. Go here. Get healthy.

The service at this place was ok. My two friends were happy with their choices (a\u0107ai bowl and avacado toast).\n\nI LOVE poke bowls I will order one almost anywhere that has one. The tuna was in massive chunks and buried underneath a bunch of wet and soggy seaweed. The entire dish was drenched in spicy mayo to the point that I couldn't taste anything else.   The last crime committed against this dish was the brown rice being hard. \n\nPossibly my fault for ordering a poke bowl at a place called The Juice Shop, but I feel like if you offer something on a menu it should atleast be on par.

Ingredients are missing from order or added even though you ask to leave it out, OR they call at the last minute to say they haven't got something when food should be on the way!!

While I was waiting I noticed the gluten free muffins, went back online and the cashier did not tell me the price nor did he ask for a signature or if I wanted a copy of my receipt.

The interior of the place is cute and modern, love the concept of the place, healthy is happy, is what i get from it. The worker that served me was nice, but I felt as if the service was slow and not present due to how customers didn't know when to buy because the workers would not be attentive to the register.

We ordered the berry acai bowl. It came with granola, strawberries, bananas \u0026 goji berries - typical toppings. The bowl itself was good and met my expectations. The price is a little steep for an acai bowl (~$10) but that's coming from someone who used to live in Orange County \u0026 the bowls were in the $6-8 range and an acai bowl shop can be found in every corner. \n\nOverall, the bowl was fine \u0026 did the job.

My husband and I sat aside while we waited for our order. We could see that there were a few people before us so we definitely knew patience would be key in this situation.\n\nSitting and waiting for about 15 mins, I notice similar orders being made that looked like what we ordered. But each one was handed off to someone else. We noticed the faces around us changing and then realized that people who had come in after us were being served. Again I see an order just like mine being made so I walk over it's handed to someone else. As I'm going to say something to the  cashier/food preparer she begins to ask me what did I order again. \"You can't be serious!\" \n\nNot only did you see me sitting there, you actually don't even have record of my order. An entire 40 minutes had passed. All with my husband and I being patient and this woman has the nerve to ask what I ordered again. Everyone else that walked in and waited had their order ticket taken care of.  \n\nI tell her my order she begins to attempt to make it but still with this nasty attitude. I ask for a refund, her response \"OK Cool.\" DEFINITELY NOT COOL MORON. She was unapologetic and very dismissive. I stood at the register waiting for my order. If it weren't  enough blatant disrespect already displayed, she then attempts to take someone else's order over me, before she issues my refund. I politely tell her \"that's rude, don't take an order over me before you're finished dealing with the situation at hand.\" \n\nShe had to then call her manager via her cell phone to ask how to issue a refund. The customer asked me how long I was waiting and for what, I told him and he left. Rightfully so. This place use to be a favorite and super convenient but has gone to the dogs. NOTE TO CORPORATE: DO NOT LEAVE UNRELIABLE UNPROFESSIONAL AND INCAPABLE STAFF TO HANDLE A SMALL SHOP LIKE THIS ON ANY DAY ESPECIALLY NOT A SATURDAY!\n\nI hate that I've had to result to a bad review as my first review ever. But this was a moment of outright disrespect and lack of accountability. Won't be going to any other Juice Shop again.\n\nEven if my ticket were lost, it was not addressed. The point is I was was looked over until I approached the cashier. And still faced with a nasty unapologetic attitude. That's my point. As I said I was patient already so what was so hard about having some courtesy and honesty in a place of business?!?!", "author": "Jessica B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-11", "description": "Juice shop is a great choice when craving a healthy kale bowl.  Tried a few of their options, my favorite is the Green curry which consists of coconut curry and butternut squash among other delicious items, yummy!   Have also tried a few of their soups (not my favorite), and chia pudding (favorite item in the store).  It sort of reminds me of chocolate pudding growing up as a child (way back in the 70s) lol. \n\nThe space is small, yet roomy enough to eat at one of their high table and stools.  The staff is friendly and helpful, will accommodate if you need to substitute an item in the pre-fixed menu.\n\nOverall great little spot to grab a fast healthy lunch.
