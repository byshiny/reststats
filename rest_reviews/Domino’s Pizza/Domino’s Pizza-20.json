I get made fun of ordering Domino's pizza especially living in NYC/Brooklyn where there are so many authentic choices available. However, Domino's hits the spot with its ordering efficiency via the web/app. I usually only do carry out/pick up and thus cannot comment on delivery times. Pizza taste and quality are okay.

They expect AT THE VERY LEAST to receive a refund for the full amount of the missing order.  But this will never happen.  What, never?  No never.\n\nI have come to this site to find that, alas, I am but the most recent in a string of late night robberies by those villains over on Smith Street.

I've lived in the neighborhood for five years, and I'm ashamed to admit that I keep making the mistake of doing it. They burn me, I take them out of rotation for 6 months or more, and then something will happen (like today, where I just got home from an 8 hour flight- an overseas trip full of hideous food, and I just wanted easy, cheesy, greasy comfort), and my misplaced optimism led me down the Dominos path. So they called today, right around the time they should have been at my door, to tell me they were out of Sprite. Seriously? How do you run out of Sprite? Whatever; I told them a Coke was ok. Then, when they delivered my order (Coke, cinna-stix, and a medium pan pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and green peppers), the pepperoni was missing from the pizza. When I called, they said that delivering the correct pizza would take at least another hour (and I had waited 45 minutes for the first one). And they refused to refund me, even though I didn't get what I ordered. \nThis is probably the third or fourth time they have delivered my pizza without the toppings I paid for in my online order. One time they took my order, and an hour later when I called to find out where it was, they told me I wouldn't be getting it because it was after closing and the drivers had gone home.\nSo many issues over the years, I just can't anymore.

My significant other also was hesitant for me to complain because he doesn't want to be on Domino's blacklist, but this is seriously, the worst service I have ever received in my life (no exaggeration). \n\nHere's what my letter to corporate looks like:\n\nDear Customer Relations at Domino's,\n\nIn good faith, I can say that I have grown up with you guys. Through thick and thin, from college days to my successful adult career, you've always been there. I've survived your old recipes, use of canned mushrooms, and the evaporation of your '30 minutes or it's free' moniker. I was OK with all that. Because I know you have a better product now and you have that cool online delivery tracker. \n\nBut an incident that happened on March 15, 2013, was quite honestly, the most degrading customer service I've ever received. \n\nI was running a huge project where I needed to cater lunch to a group of busy office workers that were so busy, we couldn't leave our office.\n\nI called up Domino's at 12:50pm. When I asked about the specials, he ran through them so fast and it was quite incoherent. I understand he's probably asked to repeat these all the time, but to me, I was paying attention and trying to make a decision from his words. I asked him to repeat one of the specials and was given the voice of irritation. So then I just decided to go ahead and order a basic large pizza, so we could move on. \n\n\"I would like the entire pizza with mushrooms on it. Then, half of it bacon and the other half sausage.\" I was asked three more times about what I wanted on my pizza, and I had to repeat this entire session. I'm not sure if this guy was new, but I think this is a moderately-easy pizza order. \n\nI was given a total and then sensing the staffer was going to hang up on me, I had to shout out, 'Hey! Do you know when I can expect this to be delivered??' \n\n\"Yeah, I'm going to tell you 45 minutes. Actually, no, an hour,\" he replied. \n\nI was pretty amazed at how long this order was going to take (is it easier to order from my local pizza shop?) but my hands were full and I didn't have time to call another place. I told the staffer, \"Thanks,\" and then told my hard-working yet hungry staff that it would be here in 45 minutes or so (I didn't have the heart to tell them an hour). \n\nSo we are all plowing through the lunch hour, and I check my watch, 2:18p. It's an hour and a half later? I call Domino's. I live on a main street, on the ground floor, in a place that's easy to find. Should I help the delivery guy? Did he get lost? \n\n\"Domino's. How can I help you?\"\n\n\"Hi, I ordered a pizza an hour and a half ago. I haven't seen it. Can you tell me what the status on this is please?\"\n\n\"Hmm, let me check. Did you order it online?\"\n\n\"No, I called in. My hands are too full to jump on a computer.\"\n\n\"Ok, what did you order?\"\n\n\"A large pizza. To address XX Smith St. Apt XX.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Ok, what toppings did you have?\"\n\n\"I don't quite remember.\" Honestly, I was just floored at the moment about where this conversation was going. \n\nAll of a sudden, a rushed voice came from this same guy (I have a trained ear in music, and I'm pretty sure that I spoke to the same guy both times on the phone with Domino's) and just quickly said, \n\"Ok, the order was not placed. Tell me what you want now and I will give you 50% and it will be there in 45 minutes.\"\n\nI was aghast. Seriously, no apologies, no explanations, it was almost 2:30 and my staff would have to eat lunch at 3:15???\n\nThis guy was obviously not the responsible type, so I calmly said,\"I am beyond furious right now. I have an entire group that has been patiently waiting.\"\n\n\"Well, I can get that order in now.\"\n\n\"No, that's OK. I can't wait that long. I have to call the shop closer to me, because I need something now. Also, can I have the name of your regional manager.\"\n\n\"He's on vacation right now.\"\n\n\"That's quite alright. May I have his name please?\"\n\n\"Tony.\" I could tell that he did not want to disclose this information. \n\n\"May I have his last name please?\"\n\n\"It's just Tony. And he's on vacation.\"\n\n\"Ok, not a problem. I will be sure to contact corporate to get in touch with Tony.\"\n\nAfter this calm conversation, he yells out, \"Oh yeah, well, you do that. Here, just call the number, 1 800 DOMINOS!\" \n\nI hang up.\n\nThe ridiculousness of this staffer who failed at his job, failed to deliver customer service information, and then decides to yell at me over the phone? I felt like I was disrespected and scoffed for trying to place an honest order and waited with a lot of patience. In return, I received a petulant answer that challenged me to file a complaint. \n\nI hope this level of service can turn around.
