The staff are very polite and experienced but the owner or manager (Julia) was beyond nasty to us upon walking up to ask for a table as well has her staff. I watched her belittle our waiter (who was lovely very good) in an unbelievable way. She was disgusted that we ordered 2 cocktails and a salad at 4pm. In between lunch and dinner. Wish we checked yelp before we sat as the 2 and 1/2 stars actually is too nice for this place. Fire julia or send her to anger management classes. Its the hospitality industry, not the \"be nasty make you feel uncomfortable industry\". FYI 45 year die hard New York and not a tourist opinion.

The host was standing around with his hands in his pockets while we waited for someone to clean the table and give us menus we had asked him for menus, but he said he has to wait until the table we were already sitting at was wiped down. So, my husband got up to get our own menus and still we waited for service, water, general acknowledgement, all of which never came, while the table seated after us (a set-up table)was given all. It seems there is something missing from management here.

I went on Christmas Night, so I understand some slowness but this was a whole new level. We sat for 20 minutes before even getting asked for drinks. Sat for another 20 waiting for water and bread. Then we were finally able to order. The waiter was nice but didn't get our order right, forgot the appetizer. The food was just bland. It looked GREAT, but it was very bland. They also don't have a dessert menu and it was so cramped in the restaurant. I was constantly hit by a waiter walking by or by other guests walking in or out. To top of the less than okay night, they do automatically include a 20% gratuity in their checks. I would have given at most 15% to this place.", "author": "Kurt P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-16", "description": "Very unimpressive. If you ask me my opinion I would wait online for Grimaldi's pizza. However me and my wife were having a beautiful day and thought a wine bar bistro style place would be much nicer on a summer day. There's some sort of conspiracy that didnt allow the staff to sit you inside even though we specifically asked for indoor seating.  Another couple made the same request seated outside. I'm sure there's many better places in Brooklyn to find tasty cuisine.", "author": "Mike B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "The mozzarella caprese was great! Friendly service and the linguini was yummy, the sauce was very good and the shrimp were big!

Mediterranean/French...yes, please. My friend ordered the house salad with arugula, candied walnuts and avocado, I ordered the tomato mozzarella caprese app to start. A most unfortunate choice--the mozzarella was flavorless and rubbery, the tomatoes unripe and topped with a measly 2 barely discernible pieces of basil. My friend fared somewhat better with her salad, but that caprese was the worst I ever had.\n\nMains: My friend had the fettuccini, I had the rigatoni. Let's just say one could do better with a box of Barilla pasta and a jar of Raoul's. Also I was horrified when the waitress came by to offer cheese (ooh, I thought, freshly grated Parmesan)--and it was of the prefab dried sawdust variety.\n\nLong story short, the food was underwhelming, lacking in flavor, and ridiculously overpriced. And for two people (a party of 2, I say!) each having one glass of wine, a salad and a simple pasta main, the bill came to $100. That's including the 20% \"service\" fee they added to our bill. Excuse me but since when did maximum gratuity become a mandatory charge? We weren't a large party by any stretch of the imagination and the service was okay, but certainly not great. I probably would have left a 15% tip had we been left with any choice in the matter.\n\nOf course the view is absolutely fantastic. But restaurants on the waterfront have got to stop taking advantage of this fact, especially if they can't offer halfway decent food. I'd have sooner paid 5 times as much to dine at The River Caf\u00e9 less than a block away than pay a penny to eat at this sad establishment.\n\n$50 poorer and now suffering from tummy troubles, I will never eat here again.", "author": "Esther L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-27", "description": "The woodwork is lovely... of course, a bit overboard, but you have to go with it since it was the times. The staff is friendly, and the food works. We ended up going to this place b/c the pizza line was a bit too long. The hard part is reviewing a place after you've been anxiously hoping for something else. I try to be subjective, but COME ON - I wanted pizza.\n\nThe clam spaghetti was pretty tasty - certainly not the best I've ever had, but not too shabby either. I make a pretty good clam spaghetti, so if I say it's \"not too shabby\", that's actually a serious complement. The wine selection was good enough, and we walked out of there without breaking the bank. So overall, it wasn't too bad of a replacement for pizza. A little heartbroken not to get the pizza? Yes. Wasting calories on tasteless food? Nope.\n\nThe thing that did kinda annoy me (the reason we couldn't hang in the pizza line is that we had somewhere to be) was that it took a while to get our bill. The place was a little too empty for that kind of nonsense.", "author": "Martha R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-06", "description": "Don't go here. Second time here. Bad experience. Surely if a staff member has a hygiene issue as a boss you should feel compelled to not only HELP this individual but also be concerned with your customers comfort.
