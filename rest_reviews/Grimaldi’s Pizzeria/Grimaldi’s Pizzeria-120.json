The menu is very simple, and the pizza is perfection. I've been to this place 3 times, and is where I always take anyone who's visiting Brooklyn for the first time.\n\nAfter dinner, I recommend heading over to Brooklyn Bridge Park for a great walk, and taking in the beautiful views!", "author": "Sarah M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-06", "description": "(YC2017, 74/100)\nSome of the best pizza I've ever had!  We were surprised there was literally no wait when we came here one night and were seated upstairs immediately.  You can watch the magic of the pizza making happen on the first floor right in front of everybody.  The staff here is a little brash with that whole stereotypical NY-personality, but they get the job done.  \n\nWe ended up ordering a large White Pizza with +Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes.  The toppings are added individually and will cost you ~$2-$4.  If I were to make one recommendation, it would be to get the WHITE pizza.  I've had the red as well, and although it was good, the white was amazing!  The pizza only took about 10-15 minutes to come out and it was so good - the slices were large and the crust was thin but had a bit of chewiness to it.  The mozzarella cheese was very prevalent and the toppings we chose went perfect together.  Sharing this pizza among two people, there were about three slices leftover, so I would say one large pizza could feed three people.  We also ordered the Cannoli, and we did not like it at all.  It was way too creamy and the cream was a bit rough in texture.\n\nThey weren't kidding when they said Grimaldi's had the best pizza in the NY.  For me, they even took the crown for the best pizza anywhere!  Great quality at a fair price - would recommend.", "author": "Jeff T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-01-20", "description": "Despite being 14 degrees out, there was a line outside.  Not enough room for a line inside, it's tight.  \n\nAfter a bit of a wait and the loss of an extremity or two, we went inside, looking forward to stabilizing our body temperature along with that authentic Brooklyn pizza.  It was unexpectedly cold inside, and we were seated next to a drafty window that enticed us to leave our coats on.  Almost as cold inside as it was outside.  We were told that, since it's a historic building, they were limited in what they could do to weatherproof it better.  \n\nWe decided on two large pizzas for four people.  It seemed a bit much, but we wanted the variety.  We suspected we may wind up with some extra, but a large is only $2 more than a small. \n\nWhile we waited, one of our party noticed other pizzas being brought out with a darker or charred crust.  He was able to catch our waiter and request ours lighter.  Good call for us, but YMMV\n\nOkay, I had this review pending / started, and I'm stopping it right here. Pizza was good, but they were just closed for health violations.  Two stars:  one star rating for the health violations, bumped up to two stars because I didn't see any mouse droppings on our pizza, but wasn't looking for them, either.

This pizza is by far my favorite thin crust pizza in NYC or East Coast for that matter. Way better than the over rated Pepe Pizza in New Haven, Connecticut. The sauce is extremely flavorful and makes it. It is coal fired and NOT burned at the bottom. It has a nice chew that is super. I love this pizza! Excellent.

I waited for quite long for our pizza to come out--I guess around 25 min. But what came out was probably the best pizza I've ever had. Fresh tomato sauce and mushroom, gooey cheese filling, delicious pepperoni on a perfectly baked thin crust--altogether they make a great pizza! The freshness of the taste really was impressive. And the brick oven truly makes a difference! A small pizza ($16) with two toppings ($2 each) easily fed us two (but we are no ferocious eaters).", "author": "Leila L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-24", "description": "All hype with no substance. We ordered a margherita pie to go since the line for dine in would be hours long. The wait time for the pie itself was 20-30 min. Other pizza establishments that specializes in pizzas with coal/wood brick ovens takes about 10-15 min, and that's during peak times. The dough of the pizza was slightly above above average. It doesn't have the air bubbles in the crust and pie itself, almost as though the dough wasn't given enough time to rise. The mozzarella-- we expected only the best ingredients and the mozzarella didn't taste fresh. Lastly the sauce-- the sauce I felt could do better with having mini chunks of tomatoes, instead it was tomato pur\u00e9e.  \n\n\nWas this pizza absolutely terrible? No it wasn't. But would I wait in line for hours for this? Absolutely not.

The lady asked me what I wanted and i asked how many slices is a large and she replied rudely 8. I told her I wanted a large plain pie. She didn't ask my name and said 30 minutes and hung up. I get there, and the nice security guy directed me to a Sandra-Bernhard looking woman. I gave her my card and I asked I ordered a personal pie (honest mistake on my part) and she replied with the BIGGEST attitude we don't do that. I said sorry I meant a large plain pie. She asked my name three times throughout this convo too (not that hard, it's Michelle) and I said I ordered a pie 20 minutes ago and she asked if I called the right place and tried to brush me off. I told her the number and I had the right one (just like I thought). Lady went oh guess you did call. And told me my order will take 20 minutes...so I sat there and decided to write this review. I'm all about women empowerment but this lady was straight up a b****. (Can't also help but think you kept assuming I didn't understand English because I'm Asian..repeated things as if I were dumb) I probably won't be a patron of this establishment again...unless she's gone. \n\n Baker must have heard our convo, because pizza came out in five min and she gave it to me.\n\nPizza was cool though. However this experience has definitely made me more biased..never thought it spectacular but now it's closer to the average end.
