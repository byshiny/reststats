No line- score! \nI respect the faithful followers, however I can't claim to be one.\n\nSee my pizza list if you care to delve into my hardcore pie philosophy:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/list/connecticut-pizza-fairfield\n\nThe pie was good. Not super good or even slightly great. Simply my opinion. \nWhen it arrived (in less than 4 minutes which made me suspect) was a thing of beauty- the colors of the Italian flag all red white \u0026 green....The fresh mozzarella all bright white \u0026 melty w the specks of red tomato peeking through with a smattering of blistered green basil splayed out on a very thin crust.\nFoldable, a bit dry, charred crust, slight chew. But my taste-buds were left feeling uh, disappointed. No party in my mouth that's for sure.\nThis is wholly not NYC style pizza despite its infamous location. It's certainly closer to the Neapolitan style.\nThe interior is well, not worth mentioning, so apparently it has no influence on why people wait 2+ hrs to get in.\nThe service was brisk, impersonal \u0026 we were overcharged by $12.", "author": "Debrin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-19", "description": "As a once ardent FAN of this ORIGINAL LOCATION... I wish I could give this once great pizza mecca ZERO stars...  What's happened here?\n\nFirst off... The big bald headed *cough* \"manager\" who thinks he's GOD running the front door and his old Russian a-hole boyfriend behind the bar (The only seat they would give me me because I was a \"party of one\") BOTH need to BEG the owners to let them visit ANY of their company owned locations that have opened here in Dallas. (Or others around the country)\n\nMaybe then... They can learn what THE REAL Grimaldi's USED TO BE, (And still IS here...) along with what Customer Service is all about. (YES..  At their Dallas location, you actually get REAL PLATES, silverware, and a full menu...salads, desserts... ETC)  The Pizza is BRICK OVEN AWESOME!  AND THEY TAKE CREDIT CARDS AND RESERVATIONS!!\n\nTHIS CRAP JOINT is now nothing but a \"herd em in\", \"herd em out\" \"Take THE CASH ONLY\" tourist trap.  Paper Plates, a plastic f'n fork, and a throwaway plastic cup for water with NO F'N ICE in it???  REALLY???  \n\nAnd then when you give the jerk $30 to pay for a 22$ pie... He acts OFFENDED that you want some change back...  I guess you should feel HONORED to have been \"ripped off under the bridge\" just because you GOT to eat here!\n\nScrew this place!  I'd rather heat up a $2 Totinos Frozen Pizza in a toaster oven.  Or better yet... Go to Bleecker St. Pizza next time I'm back in the city.  \n\nGrimaldi's Brooklyn has gotten my last dime ever.  And that's a shame.   20 years ago... I'd HAVE NEVER dreamed I'd be writing this.  I'm sure they won't care about this review...  Priorities have changed here over the years...

I've never seen pepperonis like this in my life and they.were.incredible. \n\nOn top of this, despite the crowd, our waiter was fantastic. We were worried about being late to a 7pm show (Sleep No More!), so he was very accommodating in rushing our pizza and cannolis. \n\nWhile the pizza was fantastic, I don't love that the soda was in bottles.

However, I came here because an out of town friend loves pizza. Grimaldi's, the famous pizza everyone knows about did not meet up to its hype. First off, cash only. That's a no-no in my books. Also, paper plates, plastic cups and utensils? I expect more from a place if there's a wait.

I'm not saying this just because I'm from Chicago and we're known for our pizza (not to mention I've  lived in Italy and have been spoiled by the pizza there), but I KNOW this because Chicagoans are ALL about their pizza AND we know good pizza when we taste it AND I've had way better NY pizza than this. Granted, all ingredients are and taste fresh, but the flavor is very plain even after building my own pizza with the exact ingredients I wanted--where is the flavor? It kinda made me regret not pulling a couple seasonings from my kitchen cabinet and packing them in my purse before arrival. The property itself and the building's rich history is WAY more fascinating than this pizza. Don't believe the hype-- or do, if it makes you feel good. Never again will I stand in this line for over an hour for this pizza. The service was nothing to be remembered. No one was particularly nice, but no one was mean or rude either. I really don't even remember the waiter- nothing special about the service. However, I will give Grimaldi's kudos to their marketing team, they've got some serious promoters and Word of Mouth cheerleaders out in the city hyping this place up for many years. That's amazing! Without that accomplishment, less than three stars from me. I really wanted to love this pizza and make this my staple pizza place in Brooklyn because I really love NY style pizza (eh, shoot me, I tell my fellow Chicagoans this too!).

We were seated. Drinks and food was served. And check. Thats it. 2 times i had to get up to go to the counter to ask for refills. Another time i had to get up and ask for the check after waiting 15mins.\n\nWhats worse is that the server tried to throw out the rest of the pizza that i was trying to get wrapped for togo. The pizza itself was mediocre at best. Its bread, tomato sauce and cheese they charge you 14$ for\n\nNO CARDS with $5 ATM surcharge. The old man bouncer was rude to majority of customers mainly non whites. ( i kid you not and put it on everything i love ) calling people dumbfucks and gooks behind their backs after rushing ti seat them. I may not be itlian but i sure know what the term mulignan means. ( look it up for yourself ) \n\nOverall a tourist trap for NYC. Seriously self proclaimed best pizza, if you are from NYC there are about 10,000 other better restaurants that treat customers with dignity.

Yeah it was worth it. Place is old school and the pizza is really good. I know pizza can be a polarizing topic with some people (especially in Brooklyn) but I'd definitely put this joint in the top ten for me personally.
