The Asian girl at the counter was super nice, friendly, \u0026 helpful. The crepe itself is delicious because they have so many different types of fillings.

Definitely try their matcha strip chocolate and lychee valentine crepe. Also, their yuzu soda and matcha shake are very nice as well!!! There's very little space in the place but it is decorated very nicely with the room it's given. Haven't tried any of their savory crepes but I'm sure it's amazing too!", "author": "Sabrina L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-10", "description": "Not sure what the big deal is. I ordered delivery using Uber Eats from this place since it had good reviews. The crepe arrived a bit dry with lots of nuts. I asked for berries but there were no berries. Anyway, I was very disappointed. I usually get Japanese crepes from T-Swirl, and this one just doesn't compare. This one is dry, thicker, and just doesn't have the same \"oomph\". A bit disappointing. Not sure why the reviews are so positive. These days almost every place has 5 star ratings on Yelp.", "author": "Pearl M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-29", "description": "Best crepes I've tasted!

Too bad it didn't live up to expectations. I got the Truffled Egg White crepe ($9.25 with tax), with truffled mushrooms, egg whites, truffle oil, spinach, and special tofu sauce. It was a perfectly good crepe--stuffed with fillings, slightly chewy and even a bit sweet-- but there was no truffle taste whatsoever. The egg whites were pretty bland, and the tofu sauce just tasted like mayonnaise, which I strongly dislike. Plus the paper cone in which it came was hard to tear, so eating the crepe was a challenge in itself. \n\nStill, the sweet crepes sound tasty enough for me to come back. I definitely want to try the Matcha Stripe and NY Cheesecake! Seating is limited, but staff are very friendly and don't attempt to rush you out. Make sure you ask for a plastic wrap around the paper cone, as the crepe started to drip all over me halfway through my lunch.", "author": "Cat K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-18", "description": "Soo good and gluten free.

Cr\u00eapes aren't overly sweet, and the flavors I've had so far have been on point. Lychee valentine was a good balance of fruity and floral. Matcha stripe chocolate was also yummy especially with the chocolate truffle bites. Love the tart yogurt sauce they use in the sweet cr\u00eapes -- makes it seem healthier! Maybe it's a psychological thing. \n\nFriends got savory cr\u00eapes and also had good things to say about them.\n\nThe only thing I wish they had is more seating room.

This place had been on my list of places to go to for desert for a long time. Finally made it there this week. I was not disappointed!  I had the matcha stripe sweet crepe with an added scoop of green tea ice cream recommended by the dude at the counter. Great advice to add it. It was awesome!  The crepes are perfect texture with great taste. All the ingredients inside of the crepe were delicious.  The combination of everything together plus the cone shape was perfect!  Easy to eat; I ate it like a panini.  It wasn't sloppy, stayed together throughout.

This was actually suggested by someone when I was looking for new places to eat before my trip.\n\nEight Turn Crepe is in the same block as Rice to Riches and Lombardi's Pizza. So even if I didn't hear about it, I would've easily spotted it since it's right by the 6 train and on the way to Rice Riches.\n\nSo the dilemma was, how do we fit all that food that these three places are all in the same block? That's what your second stomach is for... for desserts.\n\nWHAT WE ORDERED:\n*Azuki Berries Crepe: The main reason why we picked this: it came with matcha gelato! If there's anything green tea on the menu, that's most likely what I would be ordering 99% of the time. The crepe came with strawberries, azuki beans, whipped yogurt, matcha custard creme, slivered almonds, and pocky sticks. The presentation is obviously super kawaii. It's a little bit more compact compared to the crepes that I get at Harajuku crepes in LA. The texture of the crepe also kinda threw me off a little though since it wasn't the usual smooth crepe texture since it's a rice crepe. Nonetheless, it was delicious! I liked the matcha custard creme with the azuki beans. They also neatly roll the crepe and put it in a paper pouch, so eating it on the go is not such a hot mess. I think ice cream cones are overrated and ice cream or gelato should really be eaten in a crepe cone :D.\n\nThe restaurant is super tiny. Like two bar seats, tiny. The place was empty when we went, so we were able to enjoy our crepes inside the store and people watch since you're facing Spring St. It's cute how they have \"crepes\" inside a cloche displayed in their store-front window. It kinda reminded me of Beauty and the Beast... you know when Beast had his precious rose? \n\nAnother go-to dessert spot for me in New York!", "author": "Anne D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-25", "description": "My second favorite crepe place so far.
