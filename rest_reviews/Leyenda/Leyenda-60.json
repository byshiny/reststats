A beautiful sunny Thursday night. All we wanted was to sit outside and enjoy the evening. Let's hit up Leyenda, we thought, they've got that great backyard! We arrive and the hostess can't seem to get it together enough to give us a wait time for an outdoor table. She was super vague and unhelpful and said maybe an hour but who knows....as though it was possible that no table might open up at all for the entire night. Sketchy. We decide to wait anyway and she tells us we're on the list for an outdoor table. We grab a drink at the bar. Then a snack. Then another drink. An hour goes by. Nothing. Suddenly I witness with my own two eyes, two women walk into the restaurant and ask for a table outside. They are immediately taken outside and seated. UM what!?!?!?! It was unbelievable. A table had opened up and was given to people who happened to walk in rather than the couple who had been waiting patiently for over an hour. When I asked the hostess what the hell had just happened she couldn't have seemed to care less. She said it was a \"misunderstanding\" and comped two of our drinks and that was it. She acted as though we were ridiculous to be seriously bothered by the fact that she lied to our faces and wasted our time and money. Anyway, this place stinks and we will never return due to this horrendous service.", "author": "Sol C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-14", "description": "Once upon a time, my slightly drunken but always classy wife texted me, \"Come meet us! We're at Leyenday!\"\n\nWell, that was a somewhat prophetic typo because that evening, and all other subsequent Smith Street evenings at this fine establishment, have combined 'Leyenda' with 'Yay!' Because this joint kicks ass. \n\nTo elaborate on that, here is a short list of Things I've Never Had At Leyenda:\n\n1. A bad cocktail. From the nearly always appropriate Sonambula to the very boozy Cabezaso or the mezcal-based Lil' Smokey (perhaps my favorite so far), the cocteles are impeccable. The 'Dem Apples is a nice seasonal one, if you're into that. Try a mezcal flight if nothing appeals to you, and expand your mind, man.\n\n2. Bad service. The bartenders (including Ivy Mix, somewhat of a celebrity in the world of alcohol) don't just know their biz, they offer up genuinely friendly smiles that are only outdone by the adorable sweetheart who was running food this past Tuesday evening. She was more excited than I was about the tinga tacos I was getting, which is quite frankly, incredible.\n\n3. My appendix out. I don't think they offer that service here. \n\n4. Anything half-assed. Thought and care has gone into every aspect of this place, and I appreciate it. The effect of the candlelight reflecting off the gorgeous golden ceiling makes me want to sit in my seat and sip mezcal forever. Not even the garnishes are afterthoughts, but rather careful additions (candied ginger, dried apples, cooked pineapple) that add a little more complexity to already deliciously complex drinks.\n\n5. Bad food. The plates are beautiful and for the most part, very tasty, Pupusas, flautas, arepas, empanadas...all damn good accompaniment to the booze, which is the star of the show in this particular establishment. I imagine the croquetas are good as well, as it seems that I like anything that ends in \"as.\" I have yet to make a decision about the panuchos or the rellenos. \n\nIt's safe to say that I will be back, soon and often.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-16", "description": "Came here for a Girls nite hang out.\nLove the decor especially the back wall with the last supper painting all over it. \nDrinks were nice nothing special. \nThis place is small and cute \nThe guacamole and chips were not the best guac needs more seasoning and salt. \nStaff was cool and engaging which is always a plus. \nGood location and good prices.\nI would like to give it a second chance and have different dishes to see if they can redeem themselves.", "author": "Christine H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-14", "description": "Cute place but very expensive for what it is. $10 for a few chips and 1/2 an avocado and tiny salsa.

Today I stopped by with a couple friends for brunch. This review rates all my experiences.\n\nThey recently revamped their menu and it seems to be a lot better than it was. Their cocktails are very creative and aren't light on the alcohol. They have a decent selection of beers as well. For brunch we had a salad, a fried chicken sandwich and guacamole and chips. All of it was good. I'm generally not a fan of fried chicken and I wasn't today either, but that's more of a personal preference.\n\nThe place itself has a very cool ambience, especially if you sit by the bar you get to watch their awesome bartenders in action. They have a decent amount of seating. In the summer they have a garden area that they open up if the weather is good.\n\nI'll definitely be stopping by here again in the future.", "author": "Subodh M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-25", "description": "Reading the reviews of this place and wanting to complete my own very important goal of eating at every Mexican restaurant in brooklyn I was excited to try this \"new\" restaurant, to quickly cross it off my list. \nPerhaps my bias against \"fancy\" mercian kicked in but this place just left me wanting to go grab a taco from a truck a near by. The Papusas were inauthentic and tasteless. The mango empanada was ok, if I can say from the one bite sized serving I was given. \nMy fianc\u00e9 got the pork tacos which looked delicious but were flavorless and we spent 15 minutes waiting for a waitress to come by to get some salt and salsa. \nThe restaurant has a lovely back yard and drink menu is impressive with a great happy hour. My suggestion is drinks with chips and guac as an appetizer before embarking on your dinner at another restaurant.", "author": "Megan R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-12", "description": "Really liked the pork tacos.

The tamale is incredible, and the drinks are solid. However, the service is really, really bad. We had to ask for chips four times before we got any, and the rest of our food came at a similar pace. For instance, we were here almost an hour here before we got a new water pitcher. Without the slow service, this would be a four or five star review. But if you're going to come here, be prepared to have to remind your server several times to bring you your order.", "author": "Ari C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-15", "description": "First time visiting on recommendation of a friend.

My friends and I had the opportunity to sample a plethora of different cocktails from some of the biggest names around town, and one of Leyenda's drinks, La Son\u00e1mbula, was our hands down favorite of the night. After my experience there, I had it on my to-do list to visit the actual location.\n\nI've now been multiple times, and could not be more impressed. Absolutely love the space - the place is always abuzz, yet still feels intimate no matter whether you're seated at the bar, along the window, or at the tables. I could definitely see the place as a cute date spot. The cocktails here are all winners. My favorite as mentioned above, La Son\u00e1mbula, is excellent - comprised of \"Jalape\u00f1o infused blanco tequila, lemon, chamomile, mole \u0026 Peychaud's bitters.\" It is just the perfect amount of spicy and sweet, and I always get at least one each time I come. The Tia Mia is also another favorite of mine. Food is surprisingly good - I always get the chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips are crisp and thick which I love, the salsa fresh, and I dig the guacamole that's served in an emptied out avocado shell. I usually get the pork tacos - each comes stuffed with meat, and are delicious. Service is attentive and prompt, which is impressive considering how busy the place gets. During my times there, have never felt rushed either.\n\nJulie Reiner and Ivy Mix have a real winner on their hands here, and I am so glad they've opened Leyenda in the neighborhood - if you love cocktails, you definitely need to check this place out; you won't be disappointed :)", "author": "Gene L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-18", "description": "Best cocktails and small bites in the area.
