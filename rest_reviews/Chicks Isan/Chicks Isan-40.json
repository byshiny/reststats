The food is super flavorful so it's not for the faint of heart. Highlight items were grilled Isan chicken, which was soo juicy. The larb moo was so on point especially eaten with the sticky rice. Lastly, the papaya salad is so aromatic and tasty even when the spice level was next level. I will def go back for more!", "author": "Jessica S."}], "servesCuisine": "Thai", "priceRange": null, "name": "Chicks Isan", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "445 Albee Square W", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/V-Eh9kcMpRAdSWYDqCmQGA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+19293881131"}
