When the restaurant first opened, I had one meal here but it was only meh.  Tonight we wanted to give this place another chance as it is one of the few spots in the area serving Mexican food and open until 1AM (so it says online).  We went in at 1140, the place was a mess. Napkins and dirty cups everywhere.  We were told to go to the bar in order to get faster service. Okay, short staffing happens... However, the bartender said it was last call, nearly an hour and a half before closing.  We left and notified the hostess as we were walking out and she acted like we were annoying her.  The place closes at 1145, advertise it as such.  Wipe your bar.  Don't give customers attitude when they're just asking to be served.  Simple stuff.", "author": "dreamsincolor e."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-02", "description": "So this review is based on two lunches, both times consisting of excellent guacamole and decent tacos that are nothing special- I've had far better from the taco truck near industry city for far less money.

Stayed for three days in nyc and I've been here two out of the three because it's so good. Alex made our guacamole today and it was phenomenal yet his manager came up to him and put him down in front of our entire group making us all very uncomfortable to the point that we needed to praise Alex to make him feel great about the amazing food he made us. My group and I have all been in the restaurant industry and we have never been so appalled witnessing a manager Do this to a new hire in front of guests. ALEX YOU ARE WONDERFUL AND YOUR BOSS NEEDS MORE TRAINING NOT YOU! Also thank you to the bartender for making us specialty Margs!

If you've heard about this restaurant having over 400 bottles of Tequila and were skeptical, I guarantee your faith will be restored. The restaurant is fairly large. They have a bar the length of 1/2 a city block and an even larger dining area on the main floor. Downstairs is a whole different world as well. \n\nThe happy has mid-shelf cocktails and bites as well. $2 off cocktails with quality ingredients; large glasses as well. The only problem I had was with my Tequila Lemonade. I applaud them for trying and having a nice presentation, but usually tequila doesn't go with lemon. And to mask the taste, they used agave syrup....a lot of agave syrup. No exaggeration, but it felt like diabetes in a glass. I brought it to the attention of the bartender so he would know for future mixes. He agreed that it was too sweet and did his best to dilute the drink further. I appreciate that he did this. Didn't help, but I'm usually a bigger fan of service than food (55/45). \n\nIf you like tequila and want to taste a new bottle that you didn't know existed, I'd recommend this place. I'll consider coming back in the area if they're running a special or I'm seriously craving Mexican food that day.", "author": "Greg J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-08", "description": "The food is definitely good but so overpriced!! 7.00 tacos is crazy.

It's a brilliant concept. You bring people from different walks of life a place they get drunk at. Behind it is the courthouse next to it is the Marriott hotel.

However the level downstairs has a different kind of upscale feel to it with individual dining rooms that have their own themes, I'm assuming for groups. \n\nMy husband claimed the men bathroom had pictures of playboy models in them. The women bathroom had tiny screens in the stalls that play movies. \n\nTheir queso fundido is amazing and the taquitos are just as good. The tres leche cake is moist and just as delicious. Service for me has been great every time.\n\nIf you're in Brooklyn, you need to check this place out.
