They were very well prepared and tasted great.  I also ordered the supposed spicy soup (the guy warned us about the heat), but it was flavorless and barely had any heat.  The meat in the soup was also very bland and the noodles meh. Don't order the soup.\n\nThe service was also not great.  We ate inside, and the young guy at the counter gave us what looked like two or three toilet paper square sized sheets for napkins. When we asked for a bowl so my buddy and I could share the soup, the guy asked for 25 cents for the crappy container.  It was extremely weird.\n\nThis place is cash only, so bring some money with.", "author": "Miguel S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-07", "description": "Poor quality dumplings. The boiled dumplings were clearly made with pre-made wrappers, not house made dough. There was too little chive in the chive-pork dumplings. Consequently, they were rather flavorless.\nThe pan-fried (guotieh) were basically the same dumplings as the boiled. Guo tieh should have thinner skins than standard boiled dumplings because the pan cooking process requires less constant contact with water. The dumplings themselves were not cooked properly, lacking the crisp delicate underside and not lightly stuck to each other as they would be if the proper cooking method were used. They appeared to have been thrown into the pan after they were pre-cooked just to brown up the bottoms. Properly made guo-tieh are at least twice as long as boiled dumplings and cannot be eaten in one bite.\nThe pan-fried buns had the same problem as the pan-fried dumplings. Filling was under-chived. Buns were made ahead of time and then heated up. As with guo-tieh, there should be a delicate crisp underside with a soft and tender upper. These had neither.\nNext time, I'm taking the subway trek to Nan Xiang or Wah Fung for my good eats.", "author": "John H T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-16", "description": "The dumplings are great! Very well-done, and affordable. Everything else on the menu is also affordable-- I have tried the vegetable fried rice and peanut noodles, however, and both were overly greasy and with no other substantial ingredients other than the grains.

What keeps the place planted firmly in 3 star territory is the fact the, unlike many of the legendary Chinatown spots, the quality here is somewhat inconsistent.  I have sampled some dumplings here that are of perfectly acceptable condition, but on occasion, particularly with the boiled variety, which is the one I am most apt to order, have received dumplings which have been overcooked to the point that the skins basically fall apart when they are pierced with the plastic utensils, leaving the innards exposed with the wrappings strewn around them as if they were Italian Gnudi, albeit the opposite of al dente.  Still, with prices this low can you really complain too much without feeling pretty ridiculous?", "author": "Brendan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-21", "description": "Before I even get to how the food was I have to start by stating that everything I ordered here was lukewarm or cold. At first glance my eyes popped out of my head because the prices are DIRT cheap. \n\n4 fried dumplings for $1\nSesame Pankcake sandwiches for $2 and UNDER\nSoups for $3 and UNDER\n\nPoint is this place is CHEAPPPP. I tried the fried chive \u0026 pork dumplings (4 for $1) and they were cold. On top of that when you bit into them oil came flying out and got everywhere. All over my face, eating surface, hands, etc. I couldn't even finish all four because of how oily they were. Inside of each dumpling the pork is sitting in a pool of oil. It just left me grossed out and with a stomachache considering all the oil I just ingested.   \n\nAlso tried both the beef and pork sesame pancakes. I enjoyed the beef. The pancake itself is a lot more doughy than i'm use to getting in Chinatown. As for the pork pancake it was okay but a little to fatty for me personally. (but I tend to find pork fatty in general....I usually just stick to BACON)\n\nThe service here is nice and it's quick. They can get a crowd during lunch hours during the weekday with all the business people and colleges in the area. \n\nSomeone told me I should try the boiled dumplings because they are made on the spot as oppose to the fried ones which take longer so they have to fry them in advance (hence why they were cold) so next time I'll try that. \n\nAll in all you can fill yourself here for UNDER $5 and still leave with change....how many places can you really say that about these days?", "author": "Roj\u00e9 G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-05", "description": "These dumplings are incredible, i've had all their varieties... fried, steamed, pork and chive, pork and cabbage and you absolutely cannot go wrong.

Grab a menu when you walk in and know what you're ordering when you get to the front of the line.

The last 3 times I had an allergic reaction even though what I ordered suppose to contain no shellfish. I believe they mix cooking tools with food with shellfish.\n\nTried this place the first time after yelp reviews and proximity to work. Ordered the chicken, mushroom \u0026 cabbage fried dumplings (#5) and mixed veggie noodle soup (#23). Dumplings were good. Not too salty or mushy. Veggie soup was also good. Fresh ingredients and was not overwhelming. \n\nA very local place. Customers knows the routine and I tried to follow the crowd and blend in. I like the simple menu. Straightforward and no frills.
