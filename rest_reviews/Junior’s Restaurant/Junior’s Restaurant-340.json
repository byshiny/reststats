Overall, we were slightly disappointed, since this place is so hyped up. Their cheesecake is too decadent and I didn't find anything exceptional about it. \n\nInstead of buying your cheesecake, google: Michael Symon Pretzel Crust Cheesecake. Super easy to make and better than most (actually, all) commercially sold cheesecakes. \n\nWe're glad we came, because we had to try the famous Junior's cheesecake. However, we probably won't return. \n\np.s. parking is a nightmare in the area", "author": "Ilona K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-13", "description": "The was wonderful.

We were staying nearby so it was within perfect walking distance for breakfast. The dining room is extensive, but it wasn't too busy when we were seated. \n\nFood came out quickly and we also enjoyed the complimentary pastries. The menu is classic with favorable choices. We ordered Hot Cakes plate w/bacon and Eggs plate that came with bacon, potatoes, and toast. The portions were large, especially the pancakes. My dining companion loved that there was a lot of maple syrup available to douse the cakes (and bacon) with. Speaking of bacon, it was plentiful. That's the way all diners \u0026 restaurants should serve bacon--stacked and crisp. And their home fries were probably some of the best breakfast potatoes we've ever had. For our whole order, prices were decent for what we got. \n\nThe staff was nice and attentive, especially when refilling drinks. Unfortunately we were so full from our meals that we couldn't handle cheesecake, but everything from the bakery near the entrance looked delicious. \n\nJunior's is a nice place to eat not only for visitors, but also for locals, as we saw a few of them being served while we dined.", "author": "Christel L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-15", "description": "This place gets a 4 and its for one reason only! The cheesecake!!! Yes!! It's everything you've heard it is! Yes it's worth walking to from Manhattan like Diddy made the members of Making the Band do! \n\nI've had the food here and it's not that great very standard diner food with 4 star restaurant prices. Wayyy to expensive but I guess you pay for the name. \n\nSo if your going to be over changed for the name you might as well get what they are known for! THE CHEESECAKE!!!! I've had the original and the chocolate and both are amazing! They have lots of other flavors but the original is still best!!!

The host walked by about 10 minutes after we were seated and offered to take our order when he noticed we were server-less. Luckily, he brought us some cornbread to munch on while we waited.\n\nI ordered their cheeseburger which was hefty, for lack of a better word. My friend had the Chx Caesar Salad. Both were great and portions were large! Eventually, another employee who also noticed that we were abandoned offered to bring us takeout boxes... and then never came back.\n\nThe bus boy, who did not utter a single word, brought us more cornbread (which is a nice consolation prize for our invisible waiter) and we requested those boxes we were promised. Our substitute server came back and apologized for the mess at which point I handed her my credit card and asked for a slice of cheesecake (which was basically the only reason why we came). There was a concern that I may never see her again but at this point I didn't care if I had to call Visa to cancel my account--I wanted out. Much to my surprise she came back with both the card and the cheesecake and all was right with the world again. I'll make sure to place a to-go order next time...", "author": "Jinah Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-18", "description": "Fun place and great food.

Excellent location in the heart of downtown Brooklyn. I really enjoyed the 1950's atmosphere and decor. The service was very polite and friendly. My food came out quickly. I highly recommend the Matzoh ball soup and the original cheesecake. This is the best cheesecake I've ever had; it literally melts in your mouth.

Portions are beyond ginormous... we each ordered an entree and then latkes to share. Wish the waiter had told us how big the potato pancakes were because really, one would have been enough! I had the blintzes, but could only eat one and a half (so rich!) and my friend had a giant sandwich. I had a chocolate egg cream (a NY must!). Too full for dessert, but we stopped by the bakery counter on the way out since my friend wanted treats for later.

We came in on Christmas, we were quickly seated, except we were by the door where we felt draft come in constantly. Along side this the server was relatively rude, with grabbing menus and grabbing my friends hand in a rough manner while retrieving the menus. My order was ignored about checking on the double chocolate chip pound cake. I ended up receiving a chocolate swirl cheese cake. It was delightful, too bad the service isn't as great as the cake.", "author": "Freddy G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-17", "description": "So this place is kind of a tourist trap, but it's also kinda awesome.  \n\nNot only does Junior's have a storied history, it looks like it has a storied history.  The place looks straight out of an early Quentin Tarantino movie, i.e., unchanged from the 60's and 70's.   \n\nI had split pea soup.  It was good.  Not amazing, but good.  Surprisingly, they have a pretty good selection of local craft brews, too.   Junior's main claim to fame is their cheese cake.   I can't it's unjustified.  I'm not a huge fan of the cake \"crust\" (as opposed to a hard crust), but the body of the cheesecake was so smooth and airy.   It wasn't too sweet and wasn't too sharp.

I got their famous strawberry cheesecake and it really wasn't all its hyped up to be. Definitely not even comparable to Cheesecake Factory or Martha's Country Bakery. The cheesecake was so dry.

So I feel I should mention that here. I had the \"Something Different.\" A brisket sandwich where the buns are made of potato pancakes! POTATO PANCAKES! And an au jus dip!!!! Massive pancakes that held together well under the circumstances. And when the sandwich finally started to fall apart - amazing applesauce (chunky) to accompany the pancake bits. I made the mistake of ordering fries on the side. Big mistake. Too much food. Just an amazing experience. One of the best meals of my life. I mean that.

I was looking to reuniting myself with their famous strawberry cheese cake .  I arrived at 07:20 hours and waited to be seated . There were 2 customers seated at the counter area and one waitress serving them . I waited a good 7 minutes to be seated, but no one approached me . The waitress at the counter was too busy talking to the kitchen staff . Finally the cashier walked over to me and seated me at the counter . The above waitress handed me the menu and looked very annoyed . I placed my ordered for the strawberry cheese.  When it arrived , I expected a glass of water, but she did not offer . The strawberry cheese cake was very good, but not for $9.00.  After I finished, I looked around for the waitress but she was no where to be found . I walked over to the cashier to pay my bill and suddenly the waitress walked over to collect my payment . You can see that she was waiting for a tip . I gladly paid my bill with zero tip.
