(Unfortunately I've gotten him the majority of times when ordering for delivery)\nI would rush down to the lobby, just bc I am a considerate individual, but only to stand in the lobby like an idiot waiting for my food. \n\nThe 2nd delivery dude is rude AF. \nCalls and tells me he's in the lobby. I tell him to give me a min. While I'm waiting for the elevator. (I work im a building w tons of employees with only 5 elevators) -  3 min passes by delivery dude calls me angry and asks if I'm gonna meet him for my food. I apologize to him for the wait.\nFinally make it to greet him. Only to see his ugly angry face. Who then just grunts and points at my order w my name.  I respond, yes that's mine. Thank you. - but no response from him. \n\nFor the rest of the evening I had his ugly face stuck in my mind. Forgot about it until now too.\n\nWhatevers, last time ordering from here.

It is the LAW to serve people a cup of water when requested; however, they refused to give me any water so I had to purchase a gingerale for $1.\nTheir price is pretty expensive too considering how easy a bowl of terriyaki sauce covered rice and meat is. Their store is extremely hot and I've been waiting quite a while now for my terriyaki orange chicken to be made, giving me time to write this review on how they aren't giving FREE WATER. Maybe this is common practice in Brooklyn (as I'm not a local I'm not sure), but this needs to change.\nAs far as orange chicken goes they are good.

Teriyaki Shack is a tiny place with one counter to sit at and a kitchen that takes up more than half the restaurant. It's not a good looking restaurant, but it doesn't try to be and by my taste, doesn't have to be. Service was fine. It's counter service and the staff were friendly enough. \n\nMy problem with the place is that the food was straight up bad and wasn't even that cheap. I got the sesame chicken entree which comes with a side; I chose lo mein noodles. The food came out in about 8 minutes or so. The chicken looked nothing like the image on the menu or like any chicken dish I've had before. Each piece was practically a ball. And in each ball was some dark meat chicken and some unidentifiable mush that I think must be filler made from who knows what. It was all flavorless except for the sauce on it, that tasted almost flavorless, but a little sweet. There were also vegetables in the container, but there were so few, they might as well not have even added them: literally one tiny piece of broccoli and a little lettuce. The lo mein was the best part and even that was subpar. I paid over $8 for this and I could only eat about half because I didn't want to have simply thrown away my money.\n\nIn conclusion, can't be the worst place a person could eat at, but buyer beware.", "author": "Todd P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-29", "description": "It's basically mall teriyaki but they are fast and delicious.

The only difference in my opinion is that Teriyaki Shack has better veggies.\n\nTeriyaki Shack is small and you can easily walk right by it without even knowing.. There isn't much seating inside. Maybe enough for five people on stools along the wall. I got the chicken and shrimp combo with brown rice. Had I known I was going to be charged 75cents for brown rice instead of white I would have just stuck with white. The combo came out to about $8.50 and it made for a solid meal.The fact that I was able to get two different meats over rice with veggies for $8 and change was awesome. \n\nTeriyaki Shack isn't anything special as far as the food goes but if you want a meal that will fill you up while eating on the cheap it's hard to beat this place.
