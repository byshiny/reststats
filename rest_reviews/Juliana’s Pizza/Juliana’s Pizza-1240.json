The pizza is delicious don't get me wrong but Di fara is still the best and it's not really even close. The Grimaldis style of pizza can be found in a lot of places in Brooklyn these days.  I would stop in when in the area but it doesn't make my heart race like Di fara does. I wouldn't drive all the way over here just to get it.

I would assume if you like Grimaldi's more than you're the kind of person who likes to kick puppies and punch babies. Grimaldi, the founder of Grimaldi's, is actually the chef at Juliana's. He started Grimaldi's, built it up, sold it and then decided he wanted to come back and the new owners said no so he started Juliana's next door.\n\nDefinitely delicious and definitely way better than Grimaldi's. And that's saying a lot because Grimaldi's is delicious as well.\n\nAlso, the pizza is good, but I think the cheesecake is great as well.", "author": "George R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-08", "description": "I did an experiment whereas I ordered a small pizza from Grimaldi's and one from Juliana's, the original maker of Grimaldi's pizza. Keep in mind I had no narrative bias, I really wanted to see which was the better pizza.\n\nAnd the difference was striking. Grimaldi's tasted like supermarket pizza and made me yearn for real NY pizza. I was laying blame on the style of the pizza. Then I went to Juliana's. Interestingly, small pizza with identical \"look\".But that's where the similarities ended. I was blown away by Juliana's Pizza. Every part of the pizza offered a complimenting flavor. The crust was toasty yet malleable whereas Grimaldi's was doughy and powdery. What's the point of the oven if that's how you serve it?\n\nJuliana's cheese was scrumptious and alive with flavors whereas Grimaldis tasted like mozzarella alone. The sauce at Gromaldi's was watered down, at Juliana's it had a rich flavor. Even the basil leaf on the Juliana pizza offered an interesting unique flavor while the Grimaldi's leaf might as well been an ornament. It tasted like  over cooked lettuce.I found a respect for the style of Pizza at Juliana's.", "author": "Hugo F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "Get thee to Brooklyn and eat this pizza!

Mind blown. We ordered two pizzas-- a Number one and then a traditional margharita with meatballs.  Both had thin, crisp crusts. The quality of the cheese and simple ingredients were truly gourmet. Almost an insult to call it pizza because it is so much better than any pizza I've ever eaten. Highly recommended, but get there early.

It's definitely not a place to have a romantice dinner. It's pretty busy, loud and crowded. We were very surprised about the size of the pizza, even the small ones are huge. And as I am a vegetarian we couldn't share, so we needed to order two, but couldn't manage to complete those. Based on the more canteen like atmosphere and the price (both pizzas were about 26-28$) I cannot give them the full rating.

We picked this one cause we wanted to be harrassed by Patsy Grilmaldi the man himself.\n\nOur pizzas were fresh off the newly stoked coals.  Crust was damn good.  Prices were on point.  Service was amazing.  Those guys were super cool.  Almost too nice.  Are we still in NYC?  \n\nFYI. Coals are stoked around 315pm for about 30 min.  Meaning no pizza is made during that time.

Friendly staff and our go to pizza spot for visiting friends- who want the NYC pizza experience. \n\nPlease note ( I know the line is long but): You have to eat the pizza while it is still hot, the taste experience is  significantly degraded when it gets cold. We tried takeout with friends and we all felt more than a little bit let down. It's like trying to take the river barge fireworks home, it just doesn't seem to work. That much goodness doesn't travel well and should be kept away from this cold, evil world until it is in the safety of your belly.\n\nSo if you try it in its glorious state of hot and fresh. You will make a return visit(s). \n Price is above what I would like, but right for the area and skill factor. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Stas L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-04", "description": "The pizza is very good. However, their customer service leaves a little to be desired if you are trying to order for take out. We have tried on numerous occasions to order from there. It seems as if they try to discourage people from ordering to go by stating that it will take an hour, or an hour and a half. The last straw was a little over a week ago. I called shortly after 8 pm to order a pizza. They told me it won't be ready until 10 pm, is that okay? I said that's okay, but thanks anyway and hung up the phone. Then my mother tried to order a pizza from them a couple of days later around 4 pm. The person answering the phone told her that they are not doing any take out orders for the rest of the day. She told them we've tried to order a couple of days ago, and that's bad business. I take it from the reviews listed on here that they are doing so well that they don't care about our business. Since it's such an issue for them, they should just state that they do not accept take out orders and it's dine in only, then the problem would be solved.", "author": "Lauren W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-31", "description": "Came on a beautiful Saturday afternoon to find only about 5 parties on line, about a 30 minute wait. The Grimaldi's line looked like it would take 2 hours.\n\nThe host was very friendly, and came out to keep us posted and find out how many people in each party.\n\nWe were seated, and after dealing with the really nice host, I was expecting some courteous service inside as well. This was definitely not the case. We were sitting for 20 minutes before a server came over and half-heartedly asked if we were ready. Thanks for not greeting us and asking if we wanted drinks, I guess someone was not trained correctly.\n\nWe ordered two pies, one margherita, and the other with pepperoni and meatballs. The plain was pretty tasteless, and our meat-za was a bit on the salty side, but we appreciated it more than the plain. The first bite was piping hot, crispy and delicious. But as you keep eating, you realize that it does not keep its texture and really comes short of expectations. The other slices got soggy before we got to go for seconds.\n\nOverall, if you want pizza, go to Di Fara's or Lucali's. Grimaldi's is good, but not worth the wait in Brooklyn. Juliana's is average, and if you're in the area and there's no line, then by all means, go for it.", "author": "Diane Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-05", "description": "Ok who visits New York and not eat Pizza? i don't care if you are in a strict diet, eating pizza in New York is a must! and having from one of the most famous places even BETTER!

The true Grimaldi's. The oven in the back has been there nearly a century. That kooky old guy who welcomed you in and is throwing pizza dough around the place is actually Patsy Grimaldi himself. Juliana was Patsy's mother; he sold Grimaldi's off many years ago, losing the right to use his own name on a pizzeria (he similarly lost the rights to Patsy's many years before in Harlem). These two restaurants have been bitter rivals ever since.\n\nYou'll need to bring a group to split a pie, but once you do it's pretty damn economical at $2.50 a slice. The long line and reputation obviously speaks to its quality, I expected to shell out a lot more. Consider that you'd pay almost double for the same thing by the slice at most places.  \n\nHIGHLY recommend the calzone too, it's incredibly filling and comes overloaded with a combo of extremely high quality cheeses.

If you are a cheese lover, get extra. The small pizza is 16\" which is big for a small (the menu didn't clarify how big the sizes were, large is 18\").\n\nI ordered a coke with my meal. I wished the server had told me that it would come in a tiny 8oz glass bottle (for $3). I prefer my coke with ice from a fountain so was disappointed. And 8oz is just a tease! Also, I wanted ranch or something creamy to dip my crust in. They didn't have it.\nOur service left much to be desired. We were the second table to arrive for lunch, so can't blame it on being busy. We never got water refilled or were asked if everything was ok. Unacceptable.\n\nI live in VA, so won't be back anyway.

First, the servers and wait staff were excellent and accommodating. The Caesar salad was excellent. Wonderfully fresh made croutons and delightful green olives. The pizza was \"ok\". Not really spectacular. We also had a pasta meat ball dish. The red sauce was excellent. The meat, though, was sub par and tasted a bit too much like pet food smells. That may be just me. But those at the table seemed to agree. I add quickly that it was , to be sure , not pet food.
