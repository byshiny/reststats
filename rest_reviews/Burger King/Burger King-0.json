First off it's really dirty. Seems like no one has cleaned the dining area in hours. There were napkins and wrappers all over the floor and drinks still on the tables. Behind the register wasn't a pretty site either. Fries on the floor and paper bags everywhere. No ketchup/dispenser available. The staff had a \"I don't give a F*CK attitude\".\n\nMy order was simple. Two whopper Jrs to go. It took 9 minutes. I was standing there waiting and told one of the cashiers that I was waiting. She says, \"I didn't take your order so I don't know what your waiting for...\" Seriously? Why do you work there!? I would avoid this place by all means.", "author": "Ron C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-15", "description": "The only reason this place is getting one star is because there's no option for no stars. The staff are ridiculously slow moving at a glacier pace with a line of customers. Every 2 mins the workers leave the line to do God knows what then come back and move at a turtles pace again. The manager sitting in the back on the computer completely oblivious to the fact that his customers are annoyed and his staff members absolutely suck!!!!", "author": "Marie P."}], "servesCuisine": "Fast Food", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Burger King", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "510 Fulton St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9iER8eHjfHv9TAfNuSRAOw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17189351404"}
