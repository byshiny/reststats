It satisfied my craving but I like my pizza a little more crispy than chewy. The garlic knots were very tiny but  tasty! \nOkay the only thing I didn't like was this place is a little disorganized. The two people who ordered  almost the same thing as me got their food first and I was waiting for quite a bit of time.

I'm not even a picky eater and this was hard to get down. The cheese tastes like plastic. There is no flavor. Very low quality ingredients. This is the first pizza I've ever hated.

Every since I was kid we went to my little pizzeria but once pronto came i had to try it and the taste of their dough made the switch easy. I love the bacon ranch pizza it's amazing. Soft doughy crust perfection. \nThe staff behind the counter are really helpful they're the reason I tried the bacon ranch (my new favorite). Love it!", "author": "yolanda c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-02", "description": "Delicious pizza, and super fast service. The pizza crust is crunchy and airy, and they nailed the cheese blend. Had the cheese pizza (excellent), Grandma's pizza (delicious), and loaded veggie pizza (delightful). They also accommodated our special request for plain buttered spaghetti for the kids, and gave us bread and butter to go with it. \n\nNote: we ate at the place, not delivery, so the pizza was fresh off the tray. They have a few tables way in back. It was perfect for a fast lunch on the way to Governor's Island.", "author": "Mark B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-04", "description": "Literally the best place in nyc!

I've managed to get the best quality pizza and wings on those nights (vs. others).\n\nMy go-to fave is the Sicilian with pepperoni. Oh-so-good.\n\nThe wings though. What happened?! The first time I ordered them, the wings were un-bbq-ed, super crispy and the buffalo sauce came on the side. I was in heaven. For some reason, they stopped doing that. Please, please bring it back.\n\nOh and the mini garlic knots are puffy bites of perfection.", "author": "Shu Jin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-14", "description": "One of the best classic slice pizza I had in Manhattan.

Pronto. No seriously, I actually thought that word. Lo and behold, Pronto Pizza was right in front of me. It was my density.*\n\nThe place was actually pretty packed for 3 pm on a weekday, which always bodes well for the food (high turnover = fresh pies). I'm a sucker for BBQ chicken in all its forms, so after waiting my turn (the service was not as pronto as one would hope), I asked the guy to throw a slice in the oven.**\n\nIt popped out a few minutes later, and I was pleasantly surprised. The BBQ chicken was fresh and tender (although the crust was a little too far on the crunchy side of crisp), and a drizzle of ranch dressing never hurt anyone. At $3.75, it was a solid lunch, and it hit the spot. I'd do it again. \n____________\n\n*Hello, McFly.\n**Pizza purists, don't judge me.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-21", "description": "I have never been so grossed out. I ordered Buffalo wings and fries from this place because I've had good experiences with their Staten Island location. Apparently Brooklyn isn't the same. The wings I had ordered look as if they had been fried for 10 hours straight and taste as if they were fried for 20. The barely there sauce is completely oily, looks and tastes unappetizing. I called the place to complain and instead got yelled at by some rude man who told me I was \"the only person to ever complain about their wings. In 7 years of business I never get no complain\" proceeded to yell at me before hanging up on me. Completely rude and unprofessional. I will DEFINITELY not be returning and honestly I should probably call the health department to inspect the place.", "author": "Lena V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-12-29", "description": "Lame pizza in a neighborhood full of great places.

Nothing spectacular.  Even bland most likely due to the lack of flavor from the whole wheat flour used.  (Granted, I am not used to eating whole wheat anything.)
