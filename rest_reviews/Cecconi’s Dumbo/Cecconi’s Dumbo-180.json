Beautiful space, great views if you're sitting outside. Service was solid. The food however was below average. Our simple dish of eggs were both extremely overcooked. Meatball app was average w a very sweet sauce. We simply could have done better by going to westville around the corner or walking to Jack The Horse in Brooklyn Heights. \n\nMaybe good for a cocktail to appreciate the space, but I call tourist trap.", "author": "David A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-06", "description": "The only reason to eat here is for the outside tables to people watch and enjoy the views of the river and bridges. The food is fine but nothing exciting. The octopus appetizer was the best thing out of 6 dishes we ordered. The host at the door (guy with a goatee) was pretty rude and snobbish for no reason. Our party was complete 15 min after our reserved time and when we asked to be seated, we got unnecessary attitude that annoyed all of us. No hospitality felt while checking in. However, the wait staff was more than friendly after we sat down so that made up for the poor experience in the beginning. Also, don't bother with the vegan chocolate cake...not good.", "author": "Sue Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-13", "description": "After a visit to the Brooklyn Historical Society museum in DUMBO, a friend and I stopped into Cecconi's for a drink and some small bites. We were in between the lunch and dinner meals, so they were only seating people in the bar, which worked perfectly for us. It would have been nice to eat on the outdoor patio, but the bar was quite lovely.\n\nThe vibe in the bar is just pure luxury and glamour. It is decorated with plush turquoise chairs, big exotic plants, and beautiful chandeliers. The bartenders wear crisp white jackets. And the old warehouse structure adds a little bit of a speakeasy feel to the place. \n\nWe had some happy hour cocktails with very reasonable prices. And we also tried the Fried Calamari and Buffalo Mozzarella Pizza. Everything was delicious And the service was actually quite good!

Feel like this is a hidden gem inside the market, the view is beautiful and food was delicious.

Staff super friendly and a killer view. I had the avocado  toast with the egg florentine on spinach. Just pretty awesome. The runny egg on the spinach is perfect. The avocado  thick rich and well mixed with things. \nIt only lasted a bit long before it came. Also the coffee and deserts were timed to far from each other timewise.\nGuys dont u fricking get it that i want my icecream with a sip of coffee damnit! Whats the point of bringing that coffee after all is done... \nAlso they let people wait and make it difficult to reserve. Which doesnt make sense cuz there was this awesome table empty and empty.... i know its new york.

The food is good, the atmosphere is spectacular, and the view is amazing.\n\nThe lobster spaghetti is my absolute favorite as is their wine collection. Didn't love the lettuce bib salad.\n\nIf you check in on Yelp you get a free mini pizza, which is enough for two people in my opinion.\n\nThis is the place to be in dumbo.\n\nBoris is THe BeST bartender.", "author": "Grace K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-24", "description": "I had a reservation and there was barely a 10 minute wait for an outside table.  The view was fantastic. We went there towards the end of brunch around 4pm on a Sunday right after walking the Brooklyn Bridge. The food was pretty good we shared the bresaola, burrata \u0026 wild mushroom pizza,  it was good but the crust was a little burnt on one side. The burrata was very nice on the pizza. We also shared the eggplant parmigiana, it was a nice piece layered with thick pieces of breaded and fried eggplant and mozzarella with a nice thick tomato sauce. Overall it tasted nice but the eggplant was a little chewy and rubbery and had more seeds than I like. I had a few cocktails and they were ok. Overall I'm pretty happy with my experience but I will probably only go back with out of town friends who visit me in Brooklyn. It was a little more pricey than my usual brunch spot but it was worth it just for the experience.", "author": "Bklynzizi P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-29", "description": "A couple of friends and I wanted to come here on a Thursday afterwork. I called and they said they had no reservations available but tables around the bar didn't require that. Ok. We arrived around 6 pm. We were able to get a table for 3. The venue has a great ambiance. The original arches from the warehouses with chandeliers. I would say It's a great date spot. We arrived on time for happy hour. There's only three drinks for happy\nHour and three price range appetizers $4,7,9!) we ordered the pizza, meatballs and calamari. The food here is not traditional Italian. The calamari had a kick (spicy) which we liked. The meatballs were small and had like a lemon zest after taste? My friend liked them I've had better meatballs. The pizza was ok for what it was. For dinner I got the rigatoni bolognese and my friend ordered the agnolotti with truffle. The serving size are not large. They are the serving size we are suppose to eat lol so if u have a big appetite, make sure u get apps\nAlong with your entrees. Both dishes were good but the agnolotti with truffle was amazingly tasty and I would order that next time. \nThe specialty drink at happy hour that I got\nWas the mixed berry americano. It wasn't really for me. It was refreshing but had like a spicy mustard after taste. After that I just stuck to Sauvignon blanc lol \nWhile we were dressed for the place there were some ppl seated near us very casually dressed. Bc it's a touristy area it will be mixed. But the view of the manhattan bridge and decor as a New Yorker, I couldn't imagine rolling up in there with shorts and tee.

We don't usually eat Italian because we cook Italian, but we really wanted to eat near the Brooklyn Bridge. We were not disappointed, the food was excellent.  It was s little pricey for the portion size, but we are talking New York prices.

Cecconi's is one of the new tenants and is fitting right in with the high-rent neighborhood.\n\nThe decor here, as I would describe it, 1960's Miami chique - with big ol' leafy plants; deep, blue velvet chairs and benches; checked floors and chandeliered ceilings; and the staff in starched shirts and jackets.  Don't forget the waterfront view. Very impressive, if you're looking to impress.  \n\nThe food here is a bit more humble.  But only a bit.  While it's pizza and eggplant parm, it's elevated yet familiar; rich yet approachable.  I recommend the ceviches which are made tableside.  The prices are a bit surprising, but think of the ambiance and the views!

Twice I sat at the bar and ate, and this past Monday I had made a reservations to take some very discerning foodie friends who were visiting from out of town. Our reservations was for 6:15 and we had the option to wait for a table on the terrace, but due to the mugginess, we preferred to be seated in the main dining room. That being said, our table still had an impressive view of the Brooklyn Bridge and the East River. \n\nOur server Jennifer was professional, efficient, knowledge and warm. We were also visited by a couple of the managers Nikki and Joy, who stopped by to see how we were enjoying everything. \n\nAs with both West Hollywood and London, the food was amazing. Some of the dishes I have tried and loved since Cecconi's Dumbo opened last month are as follows: the Calamari, Salmon, Roast Potatoes,Tuna Tartare, Lobster Spaghetti, Buffalo Mozzarella Pizza, Whipped Ricotta with Truffle Honey, Gianduja Profiteroles, Tiramisu. All of it full of flavor, note* I highly recommend trying the Whipped Ricotta, so creamy, a little sweet, a little salty. SO tasty! Oh, and the olive oil. I've never had better!  \n\nAnd for drinks I have enjoyed a classic New York Sour, and lots of wine (Cheers to the wine manager for the wine selection; a nice variety and at reasonable prices). I'm a huge fan of the Nero d'Avola...and I enjoyed a very strong Matcha Latte today, it was served with some pistachio biscotti which hit the spot, and gave me a little jolt to boot!\n\nI was pleased to learn about their happy hour which is from 4-7 from Tuesday to Friday. Not too shabby that one can enjoy a $7 glass of wine at the bar and enjoy the view and appreciate the design aesthetic of Cecconi's! \n\nI have already booked another reservation for August for a special occasion. That's my one bit of advice, if I should have any.
