You will always get friendly service and a pretty good meal.  The decor and mood is just right for hanging out with friends or family because I feel just as comfortable swimming in margaritas as I do drinking water and eating a small appetizer.  The noise level is just right where you can hear your friends speak, but you don't feel like you are part of every other conversation in the building.  \n\nBack to the food, we've had probably almost everything on the menu.

(I mean, besides Woody Guthrie.)\n:)\n\nThey make a damn fine margarita on the rocks (with salt please), which really hit the spot after a long workday. I could, and have, stuffed myself on the complimentary chips and salsa. The guacamole is up to lisa standards (and I have high ones. Okay, fine, I'm a snob), and as I have mentioned in my other Lobo review, the fried okra is also a must. I usually get the veggie tacos and can never finish all three which are stuffed with portabello mushrooms, onions and peppers. Everything the dude has tried when we've gone here has resulted in his continued membership in the Clean Plate Club. So, I guess it's good. \n\nThey are cash only and there's an ATM upstairs.

I don't get it. \n\nI've had everything from the catfish sandwich to the enchiladas to the salsa and queso - and it is, delicious. It's the best tex-mex food you can get in NYC, to my knowledge...and I track down tex-mex places like they're giving out free gold bars. \n\nAnyway, I don't live in the neighborhood anymore, so I don't feel too bad giving up the insiders secret: sit at the bar, fool! The bartenders are awesome, they're the ones controlling the music (usually), and you get WAY better service through them than through the waitstaff.

Lobo is probably the best we're going to do.  The salsa is spicy, although it is way too much like a pasta sauce with chiles, and our enchiladas verdes were not altogether appalling (though the verdes part of it is a pale shadow of what one would get in Texas; for some reason the tomatillo sauce was more sweet than sharp, which is a real puzzle).  Still, they have Lone Star, and it's not too expensive.  Worth a visit to fulfill your Tex-Mex craving.  \n\nAlso, I like the room.

I visited on a Friday during Lent, so I ended up doing the veggie soft tacos. Well, those were quite the disappointment. They just tasted like saut\u00e9ed vegetables in oil, with no seasoning whatsoever. The sides were just okay. Sadly, I think the best part of the meal was the chips and salsa.\n\nMaybe I should just order a meat dish next time?

I got mine with deep fried pickles and cole slaw because I wanted to be sure I ate nothing with actual nutritional value, and went with the traditional margarita.  \n\nThe margarita was strong and delicious, and the chips and salsa to start were completely addictive.  But ohh my steak.  Why you do this to me??  I told our perky waitress that I wanted it medium, not that I wanted it with half-cooked batter falling off it.  Aside from my steak's nip-slip batter moment, it was pretty delish, but my main gripe is the size.  If I had known I would be getting 7oz of skirt steak for $16, I would have walked my ass over to Popeye's to get a satisfying chicken dinner for 8 bucks.  Alright, this is the broke-ass student in me talking, but seriously I was saddened.  On a brighter note, the fried pickles were great and the cole slaw, while a tad mayonnaise-y, was cold, crisp and delicious.  \n\nIf I ever have money again, I may come back and try a different Tex-Mex favorite, but I don't know if I can handle getting hurt like that again...*sniff.*", "author": "Maeve C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-17", "description": "I've eaten at this Lobo before, as well as the establishment in Park Slope, and I am always underwhelmed. I think they use too many onions and the prices are too high for what you get, but on a cold winters night I didn't feel like wandering around Cobble Hill when all we wanted was a nice strong drink and some hearty Mexican fare. Sadly, we did not receive either. \n\nThe food came out fast, like super fast, like so fast it makes you worry that it's been sitting under a hot light for a while. The burrito was completely lackluster, it had zero flavor. The refried beans, rice, and four cubes of tomato were mushy and tasteless. The chicken was fine, but I swear the sparse sprinkles of cheese were yellow American cheese. My companion, whose pork tacos were equally boring yet edible, insisted that it wasn't American but just really cheap cheddar. The drinks, at $8 each, came in small, thick tumblers and were insanely sour. At the bottom of each floated a huge chunk of lemon; lemon? In a Marg? \n\nFood and drinks aside, the ambiance was terrible. There were barely any other patrons upstairs with us late on Saturday and the place was blasting punk music as loud as can be. Now, I'm not an old curmudgeon, I appreciate all genres of music, but not when I'm eating. I'm pretty sure screaming is bad for digestion. When they finally turned it off, the other diners and I made eye contact and sighed in relief.

I always hate when they make you think there is so much more than there really is.\n\nHUGE bonus points for having Dos XX Amber on tap... huge enough to bump Lobo up to 4 stars!\n\nThere are TVs playing sports games and the service is good too, so I can see this being a nice place for a mixed group of friends to come.", "author": "Kirsten S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-27", "description": "My fianc\u00e9 \u0026 I were walking around Cobble Hill today around lunchtime. I'd had positive experiences at Lobo in Park Slope, so I thought that we'd stop into the Court Street location for lunch. We walked in - crowded bar, few people at tables, busy bartender, no wait staff. The bartender was busy - totally get it. After not being acknowledged when we walked in, I asked if we could sit anywhere \u0026 was gruffly answered with \"sit there\" as she guided her chin at a table. Strike one. No \"hey there, feel free to sit anywhere, be with you in a minute\" kind of greeting. Busy doesn't give anyone a license to be rude. Anyway, we sat, were given menus, again, not even a hello. My fianc\u00e9 went upstairs to use the restroom, so I figured I'd order guacamole \u0026 chips while waiting for him to return. The bartender bussed a table \u0026 went back to the bar without greeting me, not even saying \"I'll be right back\" - nothing. Then, the final straw - she disappeared from the floor for a good 10 minutes! So, we're not even going to be greeted or acknowledged and we're going to pay upwards of $60-$75 for the privilege? No thanks! We walked out \u0026 ended up going to Jolie on Smith Street. Not only did we had an awesome meal, but we were treated kindly \u0026 given excellent service. Sorry, Lobo.
