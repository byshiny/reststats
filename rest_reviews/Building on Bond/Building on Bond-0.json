I had the cauliflower and poblano soup, burger with hand-cut fries. Soup was creamy and full of flavor. The burger was moist/juicy and cooked perfectly. \n\nWe also shared Japanese chicken wings and Brussels sprouts. The chicken wings were big and extra crispy. Sauce was spot on too. The sprouts were roasted to perfection and had the right amount of seasoning Parmesan cheese. Tasted great.\n\nService was on point too. Convenient location, great food, chill vibes inside.

Though its not, food is way average and over priced. \n\nWe didn't care for the mac and cheese with bacon. The bacon wasn't crispy and for some reason the whole dish had some sort of sterile or soapy flavor. Like they just washed the skillet with soap and water and poured the mac and cheese in. \n\nWe also ordered the chicken, which was overcooked and chewy. The mash potatoes were good though. We ordered a side of fries, fries were average and nothing to rave about.\n\nI did like the atmosphere. Very Brooklyn chill, and that made for a nice double date. \n\nNothing great about the service. We had to ask twice for a side of mayo for the fries. And thought the waitress was rude in the way she asked for my drivers liscence.\n\nPretty cool bar they own next door though. Good cocktails and they play some interesting music on Saturday night. Crowded and small though.

As other reviewers have noted, I also had an strange experience last weekend at the \"shrieking shack\". A loud yelp was cried out by what I assume to be the bartender. At first my heart skipped a beat thinking a horrific burn had occurred but I was disappointed to learn it was just because tensions couldn't be contained between the waiters in the room.\n\nAs far as the food goes, I had my usual egg sandwich with a side of sausage. Now one would think this would a be simple request in the culinary world, but apparently it was too much to handle on this particularly dreary day. While the eggs were perhaps pedestrian as best, the sausage left a taste in my mouth that one could only describe as dry cardboard. Completely overcooked, under-flavored, and uninspired. \n\nLook, like the rest of us, I just want to see this local joint survive and thrive, but instead I'm left wondering if we owe it to our neighborhood to put this old horse out to pasture.", "author": "Christopher M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-06-01", "description": "Went here on mother's day for with my fiance's family. We were a bit early for our reservation so we hung around the front and were able to get a couple of drinks .. I got a chai latte which was very good and in a large bowl style cup. They had the music blasting in this front part of the restaurant, luckily when we were seated we got tucked away into the cozy back room of the restaurant. We all ordered a drink and then entrees. The service was slow, but I can appreciate it was a busy day. However , we were disappointed because they seemed to have a smaller menu out for mother's day and it was missing a lot of things on the original menu which we looked up prior to choosing this restaurant. My future father in law and I both got the cheeseburger. Mine was just okay and his was served cold.

This past weekend however, I had the weirdest experience here. There was some sort of altercation between the two barista/bartender ladies behind the counter, which resulted in one of them letting loose a bloodcurdling screech. Everyone looked up from their meal to see what was going on. At first I thought one of them may have burned herself, but instead they both just looked pissed and were carrying on as normal. I overheard someone ask the waiter what had happened, and he said, \"We just got a rush of customers, so tensions are high.\"\n\nHm. Weird that this place can't handle a semi-busy brunch hour with any semblance of professionalism.  (The place wasn't even full.)\n\nOn top of that, the food has gone way downhill lately. My \"fried\" egg was so runny that not even the egg whites were cooked, and were a mucousy mess. My boyfriend ordered the blueberry pancakes (+$2 for blueberries) and they were just plain pancakes with about 5 blueberries dropped on top. The sausage was pink all the way through, so we didn't risk eating it.\n\nThere were tons of families and kids, which is nice! But it makes me think that this restaurant relies on a loyal \"locals\" crowd and has given up putting effort into its meals or service. I used to like this place-- really disappointing.", "author": "Maria L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-12", "description": "I was shopping in the area with a friend and we became desperate for a nice place to take a break with some wine and eats.

The restaurant is pretty large, it has 3 distinct sections. I was in a rush so I ordered the old bay fried chicken sandwich with a side salad. All and all the food came out quick and wasnt bad. The chicken sandwich was cooked well. I thought it would be saltier because of old bay. It could have actually used some salt. The salad was standard balsamic salad and a good sized portion.

But the service is meh. First of all they seem to have not enough waiters. We waited ten mins at the front door with no one to take us to our seats. After we placed the order we waited again for like half an hour for those two dishes only. The waiter said it's too busy but it's almost two on the Sunday afternoon and most people have left. (For such a small street corner storefront cafe it's just not reasonable to have so many seats but so few waiters, and the lady at the next table almost tripped and hit my back because there's not enough walking space). After we got our dishes we found there's a missing sausage and we were told they ran out of it only after we asked (but they refunded us in the end so that's alright).

Set on a quiet corner in Carroll Gardens. However the recent menu changes are awful. \n\nOne reason I kept coming here was their Brussels sprouts. Charred to perfection they also were infused with the flavor of jalape\u00f1o peppers and some kind of amazing sauce that all added up to the best Brussels sprouts I've had. \n\nWell I had to ask the waiter tonight what exactly was wrong with them. They seemed drier and less tasty than usual. I asked him what happened to the jalape\u00f1os, assuming they ran out. Then I found out the bad news that they changed the recipe. It tasted like the dried out bottom of the pan.\n\nThey still had some kick, and I still think they were cooked well, just dry.\n\nThe veggie burger and fries remained the same. But they changed the bun for the worse.
