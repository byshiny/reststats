However, we were freeezing while lining up outside of the restaurant.  The line was very very very long but it kind of went by fast even though my toes were frozen.  Come on a nice day when it isn't that cold because u will be waiting outside in line.  We ordered a small pizza which fed the three of us.  The pizza was okay...just your usual pizza nothing that fascinating.", "author": "jennie t."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-24", "description": "Long Lines and Cash Only. That's a sign of one of the top 10 pizza joints in NY.  I recommend adding capers and olives to your pie.   As good as Grimaldi is, Di fara's is still the best pizza in NY.

Shared the antipasto platter, a large pizza with garlic and basil (recommended by T), and a medium pizza with sausage and mushroom.\n\nThe antipasto came with 4 slices of mozzarella, 4 slices of salami, 4 large green olives, and some roasted sweet red bell peppers.  The platter was yummy, especially with the mozzarella and peppers heaped over the crunchy toasted bread served with it.\n\nThe garlic and basil pizza was pretty good, but either it was too garlicky or I felt the garlic was a little....rancid?? But the sauce was tasty, the cheese melted and gooey but not too thick, and tasty very thin crust.  The sausage and mushroom pizza came out watery (??) which proves to me (again) that the thinner the pizza crust, the better the pizza tastes with LESS toppings to weigh it down.  \n\nI also had a cannoli, which came with chocolate sprinkles and plenty of cream! Yummy!!\n\nWe waited about 40 minutes outside on a Sunday night, finally being seated around 8:45pm...and when we left, there was still people waiting to be seated at almost 10pm.  Pizza was good, but I've now had better.  But it's still a fun place to come check out!", "author": "Junkfoodie Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-18", "description": "The pizza's all right. Given that (a) this place is in New York, and (b) it bills itself as being some of the best pizza in an already pizzalicious town, I thought I'd be more impressed. I've had much better pizza at Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven.\n\nI ordered a plain cheese pie, which for me is the true test of how good a joint can cook a pizza. The sauce: great. The crust: just OK--good consistency, but not very tasty. The cheese: fine. The spices: fine. But it wasn't excellent. It didn't leave me drooling for more. What leaves me drooling for more (aside from the New Haven venues) is Ben's near the 4th St./Washington Square stop in Manhattan. Now THAT is killer pizza.\n\nI would go to Grimaldi's again. I just wouldn't rave about it.", "author": "Kathryn B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-01", "description": "Pretty disappointing and not worth the wait.  The other reviewers were right on when they said the pizza is soggy.  While ordering too many toppings may add to the sogginess, I think it is the watery tomato sauce that really did the pizza in.  If (when) you get stuck waiting for the one bathroom, keep an eye on the guys making the pizza because it explains why the toppings are clumped in a random pile.  The dough and crust was great, but unfortunately it was charred on most of the pizzas we saw.  This place was probably great once, but now it is just coasting on the name.", "author": "Chris B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-06", "description": "The pizza is truly some of the best ot there. I went on a cold and rainy Saturday afternoon about 2 hrs after opening and had to wait about 40 minutes. The wait was worth it, as the food was divine. Great atmosphere, hole in the wall location. I split the antipasto and a large Margherita. The antipasto is not very large, but is very good and features fresh ingredients. The pizza was excellent, oozing with quality ingredients, and the 1000 degree coal oven cooks the crust just right. The service is fine, I know people complain but i got my food very fast with a smile. 2 people, Antipasto, Large Pie, and Drinks came out to 35 with tip. Great food, and price.

BUT, why I really love this place is how you can make a fab afternoon of it, especially if you have someone in from out of town. \n\nSample amazing NYC day for you and a gal (or guy, slightly altered plan though) from out of town, or just needing a little staycation:\n-Go to Century 21 and stock up on lovely discounted couture lingerie.\n-Get out the camera and walk across the Brooklyn Bridge\n-Spend a few minutes walking in circles trying to find Grimaldi's\n-Get in the line and make a friend-asap\n-Offer to trade off waiting in line with this friends group, to which they will likely say \"Sure, we will hold your spot.\"\n-You and your pal ask the people in the front how long they have been waiting so you can gauge how much time you have to essentially let someone stand in line for you, while you find the nearest bar and get the afternoon party started (We went to the place right on the corner, which had really awesome infused martini special-wild blueberry gin? Hello.\n-Come and check in with your 'friends' after like 30 min, then spend another 10 finishing up your drink(s)\n-Get back in line, showering thanks on the poor saps that stood there for 45 min.\n-Get called it, sit down, immediately start flirting with the very funny waiters and pizza chefs (they should be called that-they rock)\n-Order a carafe of wine, and a small pizza if you are 2 ladies sharing (its HUGE). I had mushrooms and anchovies on my half and had one piece left.\n-Save some room for the dessert-the tarfuto, tartuto sp? is this delish icecream roll with chocolate and vanilla covered in a dark chocolate shell with a little touch of raspberry jam, and the canoli was great too.\n-Have cash, dont take cc's, and don't take pics of the chefs. While the waiters hijacked our camera and took numerous pics of themselves, the chefs don't dig it. \n-If you can, walk back over the bridge. If not, the train is a few blocks away.\n=All the makings of a great day", "author": "Meredith M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-08", "description": "You shouldn't pass up the opportunity to eat at Grimaldi's!
