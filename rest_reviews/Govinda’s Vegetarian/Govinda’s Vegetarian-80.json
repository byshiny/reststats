Like of all the places we could go to eat, I'm walking him down stairs to what looks and feels like a soup kitchen for those without a place to call home.\n\nOf course everyone there is super pleasant. I mean like, when we asked if was cash only, we were told \"it is, but if you don't have it, you can pay us some other day.\" The two of us shared a $10 platter which pretty much got us everything that was left on the buffet (getting there later in the day means that some items are gone already!) and then ordered some other misc stuff too. Seating is family style at round banquet tables, so buddy up with anybody among the mix of people and families that only a vegetarian lunch in the basement of a hindu temple would be able to bring together.", "author": "Allison K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-27", "description": "Great vegetarian cuisine for cheap.

But I am sure glad I had the chance to today!    Lunch is served cafeteria style and you have the option of tasting the whole menu or picking and choosing the items you want.  You pay based on how many items you select.  Everything was delicious and the portions are very generous.  Most of the items were vegan and the staff is very friendly so you can ask any questions re: dietary restrictions or anything else.

I enjoy diversifying my plate and seeing what different cultures concoct to satisfy that same feeling located in the abdomen all around the world. I heard about Govinda's and decided to check it out. \n\nI must say the photos didn't do this place justice. I first entered the Hare Krishna temple (where Govinda's is located) and was greeted by a \"Namaste\" from a kind woman. Before I could even smile at the authenticity of her kindness, they asked if I were there for lunch and politely pointed towards the staircase leading to the basement. I thanked them and went on my way. \n\nAs I conquered the steps, I glided into the destination and behold - Indian music (for lack of a better term) hummed in the background, large round tables littered the area, and a small kitchen was set up on the far right side. I inhaled and immediately knew I was getting my money's worth. \n\nOne dish I recommend getting is this hot salad made with cauliflower, green beans, kale, potatoes, and more, all saut\u00e9ed with spices, including tumeric. They even serve free mango lemonade (with no added sugar) along with your dish. \n\nThis is a great place to go for a date, lunch on the go, or just to relax from the heat. It's a wonderful experience for anyone wishing to escape the bustling streets of New York and enjoy some vegan/vegetarian grub. Go there often enough and you might catch me chowing down too.", "author": "Garrett K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-07", "description": "Oh.. My... Gosh. Best $10 lunch option in the area. SO GOOD. Seriously i'm hooked. The bread was fresh baked, light n fluffy.

Everything is served cafeteria style by a sweet, smiley lady.\n\nEntrees range from nut \"meat\" loaf, chana masala, quinoa salad, lentil daal, vegan eggplant parmesan, curried kale, etc.  The slices of raisin bread they serve are free and go great with the daal.  They also have free mango lemonade for all customers, but it usually runs out by around 3pm.  The lunch buffet is open until 3:30pm on weekdays only.\n\nGovinda's makes food that my grandma would make if she were Indian.  It tastes so homemade, unique, and infused with thought, love, and care. I would love to meet the head chef and thank him for creating such unique Indian dishes that are delicious and always perfectly spiced.\n\nThank you, Govinda's, for giving me a lunch option other than Two Bros or Subway!\n\n*In Manhattan, that title goes to the NY Dosa cart near NYU.

The food was good, and you really can't beat the price! Remember, this is not fine dining and there is no table service, but it is fairly nice for what it is (a basement cafeteria).\n\nI recommend going with someone who you can share with. For 10 bucks you can get some of everything, but it is far too much food for one person to eat.

The menu changes daily, but you can get deliciously full for $6-8, $10 if you want lunch and a snack later. \n\nI had it down to the eggplant parm and a slice of cheesecake. (Really, I could get a whole tray of that eggplant parm.) The service can be slow because it's usually just one person and the serving sizes vary (I WANT CORNERS ALL THE CORNERS) but it's a low-key kind of place, with communal tables and a bus-your-trays policy.
