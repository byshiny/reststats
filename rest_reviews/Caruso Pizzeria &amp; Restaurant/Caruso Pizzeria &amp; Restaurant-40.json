Is this my all time favorite, if I could have any pizza in the world before I die, pizza spot...no. \n\nBUT, it's good and they have a thick crust option with bacon which is just heaven when I'm starving and don't want to cook, to be honest! And what's better, in my opinion, is the guys that work here are great! They are always super friendly and quick and when I see them outside the shop around the neighborhood they couldn't be any nicer. So yes, part of me just wants to give them business because they remember customers and take the time to say hi, not just \"what'll it be\". \n\nSo that wins out for me!!", "author": "London J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-31", "description": "Before an Oscars party at a friend's house around the corner, I came in here and got a square margherita slice AND something else with a cream sauce base. It wasn't crowded, so I was annoyed at how long it took to reheat the stuff, and almost wanted to tell them to just give them to me at room temperature. There was nowhere really to wait, because the area by the counter was soon occupied by a woman with a wretched kid saying in Spanish, \"Da me.......\" Give me. Give me. I shuddered. I have nothing against the Spanish language or Spanish speakers, but there was something so horrible about just waiting and listening to the coarseness of her order while her brat twisted and whined at her side, obviously more desirous of a nutritious piece of fruit or a sandwich packed with fresh greens.\n\nI should speak for myself, though - both pieces of pizza had a sort of Pizza Huttish quality; crispy and oil-saturated at the same time. But actually, Pizza Hut is tastier. It was something my body didn't need anyway.\n\nOn my way out the door, because I couldn't stand the empty, depressing, narrow sitting area strewn with litter, a few skater inspired punks with graphic hoodies but no skateboards accosted me.\n\n\"Yo, yo, how much was that slice?\" \n\n\"Three fifty,\" I mumbled, as oily crumbs sprayed out from my mouth.\n\n\"What?! THREE fifty? FUUUCK. HELL no,\" they spat, and stalked off into the darkness. \n\nI was still eating the slices as I rang my friend's doorbell. She saw me on the video and said, \"How's the pizza, Jia???\" I didn't answer, but only gave puppy eyes to the monitor, then heard the buzzer.", "author": "Jia J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-06-21", "description": "Called to order a pizza and more than an hour later - no pizza.

Good slice. Over priced 20 ounce soda. The variety available when entering is impressive.

And the garlic knots are...questionable. Like little buttery rocks. And the fries (yes, we ordered fries) are oversalted and totally forgettable.\n\nBut the stuffed pizza is awesome. Tasty and filling and a ton of food for not much money. Even my pizza snob friend was impressed, which pretty much never happens.\n\nDelivery is fast and the guys are really friendly. It's not the be-all, end-all of pizza but it's really satisfying when you're really hungry.", "author": "Abigail S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-01-07", "description": "One of the worst pies I've ever had. I picked it up, shelled out $13, and gave the rest to my guy's roommates. Doughy, lumpy crust, poor cheese distribution, and the sauce lacked any tang.  Anyway, we've since broken up. Bad pizza has a way of souring a budding romance. \n\nOn a side note, my walk down Smith was uneventful. My walk back up with pizza in hand was replete with whistles and cat calls.

My ideal cheap, greasy, fat-laden lunch would be a slice of white and two pepperoni knots. Mm. \n\nThe counterstaff kind of rules too; whenever I see any of them on the street they wave and nod. Even when I went through my three month stint of, \"OMG eating pizza twice a week is giving me zits\" and I avoided them, they'd still say hi to me, should I pass them on my way to Starbucks or Rite Aid. \n\nPS I'm over the zit thing.\n\nPPS OMG eating pizza twice a week is gonna make me fat.", "author": "Danielle G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-09", "description": "Everyone complains about the pizza not being good. It's Pizza! When has pizza ever floored you? This pizza isn't bad. The thing that keeps me coming back is the consistency of it. I've been to a lot of different places and the pizza here is better than others and the taste is always the same.\n\nI would say the only downfall to this place is it doesn't stay open late enough on the weekends.

Not my favorite, but a solid local joint in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. They don't seem to be very responsive to the customers and their food is not as good as others have mentioned.

There's nothing remarkable about the pizza here but their square slices - which are more reminiscent of the slices in Italy than NYC pizza - are really pretty good.  Not talking about the \"Sicilian\" slices - but the thinner square slices, some of which have good toppings.  There are some good full pie places in the neighborhood now that are a little more gourmet and generally pretty good, but for a few slices, I might prefer this place to nearby Pronto and I definitely prefer it over My Little.", "author": "David W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-12-04", "description": "Average pizza.

How hard is it to mess up a cheese slice? I don't know, it's dough, sauce and mozarella, but Carusos is horrible. $2.5 for a slice of cheese and while the sesame seeds are a nice touch the pizza tastes like gasoline. I don't know about you but I am not a fan of the flavor. Instead of this place, go one block east and south to Mario's, it's the best $1 slice I've had.
