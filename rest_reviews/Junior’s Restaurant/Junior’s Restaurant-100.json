I prefer the plain, but the strawberry is wonderful, and pineapple so so. They have a devils food cheesecake that is completely to die for if chocolate is your thing. \n\nThe staff is always happy and friendly and helpful.

Cheesecakes everywhere! From left to right and back, it is as if you were having a buffet surround by cheesecakes. Right side filled with whole pie with each level divided into different size and price inside the glass refrigerator. While on the left side, the glass refrigerator filled with single slide package in plastic boxes. It is like a cheesecake heaven. If you wanted try something famous here in NYC then Junior's cheesecake is definitely a stop before going back. One located in Manhattan, Time Square(New) and another one at Brooklyn, Fort Greene. \n\nThis is definitely a tourist trap, nothing else is good except for their cheesecake. The food was decent compare to other America restaurants so do not come here for the food. The services here was also not so great. Overall, do not waste your money here and go somewhere else for a better meal. \n\n If you are here, then definitely get a slice or the whole cheesecake to share. Their single slice is pretty big but they are not cheap either. A plain cheesecake costs around $8 with taxes and a strawberry cheesecake will be around $9 and that is definitely not a good price. The cheesecake had a good flavor and texture which is different from others. I believed for the price, you can get a better cheesecake but this is NYC so everything here is extra expensive for no reason.", "author": "Zhang C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-25", "description": "I've been eating here for years. It's always a great experience. I love their food, drinks and of course the cheesecake. I love the milkshake with the slice of cheesecake on it. It's a lot but I had to conquer it. Junior's is a big deal in Brooklyn and I will always stop in for some good food. Stopped in on the way to a Brooklyn Nets game. It was easier to park Downtown Brooklyn then catch the subway to Barclay. I ate good so I didn't have to worry about food or drinks at the game. There are plenty of shops in the area so it's a great place to spend the day. The menu has something for everyone. I love the corned beef sliders. My favorite cheesecake is the apple crumb and one of these days I'll order a cheesecake and have it shipped.

My parents would come here all the time for celebrations. Over the Summer I went here about three times and I always order the barbecue half spring chicken with potato salad mac, and cheese, garden salad and extra corn bread. Well my last time here the food was not so good. The chicken was reheated with stale barbecue sauce that taste like old ketchup. The potato salad had undercooked potatoes and my corn bread was cold and hard. I am not sure if there was a different cook that day or an off day or that Junior's just fell off completely.

She was working around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago.  She has long black hair, medium build.   My son was in short, being a pill and I was very upset.  I had to run home (down the block) to get something he forgot and I was really flustered.  When we left, my son accidentally left 40 dollars and a metrocard on the table.   I ran back to Junior's.   I felt like such a mess.  When I walked in this waitress opened her arms, gave me the money and the metrocard and she said \"it's going to be ok\".   Can I just tell you how much I needed that?  She could have judged me but instead she knew I was stressed and that I needed some warmth and understanding.   I will never forget her.  My son was also moved by this.  The food was great, but she is an angel.  Thank you so much!!!", "author": "Brenda L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-22", "description": "Ah, Juniors. I have childhood memories of family outings to this place where... each time my father would flip his shit over a non-issue, embarrass the family and ruin the evening... Anyway:\n\nJUNIORS!

I wouldn't call it GREAT, but I wouldn't call it the BAD.

If you can, pick up your cheesecake, but don't bother trying to get one delivered. Nobody seems to know how to process an order.\n We got a gift certificate from a friend for a cheesecake. First we tried to order online, then that didn't work, so we called. The phone person didn't know, so transferred us to a person who said we couldn't do certificates online, you had to mail it in. So we mail it in and no response -- call again, since it's been 4 weeks. We get passed around to 4 different people none of whom said the same thing but at least one said you had to do it online.  One said we called the wrong number -- shame on us, we called the number on their form.

Diddy made the band walk to in Brooklyn to bring him back some cheesecake from. It was a block away from our hotel and when we walked in, immediately you're overtaken by the different flavors of cheesecake displayed in the entrance. There's so many different flavors to choose from. We went 2 nights in a row because on our first night, the food was just so good. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of vegetarian options on the menu nor a lot of seafood. I opt'd for the Tuna Melt which came on a large english muffin with 2 slices of cheese on top, sided with some fries, slaw, and pickles. The tuna melt wasn't the best. I ended up not finishing it because it just wasn't as flavorful as it looked. The slaw, very dry. This is far from southern cole slaw that I am use to. The service is good and quick but most of their waitors seemed to be foreign so at times it was a little hard to understand them. I found that weird only because Juniors' is an American food establishment. Would I go back again.

She helped me decide between the pastrami and burger; very good at making sure we (and from what I observed, all her customers) were good; and she was also the right amount of cheerful, but not fake about it.\n\nShout out to other servers who were dealing with what seemed like a very obnoxious, difficult customer who was seated next to us.

I had a slice of the apple crumb cheesecake, which had a later of cinnamon apples under their cheesecake along with streusel crumbs layered on top. It's a rich cheesecake, without being overwhelming or decadent. My favorite is probably still the plan with pineapple, but this one is still really great.\n\nFor lunch, I had a roast beef and turkey combination sandwich on an onion roll. I got two kind of medium sized sandwiches, larger than a slider, but a little smaller than a typical round kaiser roll. The meats were flavorful and moist, and the Swiss cheese was melted on top. I added a little of their deli mustard as well and it was a very enjoyable lunch. The fries were ok, nothing overly special though. Not really worth the extra $2. It's also very cool that they serve free vinegar slaw, sour pickles and beets to your table as well.\n\nPrice was about $70 for two people (two sandwiches, two soft drinks, two desserts, one coffee).
