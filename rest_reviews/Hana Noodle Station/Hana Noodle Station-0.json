The wait was almost nonexistent on a Saturday night, and I was excited to try something new - the Shanghai Cold Noodles with Shredded Chicken.\n\nI was hoping for a delicious cold noodle, and while these noodles were chewy and fresh, they just didn't stand out in any way to me. The noodles themselves didn't have any real flavour except salty, and while the chili sauce helped a bit, the dish was very flat and 2-Dimensional. The chicken was fine, a bit dry, obviously, since it was shredded white meat, but the noodles and cucumber itself I could not finish for the heavy salty soy sauce that it was drenched in. I really wanted to like Hana Noodle Station, but I am wary of trying anything else after the bad taste of the Shanghai Cold noodle in my mouth.", "author": "Tony L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-08", "description": "Summary: microwaved food that's overpriced and light on flavor. \n\n1) The cashier prepared my Zhajiang Noodles.

It is extremely overpriced for what you get. I had the peanut noodles with pineapple. Let me tell you, the entire thing came with three small cubes of canned pineapple. The peanut sauce for the noodles had no flavor whatsoever. It left me feeling nauseated and I could not even finish the noodles. I also got the pan fried dumplings. It looks like they only fry one side of the dumplings on the pan. Also after eating these dumplings, I was completely indigested. I did not enjoy the food here at all.

I liked the portion - it was just right for the appetite I had.\n\nThere were lots of places to sit, so I took a break here and had a nice meal.

It's one of my favorites for a quick lunch break when I'm working in Brooklyn and the weather is cold!  I've tried all of the noodle soups (stick to the traditional beef ones), the dumplings, and the minced pork noodle.  The food is really great, and you can watch the cooks pulling the noodles right in front of you, to order.  The service is typically awesome (including hot oil or soy sauce at no charge, upon request), but my biggest complaint is actually their location in Dekalb Market.  It isn't their fault, but the Caribbean stall next door blasts music so loud that it can be difficult to justify waiting in line for Hana, unless you already know that it's worth the wait.  My tip is to put in your ear plugs and wait it out - hand pulled noodles from Hana are definitely worth a bit of inconvenience.", "author": "Ryan S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-18", "description": "Came here since I was craving a bowl of warm noodle soup, and getting the lanzhou beef noodle soup here with \u5fae\u8fa3 (low spice), I'd say it partially satisfied that craving. You get a medium sized bowl with beef slices and bok choy in a hot broth. I've definitely had more savory broth elsewhere! The chili oil they add is pretty spicy so I'd recommend getting little to no spice if spicy is not your jive. To customize, you can also choose between rice vs. round vs. flat wide noodles.\n\nPros: Fast service, lots of seating in this corner of the food hall\n\nCons: Portion sizes could've been larger, soup base was average", "author": "Yang Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-14", "description": "Chewy handpulled noodles!!\n\nNoodles tasted great and fresh.

They are located in the back of the Dekalb Market food court, next to Likkle Jerk and Doner Kebab, right next to the big seating area.

The noodles were cooked al dente and were nice and springy, the beef had good flavor and the right kind of spiciness. However, the dish was served lukewarm and the beef was a bit too salty, which just deflated all my expectations. How does a noodle shop serve lukewarm noodle soup??
