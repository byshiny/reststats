Not my favorite vegan spot. Not sure if I'm returning. But the Roasted Banana Walnut Ice Cream made almost  every other qualm disappear. So creamy and delicious. I've had aleast six of the apps at this point \u0026 if I am pressed to choose here, then: the vegan ice cream and mango avocado roll. The dishes here seemed to be more plant based which may be important for you. I just care about taste. Nice place. Super friendly staff.

Like whoa I wasn't expecting to even try it but it came with the House Bi Bim Bap, featured in the pictures and it was delicious. The bowl I got was great as well, however I did not eat the soy/wheat meat it was not good no flavor and looked like it was cold and chewy. But literally everything else in the bowl was tasty. I also ordered a small Green Jasmine tea, very yummy and it's served in a cute kettle with small cup all to yourself. I had about 7 cups from the small, and there was more tea in the kettle. Very happy about that decision. The only disappointment was the fake meat...the atmosphere was cool, I went there by myself, I was starving and wanted something healthy. It was quiet and the servers weren't that friendly but they weren't rude. Just regular service. I would recommend this spot for Veggies or vegans or someone wanting to try a different type of Asian.", "author": "Brittany M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-13", "description": "The place rocks.

It's a cute little spot that's warm, and comfortable. The staff are friendly and attentive. I'm not vegan but my friend just recently became vegan so I was being supportive. We ordered the crispy soy protein, pumpkin soup and bibimbop. The crispy soy protein was alright in my opinion. I feel like it lacked flavor. The pumpkin soup and the bibimbop, however, were to die for. It was so unbelievably good, I finished every last drop of my soup and every last bite of my bibimbop. I would definitely come back to explore other dishes on the menu.", "author": "Jessica A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-17", "description": "This restaurant has an extensive all-vegan menu.

Today I went here for lunch with three friends and the service was so bad we couldn't stop laughing. The waitress was almost like the \"soup nazi\" from Seinfeld. So uncaring, unfriendly. She had zero patience. My friend is very visibly 9 months pregnant and had a question about a dish containing sugar since she had diabetes and the waitress said \"I don't have time for questions. I come back when you read the menu again.\" We asked for water 3x. Finally the water arrived and one of the glasses were filthy. I ordered a soup and was brought a salad. The food was practically thrown at us it was pretty hysterical.

Talk about notice to detail! \n\nWhen I asked my server what the passion fruit tea consisted of, she immediately somehow knew that I was asking whether or not it was sweetened and addressed my concern right away without me even asking! And when I was conflicted between the passion fruit tea and the passion fruit lemonade, she offered to get me a lemon to drink with my passion fruit tea (since the latter option was sweetened whereas the former was not). \n\nAs for my house bibimbap- wow. I couldn't believe I had paid similar prices to eat mediocre bibimbap at the Korean restaurant just several blocks down when I could have had the one here all this time. It had all my favorite ingredients (i.e. kelp, kimchi, avocado), as well as my not so favorite ingredients (i.e. chickpeas), but the combo worked so well that I didn't even realize I was eating a super healthy bowl. \n\nAnd the complementary pumpkin soup- deeeelicious. I was skeptical of how good the soup would be because korean pumpkin soups had set such a high standard for me, but the one here was quite nice. The stock had a deep flavor to it- I could tell they brewed out onions and other goodies to make the stock taste more complex. And the pumpkins were oh so sweet and soft. \n\nI did spend twice as much on lunch as I would have elsewhere, but it was well worth the money (though I'll probably skip the tea next time).

I actually prefer vegetarian restaurants over the normal \nFrom the recent change to vegetarianism I have found that it's difficult to eat out with friends when you share dishes, as you almost always have to order an additional vegetarian appetizer, side dish to share.  Not wanting to put people out, you put yourself in a precarious position where you either need to share your vegetables (my food!!) or you just leave semi hungry (hobbits second dinner?), so why not try to best of both worlds and eat at vegetarian restaurant instead?  \nThat's what you find at luanns wild ginger, there's great food, you leave full, and you can order all those side dishes your belly and heart desire... \nwhat I have tried...\nBlack pepper seitan, wonderful texture, flavor and you won't even miss the meat.\nSalt pepper king mushrooms, it makes me do the happy dance under the table, enough said.\nGreen tea noodles, flavorful and fresh, it's light with the greens included and makes me want to eat the entire bowl with the rest of my many entrees\nTofu skin wraps, delicious \"healthier\" option of an egg roll\n\nThese are the more memorable items, but everything I have tried has been amazing, waiting for my next opportunity to get here..", "author": "linda y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-08", "description": "Great substitute for Chinese food.

I had a hot and sour soup mainly because I haven't had one in year since I became and vegan and it used to be my favorite soup.  I was NOT disappointed!! It was so delicious and besides the egg missing, I don't think any carnivore would disagree with me that this tasted legit.  My husband and I shared the green tea noodles which were perfect.
