The dining experience is quintessential NYC phenomenon dinning. Expect a line at the door, which normally is annoying, but the view of the Brooklyn Bridge and Lower Manhattan is spectacular and entertaining.\n\nOnce seated the staff is fast and you'll soon be rewarded with some of the best pizza you'll ever eat. The decor is typical pizzeria and the jukebox can sometimes be very fun. One last tip -- It's cash only. \n\nIt's a must do while in Brooklyn.

And I gotta say Lombardi's was the winner for me. However, Grimaldis was close. The toppings, cheese and tomato sauce were all very good. I would say I prefer the tomato sauce at Lombardis but Grimaldis was also very good. The thing about Grimaldi's that I was not a fan of was the crust. It wasn't crispy, you couldn't fold it over and eat it because it was saturated with sauce so I had to cut it and eat it with a fork and knife. Flavor wise this place is a 5 star for me. Texture/crust wise I give it less. In any case, it is one of the best pizzas I've ever had.", "author": "Roxanne H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-27", "description": "After being a Grimaldis fan because of the Las Vegas locations, I wanted to try the ORIGINAL under the Brooklyn Bridge pizza. Truth is, the pizza options are slim but the pizza is good. Not great, but good. They also don't have a true beverage system, they give you a cup of ice and a 20oz drink of your choice, so refills are out of the question. Its also a little pricey but for the experience, its worth a shot.", "author": "David B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-29", "description": "I think that the reason why this place is so popular on Yelp (2000 reviews and 4 stars) is that it's one of the few restaurants around the Brooklyn Bridge vicinity and that you definitely bump into it if you crossed the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.  Also, the greeter at the front warmly greets and welcomes people here.  \n\nThe pizza was just meh here, nothing extraordinary however.  Looked very family style and the tables were all squished together to fit maximum capacity.   Had to shift the table and such when someone wanted to go to the bathroom.  \n\nAlso, the way this place works it that they serve the basic pizza but they don't have any special pizza.  Rather, you pay for each of the toppings you want on it and they're $2 each or $4 for speciality items.  But a large pizza is $10 and it's sharable amongst three people at least so price wise, it wasn't that bad. \n\nThe worst part of the meal was when we were trying to pay the check with a credit card and the waiter serving us rudely clapped his hands and yelled, \"cash only!\"  Geez buddy, sorry didn't know.  That guy did not get a tip.  \n\nDon't think I would return here and would instead make an effort to find another restaurant even if it is a longer walk.", "author": "Susan Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-12", "description": "Yes, there is ALWAYS a longass line.\nYes, you will be starving (and a little grumpy, if you're like me) when you finally sit down.\nYes, everyone does the same thing of walking across the Brooklyn Bridge \u0026 then stopping in for some pizza.\nYes, service will be a little rude \u0026 rushed.\nBut you will freakin LUV all over their pies.\n\nMy two dining partners and I ordered a large (about 8 pieces.)

Sliced meatballs on a pie, ummmm of course! The flavor of all the ingredients stood out down to the crust, I was blown away. Suffice it to say, I will have a positive memory of this pie for life and when I return to New York, I will be back for more. Now down to the atmosphere... yes I understand the building is as old as New York City, but that does not mean that the interior should suffer!!

You will have to wait in line. Just go ahead and face that fact before you get there and be patient. The good thing is, the staff has gotten it down to a science and moves people pretty quickly considering they're cooking full pizzas (they don't do slices.) One thing we also noticed - when you're standing in line, you expect it to be chaotic inside. It looks jam-packed and noisy, but it's really not. It's pleasant in there.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, the pizza was great. They use mozzarella and cook it in a coal oven. The pepperoni was also especially spicy and good. When you order, you pick a size (small or large) and add toppings. Toppings range about $2-4 each.\n\nI'm not going to say it was worth the wait, but it was definitely damn good pizza.", "author": "Heather A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-06", "description": "They don't take reservations so get ready to stand in line. But it is well worth the wait. the pizza is made to order so also there will be a wait for the food. They don't sell slices so you have to order a whole pie but taking the left overs home is not a bad idea at all. Bring cash they don't take credit cards.

Well I had heard so much about Grimaldi's I was so psyched to finally try it especially with my food loving sis.  Well we got a single small which was perfect for two peeps and she got black olives on her half and i got mushrooms on mine while we had sausage all over the pie.\n\nSo the pie comes out quick and the service is very friendly so everything is great so far.  Well once we started chowing, I didn't get that instant sh*t-eating grin that I was hoping for.  Instead, I felt a little let down.  Part of that, of course, was the expectations I had - damn them!  But the other thing was that our pizza was really salty.  Not sure if this was an aberration or what, but definitely it was too salty and that made it harder to enjoy.\n\nSad face...\n\nWell, the good thing is that I like some of the 'za I've had back home in San Francisco more so I think I may have to go get some of that to make a more fresh comparison!", "author": "Gene X."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-12", "description": "Really bad service.
