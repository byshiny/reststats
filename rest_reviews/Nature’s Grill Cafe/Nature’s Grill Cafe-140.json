Very reliable weeknight option for fresh juices, wheatgrass shots, and a huge variety of healthy food options. I recommend their rice bowls, especially the teriyaki chicken and glazed salmon bowls. Generous portions of good proteins, veggies, and whole grains. The salads are also large and healthy but nothing too delicious. Baked sweet potato fries are another hard to find healthy favorite to get there. No frills space but an upscale diner feel with nice prompt service.", "author": "James A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-09", "description": "Nature's grill is exactly what I've been looking for in a restaurant and was never able to find. I'm usually looking for a meal that isn't deep fried, cooked in butter, or topped with cheesy or sugar sauces and that's surprisingly hard to find. Nature grill's menu is giant and has all day breakfast, sandwiches/panini's/wraps, salads, and regular entrees. Prices are very reasonable where most things are $6-9 except for the full entrees which are $9-15. As I mentioned earlier everything they sell is health conscious in some way. Low fat cheeses, grilled meats, egg whites, bison burgers, vegetables, and so on.\n \nOne of my only issues with them is that they don't list the calories for anything, something that could really help me choose the right meal. I ordered the taste of China entree ($11) which I'm sure had a lot of calories if by no other reason but the sheer volume of food I got. The dish came with strips of steak and chicken marinated in low sodium teriyaki and served over broccoli and rice. It was pretty delicious. Now I'm a pretty picky eater and there aren't many vegetables that I enjoy but I still had a hard time choosing what to order here because there were just so many great options.\n \nI ordered delivery so I have no idea about the location itself. Nature's grill is the only place I've ever ordered from that charges for delivery but it's only $1 so it's not that bad. They told me it might take up to an hour which was surprising but they showed up in half that time. I'll definitely be ordering from them again (and again).\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI've gone to the actual location. It's got a real polished branding which is very uncommon for a restaurant with only two locations. Its set up is sort of the cross between a corner deli and a restaurant. If you're ordering to go then you can go up to the counter and order/pick up but if you want to eat there they won't let you order at the counter. They instructed me to have a seat and when no one was coming to take my order the girl at the counter just put my order in for me anyway. Table service continued to suck and ended with me getting up after my meal and paying at the counter instead of waiting for my waitress to make an appearance. Service and set up aside the food was still great and was presented quite well. The wrap was on the smaller side but was grilled and tasty and came with some healthy chips (something they don't give you if you order delivery). I'm still a fan.\n\nUPDATE #2: \n\nWent back for breakfast. Service still kinda sucks but the food was still good. I got the sweet potato pancakes with lean turkey bacon (which just looked and tasted like smokey ham) and 3 egg whites ($9). The pancakes were very good. There wasn't a huge sweet potato flavor to it but you could definitely taste the difference between that and a normal pancake.\n\nUPDATE #3:\n\nThe pizza here is pretty gross so definitely skip that. The Thai chicken was just ok and came with bland dry rice and a sweet potato with no topping or seasoning to it whatsoever. But I'm still keeping them at 4 stars for the wraps, pancakes, and some of the other dishes as well as their approach to cooking in a more healthy way.", "author": "Matt E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-30", "description": "I was walking toward Lemon Grass Grill when my feet (and hunger pangs) veered right into this spot.  I quickly scanned the menu as it was my first time here, grabbed a seat, and put my order in: Oh California--it's a grilled chicken wrap with avocado, spinach, sesame seeds and \"hot\" sauce. It definitely wasn't love at first bite.  My wrap was okay, and I expected more flavor especially with ingredients like hot sauce and avocado.  I anticipated a bit of a kick--but nada.  It was okay, but nothing special.\n\nThere's ample seating here and various menu options.  And the waitstafff is good.

He was very nice and made sure I was absolutely satisfied with my food, even gave me a free rice pudding sample to try. It was good. Just the right amount of sweet but guilt free. For dinner I had an Asian salad and ginger dressing with the salmon. It was very good. Again, health conscious. Lastly, I'm having one of their fresh juices. They have many combinations of these freshly pressed juices so I just picked the Popeye (I cant remember but its broccoli, celery, parsley and something else) and added ginger and wheatgrass.\n\nI do wish their menu was up online.", "author": "Denise P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-20", "description": "Before moving, this was our go to place for delivery - especially the salmon wrap, sweet potato fries and smoothies.

Other than that, the salmon was well-cooked and fresh, and I'd probably go back and try something else off their substantial menu.", "author": "Maeve C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-01", "description": "I have been here twice now- I had the Ostrich burger here.

Nice place, very clean, very big menu (could be quite overwhelming if you're very hungry) I ordered the sesame chicken wrap and asked if it could be made cold rather than hot- she said no- when i got it back to my office, to my delight- it was cold. I have returned here about 4 more times, and being the creature of habit that i am, i ordered the same wrap each time, got the same girl, asked for it to be made cold (since it was cold the first time i got it) and each time i get an odd look, and an some silly utterance such as \"i never heard that before\"  when actually she has heard it before, about 2 days prior when i came in and asked for the same exact thing. \n\nAnyway, i hope to break out of my routine and possibly try something else and hope it is as good as my usual.\n\nPS- it may not be as \"healthy\" as they claim they are...you can easily tell the difference if you have tasted food from Fuel....", "author": "Nikk A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-17", "description": "My go to spot for a healthy meal. Not too many places I can trust with my stomach.  Food is quality, it can be a little skimpy and bland at times ( you can always add a little salt) for the price.
