The servers were nice and quick. The chicken on the sandwich however was burnt and dry, so the sandwich wasn't great.

In the sober light of another day, these are perhaps the worst chicken fingers I've ever had. Things said about these chicken fingers when we ordered them recently:\n\n\"These remind me of gas station chicken fingers.\"\n\"They are like finger-sized chicken McNuggets, but worse.\"\n\"Ugh.\"\n\nThose are not good things.\n\nDon't get me wrong, we still ate them all because we had already paid for them and we are gluttons, but next time I'm trying to be fat and unhealthy, I can't deal with such nonsense.

A lackadaisical mood permeates this spot \u0026 service is a struggle. In spite of this, some of the food deserves four to five stars, which may explain the very mixed reviews. \n\nCase in point - the French Toast. I ordered it \u0026 it arrived lukewarm \u0026 bare (see my photo of the loneliest French toast ever). The waiter drops it off quickly \u0026 disappears. After waiving my hands \u0026 calling out, he finally returns. I ask him for some cinnamon sugar. He tells me they don't have it. \"Well, then just bring me the cinnamon,\" I say. He leaves and returns with the cinnamon. I take the sugar off the table \u0026 make my own. He stares at the concoction with a perplexed expression \u0026 walks off.  I'm stuck sitting there with my cold french toast - which would have been delicious had it been served hot. Shame. Onto the next dish.\n\nThe Eggs Benedict (see photo - so nicely presented it looks like it could be from a magazine) - served perfectly hot, delicious with a light warm hollandaise sauce (not the best I've ever had but pretty good) with a dash of what looks like paprika. And hash browns. All good. All delicious. \n\nBottom line - I think this place is ok if you stick to the basics. No frills. No thrills. But a good decent meal if you have the patience.", "author": "Marie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-31", "description": "I was craving a bacon cheese burger.

The order was not correct 2. When I called to tell them it was wrong the man got very nasty on the phone and hung up on me. 3. I was told I would only get my refund once the delivery man came to pick up the food. After waiting an hour for him to come back for the food I called them again and was told he was coming. He never came so I called again and was refunded the money. 4. When I looked at the cheese cake there was a hair in the cake. \nSo not only can they not get order rights, have no customer service, it is also questionable how they are handling their food. \n\nDon't order to go from here.

Uhm I'm kind of a fish and the more I think about water the more I become convinced that I must live in a tropical desert and am about to die of dehydration. And anyway, hello lady in a big white dress here, just give me some water-we all needed it.  Then, after ordering it took over 45 minutes for our food to come out.  45 minutes for grilled cheeses and eggs.  Yes we were a large group but the restaurant was empty and it's a diner....how long does it take to melt some cheese between two slices of bread?!\nLike I said the food was fine but overall not a good experience here.\nWere we a bit drunk?-sure....but it's a 24 hour diner in Gowanus, I would think drunk people are a norm here.  Also, we were very polite and quiet drunks...i promise! I worked food service in college at a place that closed at 4am so I can say from experience that it's possible to be friendly to all your costumers...plus I'd just gotten married-bah humbug to me!", "author": "Allana D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-18", "description": "Mediocre AT BEST \nOn a scale of 1-10:\n\nSERVICE: 5. I understand that it's a diner and we came here quite late but COMEON. The waiter barely greeted us when we walked in, and it took way too long to even get us started with a menu\n\nFOOD: 6. Got buffalo wings, jalape\u00f1o popper, egg and cheese sandwich, and pancakes .\n\nBuffalo wings: the chicken itself did not have ANY meat on it, was extremely greasy, and all I could taste was the flour. The SO called \"buffalo wings\" didn't have ANY buffalo sauce.. I thought buffalo wings meant having some sort of buffalo sauce or flavoring but no. All I got were mediocre chicken wings full of grease and fat\n\nJalape\u00f1o poppers: OK. I actually quite enjoyed this when it was hot but not the best. TotLly understandable \n\nEgg and cheese sandwich: my friend said his was actually quite tasty so yeah\n\nPancakes: what can I say? It's just a classic diner style pancake. Didn't expect too much \n\nPRICE: The chocolate chip pancakes were 11.50 and with added bananas came out to be 14. HOW could you charge so much for some little pieces of banana?

Coffee and menus at our table in under a minute, attentive staff and generous proportions of expertly crafted comfort breakfast.  I had scrambled, hash browns, turkey sausage and toast and Nancy enjoyed a low-cholesterol omelette and turkey sausage.  Coffee was strong, and the cup never emptied.  Had to box up and take home what we couldn't finish.  Friendly waiters, a joy to visit.

Wouldn't return if you payed me. Above all the service was complete BS. It was 4 if us. We orders the simplest of orders, 3 deserts, vanilla ice cream, and 4 coffees. The thing that bugged us the most, was that the server did not even bother to remember who ordered what. We had to switch the orders as soon as we received them. If the server tossed our plates any harder I would have needed a baseball mitt to catch these deserts. The desert were stale and when we brought it up to the managers attention he, pretty much didn't care or apologize, he even said \"fantastic\".  They didn't ask us if we wanted the deep dish apple crumble warmed up which we assumed was hot, being that it was deep dish. The vanilla ice cream came with fudge on it, which we also did not ask for, the chocolate moose cake and baklava, was stale. By far the worst diner I've ever been to in NY, and that's saying a lot.

The food is decent but the service is what I have the issue with. Specially the last time I was there. I took my kids to eat and when we got there they only gave me a menu. I mean granted my youngest one is a baby so I didn't expect a menu for her but my other daughter looked at me looking for her menu herself. She said to me \"I eat too mom..lol\".. Even though she said it as a joke she was right. When I tried to look for my waiter to get another menu i couldn't get their attention so my daughter ended up getting one herself. \nMy other issue was my waiter.. The first one I had was friendly with exception of not giving my daughter her menu but then he went to lunch and left me with no one to take care of my table. When I asked the next waiter for coffee he seem to be upset and have no problem showing his unhappiness. I know that they eat and I don't have a problem with that but They just need to figure out when to go to lunch.
