The guy who owns the place was coming out and calling people in by numbers depending on how many seats were available. Luckily I was by myself and a seat at the bar opened up pretty quickly.\n\nThe guy who served me was attentive and took the time to talk to the customers at the bar, even though he was clearly busy.\n\nYou can see the chefs behind the counter preparing all the freshly made pizzas to order.\n\nAll the ingredients in the pizza where so fresh, the mozzeralla, the sauce and the crust, all cooked in a coal brick oven.

We already knew what we wanted.  A Large Regular Pizza.  It is pretty much a Pizza Margherita which is definitely my favorite kind of pizza!  It came out within 15 minutes.  Thin crust, melted fresh mozzarella, basil, crushed tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and parmesan cheese.  It was amazing and one of the best things I had in NYC!  After we polished off the thing, we ordered a small pizza with garlic, shrooms and onions.  It was also delicious but if I had to choose one, it would be the first pizza we had.\n\nGrimaldi's is located under the Brooklyn Bridge which is a nice reward after walking over it.  The best part?  Located just steps away is The Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory!  Pizza at Grimaldi's is a must if you are a pizza fan like me.", "author": "Ali C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-24", "description": "Went here for the first time after my gf hyped it up for weeks on end. Stopped by on a saturday around 5pm.\n\nUpon arriving, it took 45 minutes to get into the door (understandable given the fame). After ordering though, one of the waiters got upset over something w/ the other waiters and started shouting and slamming counter tops. This went on for a good 3-4 minutes and other patrons looked bewildered which made for awkward tension. \n\nAfter 30 minutes, the pizza came out lukewarm. It wasn't even hot. I asked for sausages and no lie, it looks like the chef had dropped little specks of sausages on by mistake; there were hardly any on. And the pizza was mediocre at best. The crust however was pretty good.\n\nAltogether, it was $20. Although it's not expensive, you could go out to a better local spot, save yourself an hour and 15 minutes, spend 1/4 of that and have a better time.\n\nI'm going to assume my experience is rare (e.g. the waiter outburst) and usually not the case. My gf agreed that this time around wasn't good for her either.", "author": "Sam T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-24", "description": "This place is definitely not worth it. The pizza is average and the service is horrible.  We walked up to the restaurant and encountered a huge line. You know how when you go to a club and they make people wait outside to make it look 'cool'? Yah, that's exactly what the vibe was.\n\nWe finally got a table but it took forever for them to take our order. Then it took nearly an hour for our pizza to arrive. No apologies. They should probably mention that there is only 1 oven and it will take about an hour to get your pizza. They responded to our complaints only with justification for their horrible service and said they would do something about the bill. They didn't do anything.\n\nThe manager came around and asked, 'how is everything?' and when we gave him an earful, he walked away. \n\nSeriously, not worth it.

Upon arriving, we couldn't get seated right away because half of our party wasn't there yet (they had trouble getting a cab). We waited outside in the cold staring at the yummy pizza and cozy customers inside. After 20 minutes of waiting in the cold, this jolly Italian man entering the restaurant asks us if we wanted pizza. We were kinda used to strangers at this point and said heck yes! He signaled us to come in and told the host to seat us even our whole party wasn't there. \"Get these ladies some pizza, it's cold outside!\"\n\nOnce our party arrived, we ordered two pizzas. One with olives and sausages. The other with sundried tomatoes, garlic, and mushrooms. The latter was seriously THE BEST PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD! HANDS DOWN. The price was also amazing. The six of us paid a little over $10 (even with a few orders of drinks). I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area.\n\nWe found out the jolly Italian man was the owner himself. He came by during our meal to see how we were doing.

And we did. We stood in line for almost two hours. Was it worth it? Yes. Would I do it again? Probably not.\n\nI'd easily wait half an hour for these pizzas though -- delicious thin crust pizzas with chewy flavorful dough. The toppings are pretty expensive, but you really don't need them, what makes Grimaldi's shine is the dough and it's delicate ratio between cheese and sauce.\n\nTip: Get one of your friends to stand in line, walk around the corner to Jacque Torres and eat some salted caramel ice cream while you wait in line.

With that said its not nearly as good now that they have changed location and lost the original oven.  It as grandfathered into the last place they had but when they moved down the street they had to leave the oven because of the new laws.

This place has plenty of it. When I travel, food is a big thing for me, and so my expectations are set high. A friend of mine recommended this place, and this place did not disappoint. Set under the Brooklyn Bridge, Grimaldi's is known to be one of the places to go have a New York pizza. The wait time can be crazy ridiculous at times, and the way they handle the line, is a little bit on the old school side, but it works. Grimaldi's has been around for a while, and whatever isn't broken doesn't need to be fixed.\n\nThe wait is long. The service is par, but you have to understand that each server is handling a whole lot of things at once. This place is NOT for the impatient. Patience is rewarded with a one of a kind type of pie. The pizza is easily one of the best ones I have ever had. It actually changed how I see pizza as I know it. This is one of two places in New York that I feel define what New York pizza is. Mind you, I am a Californian that hasn't tried ALL of what New York has to offer.

Although the wait wasn't too long (about 30min for 2ppl) we were getting irritated because the groups that came after us were being seated before us.  After we got in, we realized that their seating method was just a strategic way for them to cram as many people into their tiny tables.  While it's a smart way for them to maximize their profit, it's not a great way of customer service.\n\nOn to the pizza:  We ordered a Large Pizza with sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms.  When it came, it was huge! When we took our first bite it was delicious!  Loved the thin crust!
