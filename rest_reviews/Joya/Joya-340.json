The food was good and I especially loved the ambiance. While I was waiting, I had a nice chat with the owner who was very friendly and warm. Overall a nice place that I will revisit. Only wished that they take reservations but I can see why they don't given that it gets incredibly packed without reservations.

It isn't anything that exciting, but what it is is decent thai that is affordable and has large portions. I can usually split most meals into two which is nice ha ha.  I have eaten here for lunch a number of times and also dinner. Dinner is the more \"poppin'\" time, it gets packed and I often see a wait. I don't know how long the waits get, but I wouldn't wait to eat here. But definitely pop in, if you are in the neighborhood and have a hankering for thai.", "author": "Sharon K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-03", "description": "Indoor outdoor seating, ambiance just right for any occasion. Traditional Thai open kitchen style. High chairs available for the babes. \n\nMenu: Appetizer and specials, regular meal menu and drink menu. (There is a bar)\nFood is tasty and affordable, love the Thai mussels, coconut curry and pineapple fried rice.\n\nBest of all Chocolate room is about a block and a half away, gotta try brownie sundae and chocolate layered cake.

Our waiter after a long wait brings out our soup and leaves again quickly, funny thing though he didnt leave any spoons, so i thought perhaps he went to go get them. Few more minutes of waiting, Yeah... he wasnt coming back, found one of the helpers and asked him for spoons for the soups he eventually brought us our spoons. Aside from customer service I have no complaints. The soup (kind of cold by the time I sipped it) was good and so was the entree, I had the Beef Broccli. \n\nBottomline, good food, bad serviice.

Like another review said, it's \"Americanized Thai\". My recent visit was ok. I ordered a salmon with string beans and eggplant. Sounded like a light dinner until it came drowned in a super flavorful gravy. \n\nI get it, they cater to a different taste. I'm down with modern Thai--apparently in Greenpoint :X\n\nI don't feel I'll ever come back on my own, but a real good friend of mine loves this place; so there may be a chance. If so, I'll remember to ask for less sauce.", "author": "Salina M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-08", "description": "I was a little surprised that this place was rated so highly.  I liked the place, and in this area of Brooklyn there is not a ton of ethnic foods, so its nice to get something different.  BUT compared to other Thai places in the city (especially in Hells Kitchen where there are a million Thai places) this place is just ok.  Its reasonably priced, but so is almost every Thai place in the city.  I would go again if I was in the mood for Thai, although going to midtown isnt that hard either....", "author": "Rakesh M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-07", "description": "First visited Joya on a date.  Soon after I started working not to far and it's become a staple in my life. lol\n\nI get pretty much the same meals from Thai restaurants - Pad Thai \u0026 Pad See Ewe.

Finally a seat since the last time we were there was at night and many of us yelpers know its impossible to get a seat. \n\nThe food was ok but nothing that justifies the prices. I've had better in actual Thai restaurants in Flushing and asian neighborhoods without the long wait and pretentiousness. The music at night blasts at nightclub volume levels.

First time was Saturday night one time and it was so epically crowded it made \"human trafficking ships from Africa 1700-1800\" look humane and comfy. We dropped our reservation while watching diners trying to barely enjoying their time with deafening music and the waiting crowd or staff always 2 inches away from their forks. \nSecond time it was afternoon. Finally got a table and ate and to be honest have no idea what's the big deal. I've had better in less trendy hipster neighborhoods.

The staff was courteous and the hostess kept checking on us. We waited for a bigger table. We ordered the Fried Tiger spring rolls, the potato chicken puffs for appetizers. Food came out fairly quickly. For dinner we ordered spicy noodles with shrimp. It wasn't really spicy in fact I added chilli paste but it was still delicious. The fried rice with shrimp and Chinese broccoli was really good. My boyfriend ordered chicken and shrimp entr\u00e9e which came with a side of white rice but was extremely soupy. The food was yummy and veer reasonably priced.

The food, amazing.... and the prices are soooo cheap for NYC! Like, didn't even make any sense to me for how gorgeous the restaurant was, the vibes, the lighting, the decor, the location.. Such a dope spot.\n\nYou're literally good ordering anything. I'd get a few apps and an entree. And cocktails were affordable too. I will be back, and back, and back again.\n\nI've been here for a date \u0026 out with friends, and it works for both situations.
