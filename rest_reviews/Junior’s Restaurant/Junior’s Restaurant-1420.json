I met up with a coworker for a bite to eat and some work complaints. I had never eaten at Junior's but of course had heard of their cheesecake, but heard their food wasn't that great. Sadly I absolutely agree. Their food is not that good, especially not for the over the top price. I ordered the chicken fingers with honey mustard and a side of fries. The fingers were slightly hard with too much breading and the honey mustard was runny. The fries were good. I understand the concept that when you have one knock out product you tend to care a little less about the other stuff, but when you have an entire restaurant you kind of forfeit that option. I have had their cheesecake prior to this visit and it's okay, but I'm also not a cheesecake fanatic. I had ordered the Strawberry Shortcake at the midtown location and loved it, so I ordered it. This time I got a plate with a tiny slice of shortcake and a tub of whip cream. If I hadn't pushed it off onto another plate, I would've had four bite full of nothing but whip cream. A bit much wouldn't you say? I think I'll be passing on eating here for a while- awhile meaning until I'm forced by visiting friends or family.", "author": "Tonya C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-24", "description": "alright so their tagline is \"Most Fabulous Cheesecake\"...but i would change that to like \"shut-up for the next 2 minutes and let me eat!,\" or \"sweet jesus this is screaming!,\" i think you get the jist of my seriousness on how dayyym tasty this cheesecake is.\n\nso how do i put this... my department just invested in major storage solutions for some academic programs and well the vendor we work with attempted to send us this cake during the holidays.  they didn't realize we were already on vacation and on my return i came back to this box on my chair.\n\nit said Junior's on it and i immediately jumped out of my pants, grabbed some scissors and opened what i always heard was amazing, but never tasted for myself.  to my surprise i had a blue and green colored cheesecake and i swiftly grabbed the phone, dialed the vendor and said what the hell!  what kinda message you trying to send buddy?!  \n\nfast-forward to today.  iam in a state of zen-bliss from having just one piece of Junior's and i feel my political capital with all my collegues have increased 10-fold by my generousity in sharing that fattening, 3 lb., sugar-packed, food of the gods.", "author": "omar b."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-03-21", "description": "As much as i love their cheesecake, I would avoid their flagship location. I was here only once , maybe it was bad timing, bad night, oh well it was a split second decision.\n              around 11.30 in the night, i decided to take the MRS. for a date-date. we hop into my pocket rocket and head out. I could literally taste the cheesecake on my drive there. we get there , find parking after a bit of trouble and the rest is history.\n\nexcerpts of my email i shot to the owners on feb 11th\n\nTO DATE I HAVE GOTTEN NO RESPONSE.\n\n\nGood Day Sir,\n                    Hopefully the owner is reading this. I am one of your faithful cheesecake fan. Even before I moved to NYC, I was made familiar to your cheesecake by my wife while we were in VA. I am writing you this letter so that you can be made aware of some things i have noticed while visiting your historic site for the 1st time last night. On many previous occasions, I have had you world famous cheesecake only in you 2 city locations. Last night i had the urge around 11 pm , we hopped in the car and headed over to your site. We found parking with ease, and entered your restaurant. I was like WOW, like a kid going to toys r us in the city for the 1st time. After that everything went downhill.........My views are of an avid foodie with a touch of a business man.\n                    The counter on the right sells pies.I was very intrigued by the heart shape pies. I asked the host behind the counter about them and the prices\nME: hey, how you doin ,  what is on top of that heart shape pie and how much is it?\nhost: berries . 44.95 ( i could be off with the prices)\nM: how much for the plain heart shape?\nH: after given me a decent stare of 5 seconds , he said 39.95\n I was like ok , maybe this kid with his cap goin in another direction is having a bad night. I looked around and saw the section across where they had individual slices. We headed over there.\nM: hi, can i have 2 of these( pointing at the 2 plain slices)\nDifferent host, man in his late 40s , lookin hispanic. : pulls the 2 slices out.\nin the meantime , my wife had a change of heart, and wanted the carrot cheesecake\nM: sorry sir, can i change one to the carrot.\nH: ( visually upset/ mumbling goes to take out the strawberry on)\nM: no sir the carrot one\nH: i heard ya..\nwe pay , did not realize that there were no benches around to enjoy so we seated ourselves at the cheesecake bar. I realized it was not the right thing to do, but i told my wife wi ll leave a couple dollars tip. We also talked to each other about the 2 gentleman i had interacted with so far, and she said \" welcome to brooklyn\" I was like no, some thing ain't right. Sitting at that bar , I noticed a lot of things about your restaurant. The guy behind the bar name tag st. patrick  seemed like he was forcefully there, he never approached us/ never said a word. Infact all he did was stare at us in intervals at least 10 times. This man looked very sad \u0026 unhappy. In fact everybody looked the same, I was like whoa, even the folks at ihop are happier  and have a smile on their face, even though it was like midnight, it was still within your operating hours. None of your staff looked happy, I kept looking at the host who was seating people down. He never greeted any folks in, whenever people would walk up there to be seated, instead of greeting or having a smile, all he said were how many?\nIn the 15 minutes we were there, 4-5 employees clocked out, and wished goodnight to st. patrick, and he looked at his hand watch every time they passed by.\nMost of your staff at the time looked indian/guyanese. kinda odd, it is ok i guess. what irked me was whenever they talked among themselves it was in their native language, which is rude cause a lot of ppl could hear them talk.\nAs usual we could not finish our slices, I left NO tip, cause i was let down. I asked for a card from the guy sellin accesories behind me, the manager on duty was mr. Rama or maybe it was mr.Mohammed /mr. Ivan Forest.I would highly recommend you into looking into your service , send a mystery shopper and judge your servie or best yet diguise yourself and experience your service. It was BAD, the worst i have seen, and no, people in brooklyn are not like that. I have had the oppurtunity  to enjoy other place in brooklyn, and people are friendly.\n\n-- \nkaran singh\n p.s. your menu shows the plain slice to be 4.95 / carrot to be 5.75. i was charged 5.50/6.25 respectively.\n\nI will continue to eat your cheesecake, but doubt will ever go to your location again \n\n end of email\n\n2 stars only for the cheesecake, which would be 5 stars by itself", "author": "k s."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-05", "description": "Last week in NYC and I haven't had my first NYC cheesecake yet.

But as they say, that was then and this is now.  During my recent Holiday stay in NY we made the detour from Midtown to BK just to get our fix.  Sadly, I came away disappointed.  \n\nI don't know if we did or said something, but we had the distinct feeling that our group was bothersome in some shape or form.  We called ahead to find out if it there would be a wait to accommodate our group of 6 plus baby.  The response was extremely friendly and we were told to come on in.  Our group was meeting up with an old friend so we were all smiles, it couldn't have been our attitude.  Was it our abundance of coats and scarves?  I hope not, it's not like it wasn't winter outside.   Was it the stroller?  Our Stokke isn't an eyesore so it's not like we were being all ghetto or something.    When we arrived we were first brought to such a distant nether region of the restaurant that I truly thought we were initially being led out the backdoor.  It's not like they were super busy because they weren't.  When we innocently asked if we could sit ANYWHERE next to some other patrons our question was met with an audible sigh and sour puss face from our hostess.  All I know is that I never felt truly welcomed and that was a shame.\n\nTo make matters worse the food wasn't all that.  I've had a couple of incredible meals here so I was all geeked up to feast on the hash.  When it was time to order our sour puss waiter took half of our groups order and then began to walk away before we politely reminded him that everyone at our table would be eating.  I'm NEVER rude at restaurants, I don't ever want to feast on a green salt bomb and at this point on I asked everyone at our group to maintain their composure and not say anything until we had our food.  Shortly after ordering Mr. Sourpuss returned to inform us that there was no more hash and if the two people in our party who ordered it still were still going to eat.  What's with that?  Finally, when our meals arrived every dish that should have been served with hash browns had been substituted with French Fries (it was about 11am).  What's really going on?  A simple heads up would have been nice.  I would have ordered lunch if I HAD to have French Fries.\n  \nThe rest of the food itself was fine but at that point it didn't really matter.  I felt like a goof for going out of the way to recapture some faded glory.  When our meals were done we ordered several pieces of cheesecake to enjoy at our friends apartment.  THANK THE HEAVENS that the cheesecakes were the bomb.  Without the cheesecake they'd get nothing more than a half-star from me.  With it they'd only muster 2 stars.\n\nI may not completely boycott Junior's but I doubt I'll make the trek to BK just for them.
