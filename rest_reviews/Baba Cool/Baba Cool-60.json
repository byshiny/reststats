More like baba drool!\n\nSeriously though. Feel the need to add a counter review to all the 5 star Fort Greene whooping endorsements. Just ate here and the layout is not conducive to multiple groups, which is sort of a prerequisite for a breakfast spot. The breakfast sandwiches were simple and boring--everyone's plate lacked something basic. Sauce, vegetables, flavor.\n\nDoes this sound picky? I get it. But if a place is cramped and the food doesn't impress, what is one to do? Besides just going elsewhere, of course?", "author": "James B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-09", "description": "After a few brunches at Baba Cool, my conclusions are:\n\n- stick to the toasts, especially the avocado, the strawberry/ricotta, and the butternut squash if it's available.  Really high quality ingredients (especially the bread), very fresh. The kale salad is also a winner, but it is not immune to the overall problem with the menu (toasts excepted):  the prices are way too high compared to what you're getting.  Sandwiches are especially egregiously overpriced.  \n\n- if a seat is open, grab it quick.  People are savages in there when a table opens up.  Worse is that the tables are extremely close together in the small space, so if you've got a douche sitting behind you, chances are you're going to get an elbow in the back a few times.  \n\n- service isn't the fastest or the friendliest.  Iced coffee is very good, hot coffee is average.\n\nNormally I'd call Baba Cool a pass given the many other options in the area, but man are those toasts good.", "author": "David M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-28", "description": "After nearly losing my hearing at a spin class at the nearby Crunch, I swung by to grab a bite before my next meeting. Glad I found this place! It's true that this place is probably not for you if you want something fast. But if you've got a few minutes to spare, enjoy the friendly service, the laughter from regulars, and the scrumptious food. \n\nI had Baba's Dream, which was their sandwich special: roasted butternut squash, beets, and kale on white bean puree and smashed avocado. Nom nom nom. Came with a side spinach salad and I caved and got the lemon ricotta biscuit. More of a muffin/cupcake than a southern-style biscuit, it was simultaneously fluffy and rich. Supremely satisfying, though a little on the sweet side.\n\nI'm gonna go back for sure, if only because I am so tempted to try their brisket sandwich.

It's spectacular. \n\nThere are plenty of cafes that throw together a passable sandwich with fancy ingredients. There are, however, few cafes like Baba Cool that craft food so good it helps you understand how often you have settled for less. One of the things that immediately stands out are the novel, seemingly improbable, combinations. When I first visited, I saw that in addition to the not- uncommon bell peppers, the brisket sandwich also listed Italian sausage as an ingredient. I asked whether it was a brisket sandwich or a sausage sandwich. The chef replied \"both.\" It was amazing (see also the chicken and prosciutto sandwich). \n\nThe service is as good as the food. The folks who work here a great people who like great food. Once, after getting my sandwich, I dropped it on the ground. Totally my fault. I walked back in to buy a new sandwich and they just made me a new one for free.
