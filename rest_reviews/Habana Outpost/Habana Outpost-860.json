Usually get the tofu veggie burrito.  Sometimes gets crowded, but never has taken me too long to get my food from the truck.  Such a great experience.   Definitely worth while for people-watching alone. CASH ONLY though.

I enjoy the atmosphere. Really laid back. I wouldn't mind so much standing up to eat if i had to. Its like eating at like a fair or something. Lots of people to watch. I had a cheeseburger thinking it would just be something to put in my stomach, but I ended up loving it. I like that char grilled taste. Also, the frozen mojitos are nice. Perfectly sweet. I'll be back again soon for the corn.", "author": "Jonique H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-03", "description": "I went here two weeks ago and had the Cuban sandwich. I was so hungry and they forgot my order so I spent extra time waiting, while everyone's food looked really good for what it was. I knew this place was cheap and I wasn't expecting it to be the best, but the sandwich was awful. I have never, ever had anything so terrible and it wasn't like a Cuban sandwich at all. I can't speak to anything else, but do NOT come here for the sandwich. What went wrong:\n-The pork was way too salty. \n-The pork was shredded and was the kind of pork you would use for an entree w/ rice, not meant for a sandwich, especially when it's falling out all over the place.\n-The bread was soggy and not firm like a pressed sandwich should be\n-I got the tiniest slice of cheese and it maybe covered about a quarter of the sandwich. I couldn't even tell if it was really there. \n-There was no mustard. Now, I'm not even a fan of mustard, but it is essential for a Cuban sandwich. I'm from Miami where you can buy Cuban sandwiches on any corner and I have never seen or heard of anything like this and they looked at me strange when I asked for mustard, really?!", "author": "Carla M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-30", "description": "What's not to love about Habana Outpost?

Habana Outpost has a cool, multicultural, diverse, neighborhoody slightly off the grid vibe.  Wow!! This is that place you wish you had in your neighborhood where you can get a drink, an inexpensive meal, listen to some music and catch up with friends.  First of all, the place itself is adorable, painted in bright pastels and hues with a Caribbean favor.You stand in line to order your food (there is a separate line for drinks, bring your receipt to the food truck on the outside deck. Yes, a food truck...this place never stops surprising, grab a seat listen to the live dj's ecletic playlist and wait for the cooks to holler your name for pickup.  I don't think I have seen as diverse a crowd anywhere in New York.  I mean young, old, hipster, preppy, people from the neighborhood, fashionistas and toddlers running around.  It has such an unaffected and authentic community vibe.  IIt's also funky,fun and eco-friendly.The aesthetic of the outdoor space, the artistic renderings (huge colorful murals splashed against exposed bricks walls) and the egalitarian way of ordering makes for an unpretentious but still hip chill spot. And the food?   Very, very tasty. Excellent tacos, burrittos and quesadillas. but you feel equally comfortable just sipping a spiked lemonade, a mojito or grabbing a bucket of beer.  It's only open in the summer so catch the vibe soon before it's gone.", "author": "Joan S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-10", "description": "Love this place!

The vibe at this place is characteristic of the great atmosphere at Fort Greene.   There was always an interesting mix of people and it got crowded often, especially during film nights.  I haven't tried too much of the food here, but they do have really good and cheap local brewed beers.  The decoration is funky, and they have eco-friendly bathrooms and even a smoothie-maker bike.  A nice place to hang out during the summer for a couple of drinks.", "author": "Mabel L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-02", "description": "I got 5 words: Frozen.

Staff is friendly and kool the whole decor is really cute and fun. I had a couple of mojitos my friend had a sangria which in my opinion wasn't so great but she liked it. Apparently the corn is the popular item on the menu, but  we didn't have that. Just guacamole and chips which were satisfying. Outdoor seating is nice but it was chilly that day we stayed in. All in all I'd like to visit and try more food. It's a really kool environment to chill and have drinks.
