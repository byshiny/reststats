It was a nice walk and then a great way to finish our walk with some pizza!\n\nGreat pizza. I love that it is a thin crust because you can eat a few slices without getting full off the bread. My mom and I ordered a small with onions, mushrooms, and sausage. A small pizza costs $12 but comes with cheese, garlic, basil, and tomatoes. Additional toppings are $2 each. \n\nGood amount of sauce and topping and good ratio to the bread. The crust has a salty taste, but it was good and not too salty. \n\nProbably can't help it since it's brick oven, but the bottom of our pizza was sort of burnt. That was probably the only downfall of the pizza. But nonetheless, still good!", "author": "Chris K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-01", "description": "Brooklyn pizza, with Brooklyn service.\n\nCame here late Sunday night expecting a line but pleasantly surprised to be immediately seated. Inside what was a bank, this place has character and rich history behind it.\n\nApparently, their liquor license was pending, so I settled for the other beer, as in rootbeer. The 3 of us shared 2 small pizzas. Make your own! \n\nRed pizza had pepperoni, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms. Honestly, an amazing pizza! \n\nWhite pizza had ricotta cheese, basil, and Italian sausage. Good, but I bit dry for my taste.\n\nService was dicey, my buddy wasn't too happy, but keep in mind we're in Brooklyn. I know, no justification, but it almost added to the character. Waiters yelling and slamming on windows, bottles if orange soda and rootbeer strewn about. \n\nI think the novelty of the place awarded it about 1/2 star.

The pizza was incredible, the atmosphere was antique and original, they made the mozzarella in house, all the ingredients were fresh and the pizzas took 3 minutes to cook. It was the best pizza I'd had in New York and I've tried many.\n\nLast night was different however. The restaurant was new, the atmosphere was tacky, the logo was new and commercial and the pizza was like bland, cold cardboard. I was truly insulted. I felt like I was at an amusement park. Here were the exact problems with the pizza:\n\n1. THE DOUGH was frozen, not fresh, so the crust was comparable to matzah, and not good matzah. Every pizza looked to be the same size. There was no character to it. Also, the new oven needs to be broken in to achieve the proper temperature. This pizza was cooked at too low a temperature. \n\n2.  THE CHEESE used to be fresh made mozzarella. This was bland and commercial. They used to cook pizza at higher temperatures and add mozzarella at the right time/temperature. Because if you overcook the mozzarella, the flavor leaves. They cooked the pizza for longer time at a lower temperature and ended up with undercooked dough and overcooked mozzarella.\n\n3. THE BASIL. There wasn't enough! It was all in the center! Also overcooked.\n\n4. THE SAUCE was bland and I think they used canned sauce or tomatoes. It was cold by the time our pizza arrived at the table because the place was over air conditioned.\n\nDon't go here. I need to find better Brooklyn style pizza. It's a shame this once great establishment abolished tradition and quality for commercial expansion. That's the business of food I guess...", "author": "Roberto C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-26", "description": "Really good pizza!

He said it's the place to go for pizza in the northeast. It came up again, while looking through a friends pictures (mobile uploads) on Facebook and coming across a steamy, bubbling, thin-crust pizza and learning that it, too, was from Grimaldi's.\n\nType of cuisine: One antipasto, four pizzas (either small or large, regular or white), two calzones (small or large), a limited list of toppings and beverages, including sodas, juice, Snapple, still or sparkling water, beer or wine. And four desserts from which to choose, washing it all down with one of four hot beverages. Simple. Easy. But not mainstream.Ambiance: Their list of don'ts says it all: \"No credit cards. No reservations. No slices. No delivery.\" Apparently less is more at Grimaldi's. Walk through the glass door at the front,only after being invited in by your host, an elderly gentleman wearing a pin-striped, dark grey button-up shirt with charcoal slacks, white suspenders and an almost-black fedora. The doors lead into a small lobby, which immediately opens onto the cramped quarters of what is Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn Bridge. Red- and white-checked tableclothes cover each table, but can hardly be seen among the dozens of patrons, loudly conversing and making ordering decisions. Metallic lamp-shades make their way down, over the tables, from the ceiling, resembling lights you might see in a dark room where mobsters gather to play poker. The white walls are covered in framed photographs of celebrities, politicians and other famous types who have dined at Grimaldi's over the years. Wait staff hustle and bustle through the mini-aisles created between tables and chairs to bring 18-inch pizzas to drooling, hungry patrons. Windows facing street-side at the front of the establishment give way to natural lighting, though the back still feels dimly lit. The wall to your far right and towards the back of the establishment, from where you enter, is full of boxes and supplies on garage-style shelving units. The kitchen, open to the restaurant, is blocked only by a marble-slab counter top and plexiglass, through which one can see the large containers of fresh vegetables, pepperoni and cheese. The coal-fire oven just behind, exude heat and flames, which light up the kitchen, as workers smile and toss pizza dough into the air until it is cardboard-thin. Pizza and calzones are placed on cubed stands  to allow for a bit of dining space, on plates, underneath. Two trays covering the entire table for four.  \n\nWhat I ordered: My husband, good friend from Queens and I decided to meet at Grimaldi's after a weekend in Brooklyn - me, for a conference, my husband, to hang out and take in the street festivals and sites - we could not leave without having finally sampled Grimaldi's pizza. I skipped the afternoon session of my conference to get lost on the subway and wait in a 33-minute line, underneath some construction scaffolding, along Old Fulton, before being called in by the old man wearing a fedora, and pin-striped suit with grey slacks, held together by white suspenders. The simplicity of the menu made it easy to decide: one, large, regular pizza ($14), which comes with fresh mozzarella, crushed tomatoes and basil, and the addition of pepperoni, Italian sausage, sliced onions, mushrooms and fresh garlic (additional $2 each).\n\nWe also had to sample the large (18-inch) calzone ($16) with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, ricotta cheese, pepperoni and onions (additional $2 per topping applied here, too). To sip on, we had one Coke ($2) and two Olde Brooklyn Sodas ($2 each) in the Cream variety. When in Brooklyn...Right?\n\nWhat I loved: I loved the thin crust, the huge size of the calzone, the very fresh ingredients - from the soft and stringy mozzarella to the mushrooms and the basil, from the sausage that looked to have been rolled in house, to the crunchy, transparent onion slices...and, of course, the crunch of fresh chopped garlic, heaped to generous proportions on our pizza. \n\nWhy I loved it: I love the simplicity of the menu and the bustling feeling of the space. I love the smallness of the interior and the greatness of the food. I love that there are nearly as many employees - from kitchen-staff to wait-staff as there are customers in the establishment. I love that we were squeezed in, between two other tables, and no one seemed to think anything of it.\n\nCost: Average to high ($12-$16 per pizza with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese and basil or crushed garlic; additional toppings $2 each)", "author": "Mojdeh S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-26", "description": "Amazing!
