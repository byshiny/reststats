Yum!  Def some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I personally prefer Di Fara's, but the pizzas are so different I really think it's like comparing apples to oranges.  Whichever you prefer is just personal taste.  Grim's was delicious though, an amazing thin slice, good ingredients, crispy crust.  \n\nWe called in our order and walked right in to pick it up, didn't have to wait at all, so that aspect is a huge win.  I think I would have been a little disappointed if I'd had to wait in that ridiculous line.", "author": "Sherri M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-14", "description": "Tasty thin-crust pizza, solid ingredients, love the coal-oven char, but I have to say there wasn't anything that knocked me out of my seat.  I definitely enjoyed it and thought it was a good pizza, but shudder to think that it potentially could have been at the expense of hour(s) long waits.\n\nMy friends and I arrived on a Wed about 15 minutes before it opened, was quickly ushered in with only a few parties ahead of us, and were served promptly and quickly.  That's the kind of wait I would put up with for this pizza, but if I saw the line up snaking further down the street?  Probably not.\n\nAlso tried Lombardi's a few days prior to this trip - I like Grimaldi's better, found that the pizza was overall more flavorful, and texture of crust crispier and more pleasant contrast to the toothsome toppings.  However, I was a big fan of the pancetta at Lombardi's, of which there was no comparable topping at Grimaldi's.\n\nMy point of reference, the pizza I hold all pizzas up to? Al Forno in Providence, Rhode Island.  Their grilled pizza is absolutely exquisite and an experience worth making the trip out for.", "author": "Dan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-04", "description": "This is probably my favorite pizza in new york until someone shows me otherwise.\n\nIts got the thin crust on it and the saltiest olives in the game.

Line stretches 45 to 75 minutes, while the hype stretches all the way to the other side of the Atlantic (and the Pacific too, and I don't mean the avenues in Brooklyn).\n\nPizza at Grimaldis is OK, but nothing deserving of its \"reputation\".  There are better pizza shops in NY (may I suggest a place called Gruppo, for example).\n\nAlso, Grimaldis is a chain restaurant, just like Applebees, TGI Fridays, and Olive Garden.  With locations as far away as Hoboken, you get to enjoy almost the same quality pizza elsewhere, sans attitude, long wait, and bad service.\n\nBut on occasions when you have a friend visiting NY, who \"has heard\" that Grimaldi's is the best pizza joint in all of NY, and \"must go there\", then you have no choice but to go there.  That is a sure sign that the said restaurant has arrived in the \"Who is who of the average restaurants in NYC\".", "author": "Buratino M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-20", "description": "Yeah yeah, the pizza's good.

Pizza came quickly but don't insist on too much personal space. Tables are on top of each other. Crust was excellent but center of the pizza seemed soggy and kind of watery.

The pizzeria is small, cramped, not very fancy and there will undoubtedly be a wait of at least an hour but its definitely worth it at least once.  If you arrive about 20 minutes before opening or around an hour before closing, the wait will be minimal.  \n\nGrimaldi's uses a coal brick oven to bake all the pies with a temperature of about 900 degrees.  The pizzas take about 6 minutes to cook and are prepared with a thin crispy crust that has a charred, smokey flavor the way pizza was meant to be.  \n\nAt Grimaldi's there are no pre defined pizzas, you build your very own with about sixteen different ingredients to choose from.  My favorite combination is the the Sausage and Pepperoni.  The pepperoni is thick and tasty, sausage has a good spice and mozzarella is fresh and creamy.  Enjoy every savory bite! \n\nIf you're heading back to the 212 after stuffing your face with some amazing food, take the Brooklyn Bridge walk path to burn off the calories from that extra slice.  The walk has some awesome views of Manhattan and if you're on a date, there are a lots of nooks and crannys to sneak a few kisses.", "author": "Bassam K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-14", "description": "WAY over-hyped.  The line isn't long because the pizza is so good, but it's long because people THINK the pizza is good.

Oh, wait...it is a chain!  There's 3 of them!  Secondly,  the pizza wasn't bad but it was mediocre.  It's better than Domino's but it's not the best NY style pizza.  We ordered the margherita pizza.  The crust was the only really good thing, but the rest of the pizza tasted so bland.  Again, my husband's margherita pizza tastes WAY better. \n\nThe service was very good once you actually got in the place - the waiters were like super waiters.

I went here on Saturday afternoon and waited for an hour and a half. It was a gorgeous day, so it wasn't a problem, and I'd have to say that nothing tasted better than that first sip of beer once we were seated.
