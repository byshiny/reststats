Mmmm...soooo deliciously delicious.\n\ni've actually never had to wait long.  perhaps i got lucky.  the man ushering you in (older with white hair...appears initially kinda gruff, but actually is quite entertaining and funny) is freakin' hilarious if you get a chance to chat with him.  :)", "author": "Meilia Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-23", "description": "Out of all the pizza places I've tried so far, I think this place is so far the best thin crust stuff you can find.  The pizza set-up is simple with fresh ingredients.  There is a small line outside the restaurant but the cycle moves fast.  The service, however, is a bit slow and then a bit hectic at the end when they want you to pay and leave.", "author": "Jennifer L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-28", "description": "Good pizza and reasonbly priced.  Much better than Lombardi's.  If you are visiting NY this place is a must try.  You can enjoy a good pizza (close to the Metro station) and go over and take a look at the Brooklyn bridge right after.  This place is located right under the bridge.", "author": "Jimmy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-28", "description": "definitely worth the wait and was all that i heard it was. the key is to call them and have the pizza made for take out. you still have to wait in line but then when you get to the front you can take your pizza and eat it on the brooklyn bridge. thats what we did, and we saved ourselves about 30 minutes or so. And we got to eat on the brooklyn bridge at a bench which was nice.", "author": "Eric L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-21", "description": "Best pizza eva!!!!!!

Unbelievably long line, even on a weekday night. Once in, we sat in the middle of a table with six other people, but we didn't care because we were just so happy to finally be in. The service wasn't bad, they asked for our drink orders right away and our pizza came REALLY fast. I figure they just want to get us in and out as quick as possible. Okay, so we ordered a sausage and onion pie and it wasn't bad....I mean it's good pizza.....just not the best or the greatest I've ever had...I really wanted to bite into it and say \"HOLY CR*P, this is the most amazing mix of flavors I've ever experienced!!\"...But instead I said \"Eh.....it's good....\" Definitely not worth the long wait and probably I won't be going back because...I hate waiting......It was funny though, while waiting on line outside, a tour bus would pass every ten minutes and the tourists would all wave to us. A majority of the customers were tourists and once inside, they would all whip out their cameras and take pictures of themselves eating the pizza.....I just thought it was hilarious.....I guess it's a bit of a tourist trap.....", "author": "Kathy P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-05", "description": "you know, new yorkers are picky about their pizza. picky AND subjective. i have heard many claim they know where to find the best nyc pizza. us californians don't know much about pizza, but in my not-so-humble opinion, grimaldi's in DUMBO is the best pizza in nyc. went during summer, waited over an hour in pouring rain, and it was still worth it. the ingredients make it worth it. fresh mozzarella, nice quality tomatoes, the mom \u0026 pop touch...bellissimo!", "author": "Jess V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-06-17", "description": "We ordered a small pizza with ricotta cheese, basil leaves and sweet roasted peppers. I don't know if it's because of the ricotta cheese but the center of the pie was really soggy. All the cheese and toppings just slid off the pizza when we lifted it off the pan. They're also pretty skimpy with the toppings. There definitely was not enough toppings for the extra $8 we paid for them. It was good but definitely not worth what it cost.

I used to live in Chicago and swore I wouldn't like NY pizza no matter what.  I kept that view until I visited this place.  It was fantastic!  Everything from the sauce, fresh mozzerella, basil and crispy crust were great.  The only downside was the cramped seating at the Brooklyn Bridge location, but the pizza was so good it didn't bring down my rating.  Service was also friendly and fast.

We waited approximately 30 minutes to be seated, which wasn't horrible; I actually walked to a nearby dock to get some pictures of the Brooklyn Bridge and the New York skyline while my husband held our spots. Since we were a group of two, we were able to get a table before some of the larger groups that were ahead of us in line. We split a large pepperoni pizza. Unfortunately, our server got our order wrong and initially brought us just a plain pizza. He was super annoyed when we said we had requested pepperoni and tried to blame us for the mistake. Perhaps we weren't attentive enough when he read our order back to us, but as the waiter, he also should have been attentive when we placed it. I didn't see a need for him to be so rude when it was a simple correction: take it back to the kitchen and add some pepperoni. I assume working at such a popular, hectic spot can be stressful, so I didn't take his rudeness to heart. Eventually we received our pepperoni pizza. It was good, but it wasn't the life-changing meal I had heard it would be. The couple seated to the rights of us were in pizza nirvana; I thought they were about to orgasm with all the ooh-ing, aww-ing and salivating they were doing. The couple seated to the left of us seemed less than impressed with their pizza though, leaving a lot of it behind. Overall, Grimaldi's didn't live up to the hype, but the pizza was good enought to make it a worthwhile stop if you don't mind a wait.", "author": "Bonnie V."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Grimaldi\u2019s Pizzeria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "1 Front St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWKNFR58TIuA7M25dqj9rQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584300"}
