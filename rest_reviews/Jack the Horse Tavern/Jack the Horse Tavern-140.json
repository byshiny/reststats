Walking through the door on a Sunday around 7:30, we entered a busy restaurant full of stylish yet cozy decor and a lot of happy diners.\n\nTo start, I had the red and green lettuce salad with manchego cheese, plums, and herbed croutons.  It was fresh, a good size, and well-dressed.  Next, I had the polenta with tomatoes and a soft-boiled egg--a satisfying savory plate.  We split a side of perfectly cooked brussel sprouts, which also had a few bright, delicious veggies (I think they were pickled radishes?).  My wine was good as well (and the description on the menu of \"agreeably aromatic\" made me laugh).  My friend may have fallen in love with her mac and cheese.  \n\nAlso, the tavern has good lighting and a good bathroom.  Service was solid.  For instance, they ran out of the risotto and let us know before we ordered that they had replaced it with a new offering--also a good sign about a restaurant that they are running out of dishes on a Sunday before 8pm.\n\nI would happily go back next time I'm in the area.", "author": "Sydney B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-30", "description": "Writing this review on behald of my mother.  My parents took me here to celebrate my birthday.  My mother called 3 weeks in advance to get a reservation and to ask them to put a candle in my dessert.  When we arrived on time, the hostess seemed annoyed that when she called (2 hours before our reservation) to confirm the rez my mom's phone went straight to voicemail.\n\nWe were in a show, cell phones off sort of situation, and its not ridiculous to be out of touch for two hours before a reservation.  The hostess was snotty the entire night.\n\nOur food was overall good.  I had brussel sprouts and the mussels.  The mussels were excellent, my fathers hanger steak was a bit tough, and my mothers Mac and cheese appetizer wasn't all I thought it would be from reading reviews.\n\nDessert took a long time to come out- we all assumed it was because of the candle they were putting in the cake.  But when the cake came candle-less my mother was very upset.  I was fine, it didnt really matter, but if a customer tells you to make a note of it when making a reservation and reminds you three times, it really shouldn't be  a problem.  The waitress apologized and offered a free dessert though said canceling the bill and recharging could be a bit of headache.  My mother went over to the hostess to see what happened and the hostess said \"it's all my fault\".  No real apology, no offering to do something about, not coming over to wish me a happy birthday.  \n\nWe left and the hostess didn't even say goodbye.\n\nThis is one of the few good restaurants in Brooklyn Heights, I just wish their customer service was less distracted with a smaller attitude.", "author": "Allison H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-24", "description": "Came her on Saturday at 6:00 for dinner and drinks.  \nWe got off to a rough start when the hostess told us we couldn't get a table for two until 8:00 (I must point out that half the tables in the place are empty) or we could eat at the bar.  So we ate at the bar.\nStarted with some happy hour specials: an 1862 cocktail for me (followed by an old-fashioned) a glass of Bordeaux for Yaryna and we shared some mac\u0026 cheese.\n\nThe drinks were a steal at $6, the 1862 (a divine blend of cognac, orgeat, angostura bitters a wedge of lime and just enough cayenne to give the drink a little spice) is in the same league as the best concoctions you'd find in Manhattan.  The mac and cheese is as good as everyone makes it out to be...the second best tasting $5 I have spent in NYC (the best if cupcakes are excluded).\n\nFor mains, I got a burger with bourbon onions, Yaryna got the pork chop.  My burger was juicy and delicious and came with a side of fries (which were quickly pilfered).  The pork chop was tender and tasty, but I question the use of bland oatmeal as a side).\n\nService was bit of a mixed bag:  We had to ask not once, but twice for bread but otherwise service was quick.  Then there was empty tables...all through dinner, there were at least 2 tables that remained unused.  Why could we not sit there?  Apparently this has been a problem for a while.", "author": "Todd A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-31", "description": "Cute, warm place for drinks.

We like to sit at the bar where Aaron is the bartender and creator of many of the drinks on the cocktail menu. \n\nThe food is not too salty, especially good since we don't add salt to our food at home. And because there's not too much salt, the flavors stand out.\n\nThe head chef often comes out when the kitchen isn't too busy to check out what's happening in the dining rooms. He's open to answer any questions and listen to the customers.\n\nThe portions are just right. One appetizer and an entree is just the right amount of food. We like to order Aaron's specialty cocktails before dinner and have a glass of red with the entrees. With dessert, the bill comes out to about $125 for the two of us.

We first started at the adjacent oyster bar which is also part of the establishment. The oysters were very fresh! After having a few oysters we moved to the main dining room. They gave us a very spacious round table which is hard to come by in Brooklyn. Our waiter was very knowledgable with the menu and even brought over some books to entertain our toddler. For appetizers we shared a beet salad which was very good. The salad had 3 types of beets with greens and aged goat cheese. The grilled octopus was overcooked, however our dinner host told us that it's usually not so charred. I may give it a try on another night since I love octopus. \nFor the main entrees, we tried the pork chop which I highly recommend and the seared scallops, also excellent. The cauliflower pur\u00e9e was an excellent compliment to scallops and the hazelnuts added a bit of crunch. If you like Brussels sprouts, I highly recommend a side order. It was roasted well and cooked perfectly as with the other dishes. \nWe did not try the dessert. However I would definitely like to return to try their eggnog panna cotta. The ambience is great for small groups and casual. There was a decent amount of spacing between the tables which made for a comfortable dinner. We really liked the service from our waiter.

If you see a hipster guy with like greasy jheri curl hair and bad earring (maybe southern drawl but more likely bs affect)-- that's him. \n\nbtw I'm local so this isn't some out-of-towner whine. \n\nPlace was packed (so much is forgivable with a decent attitude) but dude saunters over like he's doing us a big favor when he finally swings by to take our order. \n\nWas there with my girlfriend-- and parents (elderly but sharp). He talked down to my Mom as if she was developmentally disabled. Told my girlfriend they weren't \"doing lattes\" today although we saw people at the bar drinking them? His tone was terrible.\n\nHe never fills the waters once. Never fills the coffees once. Never stopped by to ask if we needed anything at all-- although he passed right by the table non-stop. \n\nEvery time I tried to flag him down he did the full ignore (obviously saw and heard me) and eventually when he stopped by he acted completely annoyed because I asked for more coffee at brunch. (Which by the way he poured half-full with a splashy finesse). Matched him to a tee.\n\nI've had bad service around town. I empathize with servers when they're overwhelmed-- but this guy was radiating jerkiness that it motivated me to post on this DAYS LATER.\n\nHope he sees this and he changes his ways-- or somebody over there wakes up to the fact that you have an ahole server on staff.\n\nI'm an awfully nice guy. I've waited tables. I don't like writing stuff like this-- but that guy was simply over the top. Time for a career change, yo.

However, they are not particularly polite or accommodating, especially for mid to larger parties. I find it questionable and in poor practice that a place that is known as a \"neighborhood\" spot would not be friendly an accommodating, especially to others in the area.

No hipsters, yuppies, business diners, red-eyed drunks. Brooklyn families! Locals! Enjoying outstanding food.\n\nNice beer selection, lots of local brews. Mac and cheese, which is the reason why we chose Jack the Horse, is a nicely balanced combination of flavors with the smoked gouda and the texture provided by the breadcrumbs. Share it as an app.\n\nHangar steak was well prepared, and I really appreciate that it came with potatoes as part of the meal and you weren't forced to buy an $8 monsterously-sized side dish (ahem, most steak places in the city). That might be ok for a table of 6, not for 2.\n\nThe smoked trout salad remained light enough, even though it had potatoes and a cream dressing.\n\nFor a normally-portioned meal, I thought a shared mac and cheese and the smoked trout salad was more than enough.", "author": "Alexis S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-19", "description": "Jack The Horse is another great neighborhood spot - their drinks are absolutely incredible!

In fact, I want to love it so much that I am probably going to give them another chance in the future. Unfortunately, my experience so far was mediocre. I should say that I have only tried this place for brunch. Three of our party had the eggs orleans, poached eggs with fried oysters, a to die for combination, right??? The fried oysters were indeed delightful and eggs were well poached. The problem was that the Hollandaise sauce was kind of disgusting, or let's say \"off\" if we are to be charitable and it kind of ruined what could have been an amazing dish. I would be tempted to bet money that what I was tasting was a bunch of mayonnaise with a little bit of Hollandaise sauce on top or Hollandaise sauce with mayonnaise mixed in. Now, it is true that Hollandaise sauce is similar to mayonnaise in some sense. However, I saw what looked like white gobs. Perhaps it was badly mixed or just bad Hollandaise sauce in some other way. None of that changes the fact that it kind of ruined the dish. Partly, it was just way too rich, but it also did not have a good flavor and it drowned out the wonderful flavors that were there. While I don't like to speak for other people, I will mention that the two other members of my party that ordered the same thing did not feel the sauce ruined the dish to the same extent I did, though they agreed it was not a good sauce. The fourth person ordered an omelet and was also unimpressed. On the up side, it was reasonably priced for the neighborhood.", "author": "Aliz C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-11-08", "description": "Had a disappointing experience here prompting me to post a very rare Yelp review.  Called in advance to make a dinner reservation with my wife's family.  When I called, I told them we would have a small, well-behaved baby with us in a car seat.  I said I wanted to make sure that was alright.  The guy I spoke to was very nice and took the reservation for 7:30.  He said he would make a note of the baby so they could accommodate us at an appropriately-sized table.\n\nAt 3:30 the day of the reservation I got a call from the hostess saying there had been a \"mistake\" with their reservation system and they could only seat us at 6 pm or 9 pm.  Of course neither of those worked, so she cancelled our reservation.  Surprisingly, she wasn't particularly apologetic about the cancellation.  She seemed to regard it as our fault for not being prepared to accept the offer of a 6 pm dinner reservation.  (Who gets home from work by 6 pm?)\n\nThe odd thing is that a few weeks before, I stopped by in person and asked the hostess about making a reservation on a different night, also mentioning we would have a small baby.  At the time she also told me they could accommodate us only at 6 pm or 9 pm.\n\nIt's perfectly fine if the restaurant isn't kid friendly.  (Although maybe a bit surprising, since Jack the Horse bills itself as a neighborhood institution in a neighborhood that is full of families with young kids.)  I certainly don't think all New York restaurants have an obligation to be kid friendly.  And I don't mind if they have a policy of trying to seat parties with kids before the dinner rush (or after it).  But taking a reservation with full knowledge that it includes a kid, then calling back to cancel a few hours before dinner strikes me as very poor form.\n\nTry Sociale instead.  The food is better, the staff more accommodating, and you don't have to worry about the restaurant drumming up a phony excuse to cancel on you a few hours before your reservation.", "author": "Justin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-24", "description": "I am biased because this is my go-to neighborhood restaurant, but I have been eating here consistently (at least twice a month) for the past six years and have had consistently good experiences. The name is a bit misleading, as the decor is much nicer than I would expect for a traditional \"tavern.\" It can get a bit loud, which to me is a good sign, as it shows that people are enjoying themselves, but you can also find a corner table here or there where it'll stay quiet.\n\nThe drinks are excellent (Long Bottom Bramble is a favorite), they always have a good selection of beers (Captain Lawrence) and wines, and the food is always a winner to me. \n\nI highly recommend the Hangar Steak, the Mac and Cheese, and the Ricotta \u0026 Butternut Squash Ravioli. Their burger is also excellent, as are the mussels. Come to think of it, I have had most of the menu and am a big fan of all of it.
