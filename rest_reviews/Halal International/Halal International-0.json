But seriously a $16 for a dish of lamb and rice. :(\n\nI was excited to come here for a quick bite because it was cold and windy outside. This place seems to be perfect for a casual bite. The interior is very bare minimum with chair and table as well as a self service garbage can. I felt like coming to a high school cafeteria. \n\nI was hoping for a ox tail however they are out. Their price list is super super confusing and I will suggest you just get what your heart wants and expect to pay a little extra. Disappointed with no ox tail, I settle with lamb and rice but didn't realize it was $16. Oh well this is prime real estate. Don't get me wrong thou. The lamb is delicious and I will say garment if packaged better. \n\nService is none. You will wait at the counter and pick your food. Clean up after yourself and go. Being honest, I think they should spend some money on renovation and clean the table a little bit. \n\nOther food they have included hummus, Mediterranean standards and a whole fish which is amazing. I might come back for another try.", "author": "Kevin Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-29", "description": "I've grown up eating here, I can't believe I've never left a review!

Unfortunately, it was extremely disappointing. It's way more expensive than the halal carts outside, for what is actually less food. I understand y'all gotta pay rent and utilities but dang. My gyro had literally one teeny tiny cube of tomato. Didn't taste fresh. Chicken dry and bland. Just overall very frustrating, especially for what it cost. Maybe it was because we went so late at night.", "author": "Jocelyn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-02", "description": "Taxi cab driver paradise.  The immigrant working class's restaurant. \n\nThe interior is run down and reminds me of restaurants in Yemen. Defiantly 3rd country vibe when it comes to interior.  They got steam tables and make gyro or shawarma sandwiches. \n\nPeople serving are kind and speak both English/Arabic/and African languages to serve the customers.  \n\nI got a half chicken with Veges instead of rice.  Side of hummus, and 1 kofta.  There are a lot of varieties of chicken and beef.  The influence is Arabic \u0026 Indian like with curry style options.  The baked chicken is kind of dry.  Hummus is mad good and so was the salad and stewed carrots.  Kofta was nice, nothing to rave about.  \n\nThe platters are nice.  I had gyro and chicken platters before.  Nothing amazing, like most carts but pricier. \n\nI'd come back again to try the gyro sandwich but I'm assuming it's like everything else, basic. \n\nBasically a no frills joint with some basic Arabic/Indian foods that are kind of pricey and leave you like \"mmmmmm okay\"", "author": "Ahmed M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-09", "description": "Great no frills halal. Slightly more expensive, but much higher quality than the  truck down the street. I had the chicken platter which was excellent and not too heavy like some other platters I have had in the past. The Arabic spice was authentic and not too spicy. They also use cardamom in the seasoning which was a nice touch. The service was excellent, very respectful and hardworking people running the place. Lastly, they gave me a free piece of Baklava. As a Greek-American, I can say that the Baklava served here was some of the best I have had in a long time.", "author": "Donald J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-24", "description": "This is the place the family and I head out to get some really delicious organic halal food when we are taking break from shopping or just in the downtown Brooklyn area.

Wait staff is courteous and friendly. I suggest the lamb and okra if you like okra. BUT the reason I am giving it 3 stars is the atmosphere is AWFUL. Some of the people that sit around that place and \"hang out\"  ruin it. The other day I was eating in there and some men were in the back playing obscene rap music and one man called me baby.

I'm always in the 'hood (Barclays Center area), but this week was the first time I actually stopped to grab a meal. The food is fresh and delicious. I tried the whole Tilapia fish with basmati rice and spinach... yummy! The portions are massive (for me), I actually had the other half of the meal for lunch the next day, and it was still bursting with the same flavor. To top it all off, I broke the diet and indulged in their sweet treats with a portion of baklava and another delightful treat (cannot remember its name).
