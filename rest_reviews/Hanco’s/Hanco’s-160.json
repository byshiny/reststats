I was passing by Hanco's on 134 Smith St \u0026 spotted a sign for bubble tea so I stopped everything \u0026 ran over to get some. I have a serious bubble tea addiction which I am battling unsuccessfully. But hey, there are worse things in life. I had the Original - black tea with milk plus extra tapioca bubbles. If you don't like tapioca bubbles, Hanco also offers lychee jelly, green tea jelly, herbal and mango jelly. They also have soymilk and a nice selection of flavored teas without milk. I liked their bubble tea. They were very busy that day, the tea was good but I wished they'd given me more bubbles. Seemed like a normal (not extra) amount of bubbles.

When I entered this hole-in-the-wall restaurant, it was so hot inside and it was so dark as well. \n\nFor lunch: I ordered a Banh Mi with pork and when I brought it back to work, I wasn't too happy with the way it looked. I've been to places where the Banh Mi's were assembled a little nicer. I asked for a non-spicy Banh Mi and although many people before me expressed this Hanco's is great and their sandwiches are delectable, I just didn't feel that way.\n\nMy favorite place to go for Banh Mi's is Banh Mi Saigon. They specialize in authentic Banh Mi's. The likelihood of me returning to this Hanco's is very unlikely.", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-06", "description": "Friendly quick service. A very hearty original sandwich that will please a carnivore (the most meat I've ever had in a banh mi?) and vegetarian with every other bite. The bread was toasted and soft at the same time- a good texture. The prices are reasonable for the amount of food you're getting.

Good place to have bubble tea and Vietnamese Iced coffee. The vietnamese iced coffee is made with condensed milk, coffee and ice. It is a very alternative to ice latte.

I will say that there isn't much volume difference between their sizes..either that or they've just gotten my size wrong every time I order the larger one.\nThe white meat chicken sandwich tastes fresh and the bread is my absolute favorite.

I'm allergic to carrot, and there was one on a slice of ham. Luckily, I took it out before eating it. But I'm highly allergic to it, so I had to throw the sandwich out just in case there were any hiding. Overall, one of the worst restaurant experience of my life.

Do not get me wrong, I used to enjoy an occasional Vietnamese sandwich from time to time. All that changed after I had stumbled to this little hole-in-the-wall on the corner of Bergen and Smith St.  The way they prepare this bad boy has opened my eyes on how good a sandwich (not just a banh mi) can truly be.   \n\nThe heap of the pickled daikon radish \u0026 carrot provide the perfect acidity countering the savory elements of ground pork, pate, and Vietnamese ham. The trio of the meats work beautifully with the mayo in this sandwich. The baguette is fresh and the cilantro adds herbal freshness and crispness. The spiciness(they fine tune the heat level based on your preference) provides a great rush as well.  I recall having it for the first time ever and being awe-struck from the disbelief of how good it was.  Did I tear up? Did my eyes roll in the back of my head? I cannot recall exactly, but it was one of those rare experiences that  us, food lovers, seek out. It made me the true banh mi believer - i was converted from that first bite.\n\nI remember once trying their grilled pork sandwich, for the sake of variety. It was pretty good but failed to amaze and did not stand out  to me like their staple, the classic did. Since then, I have never made another attempt to try any of the other sandwiches on their menu (no need to experiment when you have a great thing going already).  \n\nI work a 5 minute walking distance away, so I feel truly lucky to be able to frequent this place at least once a week.  I have been to Nicky's Vietnamese Sandwiches on Atlantic Ave, which is not far away from Hanco's and as far as the banh mi goes, I don't even have to tell you who the clear-cut winner is. \n\nHanco's is a no-brainer.  Stop by, order a classic (or even 2, should you be really hungry), with a summer roll.  You will not be disappointed.\n\n~This review is mainly directed to the classic banh mi at this particular spot on Bergen.  I have not been to the other Hanco's establishments in the city.", "author": "Dmitry C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-13", "description": "So far I've only had their Vegetarian Pork Bahn mi.

Thanks to Yelp I found this place and just when I was going to step out the door to explore, serendipitously my bf brings home a honeydew melon one from Hanco's.\n\nSince last week, I have been back there 5 TIMES. For the meals, I've only gotten the chicken sandwich which is chock full of goodness. When I bite into the toasty bun and savory chicken with pickled carrots, it transports me to Nirvana. At $6 a 'wich, the passage to Nirvana is quite economical and so-worth-it.\n\nI think the ladies recognize my face because of my frequency and one of them gave me a sandwich card the other day. I'm actually embarrassed but I keep returning. I've been meaning to try other dishes but I just can't get enough of the bun's toasty goodness. \n\nTips: \n1) I got the whole wheat today to be healthier but I regret my decision. It's not as toasty/crunchy as the white bread. So do yourself a favor and just get the white!\n2) If you call in advance, they will usually have your order ready by the time you swing by. I know! I have them on speed-dial (hangs head). Considering I live less than 5 minutes away, it's pretty sweet to just walk in and pick up my meal in a seamless transaction. Pay-stamp-carry-and-go\n3) The drinks are meh.
