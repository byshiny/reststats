Faced with the dilemma of too many fast food choices my fiancee and i choose Applebee's for which i was very reluctant after my very first Applebee's experiance exactly a year ago (  a horrid dinner only to be almost forgotten by the amount of booze rendered in my drinks).\n\nFaced with a huge overpriced menu of chooices that looks like in consist of precooked frozen calory laden food...we choose the burgers...don't bother which they all taste to a degree the same...our polite server asked how we want the burgers prepared and we answered med rare for each of use.  after a pretty long wait we got our grub...i was super famished and put on the feed bag...could not believe how tasty the fries were and how tasty the burgers were if they did arrive a lot more cooked then what we ordered( thats why ketchup was invented to give moisture back to dry food).

My son's hotdog was cold and my daughter's chicken grillers was just a previously frozen, dried out chicken breast that they didn't even bother to fully cut into strips. That being said, we knew better than to come for the food and we'll give them a credit for attempting to have healthy options. \n\nThe real problem is the service at this location.  It took a really long time for the waiter to come around the first time. I'm just not sure if it's poor management or something else. We had asked the waiter to rush our kids food, which arrived quickly but before any drinks or even napkins/silverware. When I asked, the waiter didn't apologize, just said that I asked for the rush, implying it was my fault.  Not ok.\nThat being said, I'm sure he's a nice guy and it was busy on a Sunday afternoon, so maybe he just had too many tables and was frustrated???\n\nHalf star for being kid friendly and half star for keeping consistent with expectations.", "author": "Ali G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-11", "description": "This was the worse Applebees I've ever been to! You know it's bad when I'm still sitting in the restaurant yelping. Today is Veterans Day and I am a vet and I came here with my family and my sister who is also a vet. I am also in the food industry and server as well. We ordered drinks and waited fifteen minutes for them to come I asked for oranges for mine and it didn't come until I asked three different people for it and my food was in front of me. I ordered a soup and that also took forever. Finally when it was brought to me i realized my spoon was dirty. It took at least ten minutes for someone to acknowledge me to even get the soup out of my face. When my server came to me I told her what happened. She then came out to tell me there wasn't anymore. I was livid, not because of the soup but because of the matter of fact way that she said it. That's when I decided it was time to see a manager. When I tracked a manager down having to get out of my seat I tried to explain to her that I was a server and I understand busy but she kind of cut me off. I told her my needs as far as the soup and what happened said she could make it happen, but if there wasn't any soup in the building there was nothing she could do. Well there was soup and it came after my food was out. So as I sit here yelping no one has came to ask us if we were okay or acknowledged us. This is ridiculous and I can't wait to leave this place...I'm seriously just in disbelief if how bad this service is..WELL THANK YOU ALEX FOR SAVING THE DAY AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS THE PRINCIPLE.

My boyfriend and I randomly entered this place to get a bite to eat around 10pm. \n\nWe got the 2 for $25 deal. The food was okay, nothing to boast about. It wasn't the BEST food I ever had, but it was good enough for a chain restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a margarita and long island iced tea. They were great! \n\nI love the atmosphere. The wall art is really cool and the seating areas are very intimate. I dislike very bright eating areas and this place is nice and dark, just how I like it. I love the lamps, too. Our waiter was really funny and pleasant. He took care of us and we took care of him. \n\nIt is not loud. There are people sitting around the bar and either watching television or talking to each other. I see a lot of couples and friends having a nice time together. It's like another world in there. \n\nI am actually going back tonight because it is tequila day and I want that amazing margarita. I got the large one, which is the size of my head. It was made VERY well. \n\nI am not a super picky person, but my boyfriend is. The fact that he wants to go back there tell you enough. \n\nThere are people that are TOO sensitive when it comes to service. This is not a four star restaurant and no one is there to wipe your backside, with all due respect. \n\nI would definitely check this place out if you're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Irina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-10", "description": "If you're a vegetarian, there are just some places you shouldn't go to.  Sausage factory.  Pig roast.  Republican National Convention.

I ordered a soup and salad and then had to send it back because the salad had BACON on it.  IS NOTHING SACRED?  It wasn't even a *hint* of bacon, the bacon had solidly proliferated the salad.  \n\nUnless you're going for cocktails and appetizers, don't try to actually eat anything at this Applebee's.

Also, there tends to be a high turnover in the restaurant which also doesn't help.\n\nIf you're looking for a fine dining experience, Applebee's isn't for you, and you shouldn't expect it to be.  But, if you are looking for an affordable meal with a variety of choices, then I recommend Applebee's.  Dishes vary from pastas, steaks, salads, burgers, sandwiches and southwest dishes and there is surely something to please even the pickiest eaters.\n\nThe restaurant has tried to alleviate some problems, including removing the jukebox from the bar which was blasting loud profane music.  \n\nThe servers are for the most part, nice, but can also very easily be flustered due to the high volume of clients.  If you need something, be polite and it will help you get things quicker.\n\nThose looking to get drunk, I don't recommend dining here.  The drinks are made well, but are not strong and will only leave you with a slight buzz when you leave.  One of the unique things about this location, however, are the \"tooters\" or little test tube shots you can order in addition to your drink for $2.", "author": "Justin W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-02-13", "description": "Captain's Log - Star Date 12192007\n\nI came here to wait for S for dinner (not here). \n\nI encountered Brooklynites.
