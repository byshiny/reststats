I woofed it down before I could help myself. The Mac and cheese itself was flavored nicely and the crawfish was a good bonus to the Mac and cheese. \nThe catfish po boy was delicious. The bread was fresh and that really can make it Break a po boy. The bread was more like a baguette than a roll. The catfish was seasoned well and they weren't too cheap with what they gave.

I found for gumbo slightly salty but delicious.  The dollop of rice was a nice partnership.  \nI was not super hungry but am curious to try the half po boy and gumbo lunch special which only takes place Monday through Friday.  I would say give this place a chance.  \nIt is tiny but great for a quick bite .

First, they bring everything in from Louisiana and so it is very \"authentic.\" While that in and of itself is great...it also was very good. I am not much of a gumbo person, but I really liked mine. They also had root beer on tap...which is very hard to find.

The place is small and cozy, with just a sitting of about 12 people.\n\nWe ordered the green tomato PoBoy and chicken/sausage gumbo to share. First off, I love PoBoys but this was my first time trying out the green tomato poboy, and we liked the tangy fried goodness and gumbo wa\u200bs also very flavorful, but I wish Gumbo's portion was little bigger.\n\nOverall a solid place for a quick and fast southern fix!!", "author": "Vineet S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-16", "description": "I had tried the gumbo when this place first opened; and while it was tasty, it was not as good as what I'd eaten in New Orleans.

I had the seafood gumbo and a side of red beans + rice. The gumbo was the clear winner! It had a mix of rich, authentic flavors. The reason I'm not rating it higher is that it was sooo salty. I thought it was a bit pricey at first, but the \"cup\" size was surprisingly filling. \n\nIt took about 15-20mins for the food to be ready, which I thought was a bit long given that the place was half-empty. But there was only one young woman taking orders and bringing out the food (she was incredibly warm and welcoming). \n\nAll in all, not a bad choice to go in the neighborhood if you're looking for something a little different!

I have eaten it a bunch of times and it never disappoints.\n\nThe Poboy goes well with the Gumbo.

Deep, dark reddish brown with a spice that lingers just long enough to wake you up but not upset. The shrimp was plump and sweet, an ideal foil.

I had the Shrimp Po Boy and it was severed hot, loaded with shrimp that were crispy fried. And the bread was good.  The sandwich quality and service was really good. The reason I cant give this place 5 stars is because if you call yourself Gumbo you better know how to season food with a creole flare! Not only did the sandwich not have a drop of spicy, Louisiana kick it didn't have any kind of seasoning. I mean they could have at least through some Old Bay in there for good measure. Clearly whoever owns this spot is not from Louisiana, maybe ancient members of their family are but they are northern city folks getting over on other northern city folks who don't know better.   \nThe sandwich isn't bad but if you know southern flavors and are expecting that, you will be disappointed.", "author": "Cstuff B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-09", "description": "I heard about this place for a while and I always wanted to try it.

At first I was like no but than I said let's do it. I should have followed my first instinct and kept driving. First of all inside is tiny not a lot of seats. But while we were ordering 2 seats became available and I had to run like I was on a train to get those seats. We ordered gumbo and poboy catfish and shrimp.\nThe gumbo wasn't tasty at all it was hot but no seasoning just bland. So glad I ordered a small size..I was in shocked but I had an idea when I saw the clientele that this wasn't no Louisiana Gumbo. My catfish after one bite i just left it.
