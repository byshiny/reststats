They make amazing margherita pizzas here and they put them in a bag instead of putting them in a box like your typical pizzeria.\n\nThe sauce, dough and cheese are delicious.  The service is awesome as well.

AMAZING. I came in with my brother to grab some pizza. He had already been here once before, and he sung it's praises so I decided to take the plunge and hop on the subway over to Brooklyn. \n\nWe grabbed a seat and ordered a small pizza which came to be three slices for each of us. It was a margherita pizza that had tomato sauce that tasted like a fine wine. The mozzarella was fresh, and the crust was heavenly. It was a thin crust pizza cooked in a coal brick oven. At first I was in awe of how good this pizza was, then I started mowing it down and we decided to order another small. In total we had 6 slices each. When I got to the final slice, I almost wanted to quit, but it tasted so good I just couldn't stop. \n\nSo since we felt like a bunch of fatties, we figured it would be wise to walk back over the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan and walk it off. \n\nIf you want a legitimate slice of pizza in New York City, you NEED to go to Gramadli's. It's the best.", "author": "Mark K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-18", "description": "Didnt have a chance to get/eat my takeaway pizza due to an emergency, however was absolutely appalled by the service! Not only did they not greet myself nor the others who entered with me at the door but they proceeded to yell that we \"did not read the sign in the front\" and \"should be waiting behind the sign\" and gestured until we followed their instructions. When I returned inside to explain that I could no longer wait for my pizza and had to leave, their first reaction was to roll their eyes and say to each other, in front of my face, \"oh look, she's come back inside, now what?!???\" As if they believed I couldn't understand English. I am disappointed by how unbelievably rude and racist this establishment was, particularly for a venue that is such a local tourist attraction.\n\nOnly positive was that they gave me my refund when I explained that I had an emergency.", "author": "Sue Yean T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-22", "description": "I love pizza and I like to come here once in a while as a special pizza date night. Pizza is good. Delicious. But then again there's no such thing as bad pizza for me. Waiting isn't too bad ever since they moved to the current bigger building. Service is pretty bad as the waiters act like they don't need your business but overall it's good and that's why I kept returning here. \n\nToday, me and my boyfriend ordered two pies and it came out to $59 dollars. It was little too high for two pizza pies but we didn't think much of it and put $70. However, while the waiter took his time to get to our table as usual to get the check, I looked through the check and realized there's an extra $10 added up. We asked if gratuity was added and they said it is. Are you serious? Not only the 20% tip is way too much for their shitty service, it's shady and deceiving as they don't clearly say so on the menu or check. I'm not sure since when they added tips to every check or if everyone notices it but they must collect double on what they're supposed to get from a lot of tables. I know that we've been tipping on top of these gratuity-already-added checks. This is a landmark of Brooklyn for both tourists and locals and they should have the suitable business ethics. They probably don't care about losing couple of businesses now because they get endless tourists but it will catch up to them one day. Grimaldi is ruined for me.

Servers were friendly and cracked a lot of jokes with us. I'm a crust person - and I think it's important to get the crust of the pizza right. This place perfected that.  It has this yeasty flavor and amazing crunch. \n\nI ordered the medium red pizza with mushrooms and sausage \u0026 a plain white pizza. Definitely was wayyy too much for two people. Both pizzas were very good. The ingredients were fresh and the cheese was wonderful. It is definitely something to eat right out of the oven.

I had just returned from a three-week trip to Italy when I stopped in for lunch at Grimaldi's and my pizza here (pepperoni and Italian sausage) blew all of those in Italy out of the water.

Not just for the name and reputation, but the food is great! The reason for my 2 stars is from my recent visit to the Coney Island location. I have been there a few times mainly in the summer, however I decided to take my mom to Grimaldi's before she left for a snowbird vacatio to Florida. Coincidently she had a couipon for a free pie that she got from the famous summer concert series in Coney Island. So we went on a cold December night, ordered sodas a salad and the pie. The place was empty, but our waiter was still not very attentive. In any event the food was great so I didn't mind. It wasn't until I recieved my check that the trouble started. I don't mean to toot my own horn but I know what it is like to be a server and work on tips plus I have no problem paying for quality food. However my waiter was not able to tell me how my salad and to sodas came for 40 dollars!!!!!! Alll he could explain fro the scribbled reciept was that the free pie had a small service charge. Fine. Service charge, a ten dollar salad, 2 sodas and tax STILL wouldn't equal to 40 dollars. We ask him to go to the manager to double check why it was so much. Immediatley after he left, a female who I had peeped a few times giving me the evil eye, stomped confidently towards my table slams down the receipt and says \"18% is the service charge IT IS NOT too much\". Well I almost lost my composure because I am from Brooklyn, I do not do well with anyone charging at me let alone a manager of a buisness I am spending money at. LET ALONE , a buisness that holds meaning within it's name. I calmly ask her to break down the bill because it still did not add up. She started to talk nasty to my mom, even at one point telling my mom to let her speak.", "author": "Laurie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-20", "description": "First time hearing about this famous spot waited on line maybe 20 min because I heard lines are crazy here overall the pizza is really cheap a large pie is only 13$ I mean 8 slices that's very fair toppings $2 extra that's not bad at all.

I thought Grimaldi's would be a over hyped pizzeria because of it's name and fame but it's actually not. The ingredients were great. Their thin crust pies are very crunch and crispy. I really like the cheese they use and their not too heavy on the sauce. What I like most about Grimaldi's is that their pizza isn't full of grease and oil. I hate eating a pizza that is leaking orange oil. At Grimaldi's, I didn't get that at all. Every ingredient on their pizza is well balanced.\n\nThere are 2 things I dislike about Grimaldi's.\n\n1 - Their restroom was pretty nasty. Bunch of flies and mosquitoes everywhere and the floor was a hot mess too.\n\n2 - When I was waiting to use the restroom, I stood right by where the guys prepare the pizzas. I saw a couple flies flying around touching the cheese and other ingredients. \n\nVerdict - Still very good brick oven pizza. I just wish they were cleaner. When I see things like that, I can't understand how some restaurants can get an A grade posted on their window from the health inspections. There's no question that their pizzas are good but you can't kick cleanliness to the curb just because you're a famous pizza spot.", "author": "Gary L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-18", "description": "It's OK pizza, I've had better tasting pizza at Penn station.

I was directed here by a friend who was visiting New York the same time I was. This is a small and quaint place that seems to be pretty old. The brick oven used to bake pizzas has been there since day one; or at least that's what I was told.\n\nWe had a very simple pizza; fresh mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, basil and a very simple tomato sauce. The crust was extremely crispy even though the pizza was very thin. This is absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had in my life. In a nutshell it was very simple, fresh and delicious. I believe our pizza was about $18 which isn't a bad price for the quality and the size which was a large.\n\nI've heard the lines can be outrageous however we were there on a Wednesday about 5 PM and we were able to get a seat right away but it is a very small place.", "author": "Syl M."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Grimaldi\u2019s Pizzeria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "1 Front St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWKNFR58TIuA7M25dqj9rQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584300"}
