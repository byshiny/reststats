Asked for it well done (don't judge me) and it came back rather crispy on the edges, but that's ok because the flavor was good (I find that most places don't season their burgers, but this one def had salt \u0026 pepper at least). What I didn't like was that they only have cheddar or feta. What kind of burger joint only offers two kinds of cheese? Also, there was no lettuce or tomato on it (did I have to request that separately?) The fries were ok (reminiscent of McDonald's fries, but fresher) and onion rings were alright, nothing special. \nThe two8two sauce was a nice addition (it's mayo, mustard, pickles, garlic and paprika), went very well on the burger and as a dipping sauce for the fries and rings.\nWould I go back? Maybe if they give more options than just \"beef, cheddar and feta.\" I'd rather go to Burger Village in Park Slope.", "author": "Yovany C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-23", "description": "Wow. Super impressed. Drinks were awesome to start with. Had mezcal and egg white drink which was dope. Burgers were out of this world and probably under priced. Would have paid $20 for a massive \"pub\" burger with grilled onions and meat from local butcher. My wife's burgers with grilled poblanos was also impressive.

Look no further!\n\nFood - (5/5)\nThe burgers are top notch. Patties are delivered fresh daily from the local butcher shop, Paisano's. I frequent this butcher shop weekly and can vouch for their amazing quality beef. You can really taste it in the burger. I tried to breakfast burger which had perfectly crispy bacon but my egg was cooked a bit too much. That's on me for not specifying my preference. The Half \u0026 Half burger is solid too. You can't go wrong with any of the burgers honestly. The hot dogs are foot long which justifies the $10 price tag. Didn't try them, but th bartender devoured one and said it's his favorite thing there.\n\nAmbiance - (5/5)\nChill and casual. Went here on a Sunday night with friends and we sat at the bar. Great service and two small TV playing NBA games. The bartender made some delicious old fashioned as well. \n\nLocation - (4.5/5)\nConvenient location right on Atlantic so a close walk for any of the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods. Coming from Park Slope might be a hike but it's well worth it. \n\nValue - (5/5)\nExceptional food and service at a fair price. Burgers range from $10-13 and don't come with any sides. The sweet potato fries are a great addition if you're looking for something to compliment the burger.", "author": "Barney C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-18", "description": "this would have gotten five stars but the bartender made our rum drink with Whiskey.

The poblanos were really overpowering on the burger. Despite being roasted pretty well, the large slices of poblanos with their stringy texture did not fit well when eating a sandwich. Since you're cutting with your teeth, it wasn't a good texture especially when you have everything else to chew at the same time. Beef patty itself was pretty average and the two8two sauce was barely noticeable. There was a reason they served the burger with ketchup on the side.\n\nService - 4/5. Friendly and courteous.\n\nValue - 2/5. Their namesake two8two burger runs at $10.50. It sounded good on paper, but the actual burger itself wasn't good to eat. Despite the price point, it doesn't come with any sides at all either.

He even compared it to the shake shack and said that it was pretty similar taste wise! \nWe ordered a side of fries and it was a very generous portion. They gave us enough fries to go around and I do love fries. \nThe only downfall I'd say is that they charge for side of pickles. I get that it's only $1 but there was only 3 small sized pickles.. and also, the burgers don't come with fries on the side.

This popular hot spot is a great place for hanging out with friends, or dining with a date. I came here by chance, but am grateful to have found it. Let me get into what happened.\nI was looking for a place to eat with my brother while we were in Brooklyn. I pulled out my phone and went to Yelp. Long and behold, Yelp did not fail me. \"Two 8 Two\" came up on my radar. It was a ten minute walk from my job, so that was a plus. To add they had a weather guard up at the front door, so you know it wasn't going to be cold inside. Inside it was quaint and long. Once you walk past the bar, there's seating in the back. The hostess sat us in Brianna's section, a waitress that was very friendly. She filled our glasses quick and immediately took our orders. Looking around I loved the red walls and wooden seating. The place was tight, but seemed to get the most out of the space. In the summer, they have a patio in the back, if you feel like dining outside. Once I got the lay of the land out of the way the food came out. No surprise one order of fries were huge, so sharing is recommended. The new double burger was big and juicy to add. Looking at all the cheese and beef took me to my happy place. But it wasn't till I bit into the burger and tasted the beef and 282 sauce, that I started to sing. It was an incredible match. They only offer two types of cheese (Cheddar and gouda) But I understand why. The burger is made to support the taste of those two cheeses, they simply made a masterpiece and want you to experience it. That added with the home made fries and you have true fine dining. I would one hundred percent recommend this place. Great atmosphere, good service, and amazing food, make this a Brooklyn restaurant that's going to be on Atlantic for years to come.", "author": "Evan C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-12", "description": "I came here for my annual lunch with my team for the holidays.

The space is small, but very cozy. We had a fairly large group, and were given the space in the back.

Thankfully, we were automatically given individual bills, allowing everyone to come and go as needed.\n\nI passed this spot sooo many times when I was living in Brooklyn, and never went in.

Nice little place. The waiter was nice and helped get an outside table ready for us quickly. We were given water and then... nothing. We looked over the menu even though we were ready from seeing the menu before coming in. Eventually our server came over and we ordered everything, including drinks. Commence with more waiting. Everything then came at once, including drinks. Could of sold more drinks if they weren't served with the food. \n\nSpeaking of the food it's pretty good. Their meat is supposed to come from a local butcher literally around the corner which I've been to and is fantastic. I found the burgers to be a good size. They are not crazy big but, they are also not tiny like someone mentioned. \n\nThe turkey burger was full of flavor and between the toasted bun and the crispy bacon was on par with what I expected of a good burger. \n\nWife had the protein burger, it had a ton of lettuce for the wrap, she ended up disassembling it. Flavor was on point though so no complaints. \n\nSweet potato fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. \n\nThe onion rings were fantastic. Straight up beer batter onion rings. They serve them with ketchup, which is a crime. No ranch, another crime. I dipped them in the mayo/ketchup/relish mix which makes up their 282 burger sauce. \n\nOverall pleasant service and good food.", "author": "Scott B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-05", "description": "This has by far been the most seasoned turkey burger I've ever eaten!

One of the best burger spots ever. I've actually been eating here for three years. A friend and I did this Loaded Cocktail Passport event back in 2016 where we were given this card to sample cocktails from multiple bars across NYC. This spot was on the list. We tried as much food as we could during our trek the three months the passport was active. None of it lived up to the burgers and onion rings we had here. The menu, is simple and I've had about 4-5 different burgers on the menu. What I had here last month was the breakfast burger. I was in the mood for a burger with egg (sans swine). My friend and I shared onion rings and fries. Not sure what she had but I hyped her on this being an amazing burger spot and she agreed. Of course we had drinks which are just as delightful but the burgers overshadow the drinks every time lol. One of my favorite places. Always open to dropping by.
