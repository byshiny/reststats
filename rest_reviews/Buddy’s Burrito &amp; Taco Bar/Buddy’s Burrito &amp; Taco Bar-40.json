There was delicious tender meat, and amazing guacamole just doused in salsa and wrapped in the lightest tortilla. Ironically we didn't get any tacos...I'm not really much of a taco person anyway. But I'm sure I might change my mind if I had one of theirs! (Gives me a reason to go back again on the next trip.)\n\nThe location is great, open atmosphere and easy to get to from the street. You can dine in or get it to-go. \n\nYelping admission: Forgive me, but I was so hungry I didn't even care to take a photos!! But it's massive!! GINORMOUS!

It's a shame that the beans are not refried, and there is more emphasis on fillings instead of just the divine bean and cheese, but it's all fresh and authentically treated. \n\nIf you're on your way to Chipotle down the street, eat here instead.", "author": "Joe C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-28", "description": "Not mind-altering food but it's a good value.

I ordered the Quesadilla with shrimp, asked for hot and green sauce as well as pico de gallo which they gave to me. But once I got home and took my first bite, oh wow! So delicious. Their red sauce inside the Quesadilla with the shrimp was exquisite.\n\nBest ever!\n\nGive the guys a fan, though, summer is coming! They work really hard. The food is delicious.

I have a hard time branching out and trying new things so I only stick to the quesadillas. The chicken and spinach are awesome!

Oh glorious Yes! Buddy's is by far, my favorite Mexican joint in the neighborhood. \n\nThe Good: Obviously it's the food. Which is made right in front of you. For anybody craving a \"Big Lunch/Dinner\" try the \"El Grande\". It's fantastic. Also, their Brooklyn Burrito as well as their Vegetable Burrito are two personal favorites of mine. \n\nThe Bad: The only bad reflection I have towards Buddy's is the area to sit. Usually, the first three tables by the door are always taken. This leaves you with the back of the restaurant to sit in. Which sorta comes off as not a very enjoyable part of the restaurant to eat in.\n\nThe Terrible: Nope not here. Buddy's has nothing too crazed to speak about.\n\nWhat I would Recommend: Honestly, add some lighting in the back to enjoy my food. Also, it's going to be hard to view the television screen from this far back and the tv being cornered towards the front. Possibly think about installing another television for the people in the back. Which could end up bringing in more patrons into your restaurant.\n\nThe Grade: I'm giving Buddy's 4 stars. Why 4 stars? Mainly due to the situation with eating in the restaurant. Aside from this, the food is terrific and the staff are a great group of nice guys.", "author": "Frankie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-08", "description": "Great food, great price.

Use to visit often when I lived in Brooklyn and have been dying to come back and check out the food.  Since it was later than I like to eat I passed on the burrito as they are still in HUGE portions.  Their burritos can serve for two meals.  They definitely pack in the ingredients.  I actually had the flank steak with black beans \u0026 rice.  It was really good.  The price point is more than reasonable for the amount of food the provide.

You deserve better, but if you're like me, you probably won't care. \n\n2 stars because there's so much better to be had.

This resulted in us discovering the best burrito and quesadilla on this side of town. The burrito was muchhh bigger than expected- awesomeness! (must upload pic next time I go!)

You could tell the ingredients they used were fresh and high quality.

I love it.  It is nothing fancy and is not a place you wanna go on a date.  It is mainly a takeout but there is some seating.  The burritos are amazing.  The super vegetarian taco is so good you don't miss the meat.  Everything is made fresh so it's best to order ahead of time.  I generally get everything with shrimp and it's awesome.
