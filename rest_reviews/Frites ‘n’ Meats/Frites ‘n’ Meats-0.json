What else can I say that hasn't been said already. They just do it right.\n\nThe Burger:\nFirst, grab the menu and a sharpie and start filling out your choices. Whether you pick the BOTW (Burger of the Week) or create your own, I guarantee you're going to love this burger. Let's break it down:\n\nThe meat: always cooked to a perfect medium. Very flavorful and fresh meat and you can taste the seasonings, which aren't overpowering. \n\nThe bun: I always go with the brioche bun but they do offer a few selections. The brioche holds up extremely well. Has that perfect buttery flavor and just is the perfect vehicle to hold all the toppings of the burger.\n\nThe toppings: fresh selections and an abundance of choices. Don't go too crazy with the variety. The selections of cheeses is great as well. Seriously, who offers gouda anymore! THESE GUYS!\n\nThe Fries: double fried so perfectly crispy on the outside, soft on the center. PERFECT!\n\nThe owner taking your order is extremely nice and will even give you suggestions with your order. Awesome service. \n\nGreat Food truck doing it right!

Seriously. I walked out of work at lunch time, prepared to go grab something quick in 20 degree temps. This truck had a massive line waiting in front if it ... in the cold! I asked someone if it was worth the wait. They smiled and said yes. So glad I waited. If the fries weren't  the best I've EVER had, they were damn close. The burger was rockin' too. Like crazy good.

Excellent service, excellent food! I've been here in the past, but this is my first full service meal here (burgers and frites together). I came here for lunch around 11:50am on a weekday and there was already a small group of people waiting. I thought I had beat the lunch crowd, but I was wrong. \n\nI love the ordering system here where you grab a marker and menu card and mark off what you want. Excellent thinking and very efficient. In addition, they offer a loyalty card where if you come here more than 10 times for a burger you get 1 free! Another big plus! On my first try, I had forgotten to put my name on my card, but the guy nicely asked what my name was and wrote it in for me telling me \"No worries\".\n\nMy burger and frites were ready in 5 minutes and off I was back to my desk. Here's what I thought:\n\nBurger - I got the Angus Beef burger with cheddar cheese, raw onion, tomato, pickles, mesclun greens and ketchup. The burger was EXCELLENT! The burger was big, juicy and cooked to perfection (medium to medium rare). Nothing else I can really say other than it was a great burger!\n\nFrites - They gave a massive amount of frites in a cone. It was pouring out of the cone and there were plenty inside the bag when I took the cone out. Don't you just love when there are extra frites lying around in the bag? It's like free frites! The frites were fresh, crunchy and (this is in no way a knock) like Burger King fries. They were lightly salted and really good.\n\nBy the end of this meal I was 100% satisfied and full. Rarely do I get both feelings at once, but it was the case this time around! Look forward to coming back and getting my free burger one day (after the 10th of course)!", "author": "Chris E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-22", "description": "When I saw that there was a long line, I was a bit hesitant to wait for something I've never heard of... but if the line is long it should be good right?

Really a special treat, this burger. \n\nWHAT DOESN'T WORK:\n\nGuys, don't let your cheapness ruin your brand. Packets of Hunts ketchup? A definite red flag, and you can't possibly think it passes for organic. And you up-sell your Jazzy Sauce and Savory Onion Jam; .75 each, but then you just put on a tiny smidge of each--that kind of nickel and dime-ing is uncool, and New Yorkers don't appreciate it. \n\nAlso your \"frites\" are no bueno. They're hot and crispy and you follow the Five Guys model of giving way too many, but they are not the fresh cut pure potatoes in oil I expect from an organic brand, or for something called a \"frite\".

I hardly order anything with bacon only because it's not good for you. The burger was excellent! It was definitely one of the better burgers I've had.

OH MY GOD, these were literally the BEST fries I've ever had. They look like McDonald's fries, but way better because they were light yellow and perfectly salted and just so so so crispy. We didn't even need to season it with additional salt or pepper because it was up to par!  \n\nFrites 'n' Meats is a definitely must-visit for burgers and frites because it's just amazing here.
