I liked the decorations of this place. The food was average and did not stand out to me amongst the many sushi places that I have tried.

Always fresh, always delicious. I have been coming here for over 15 years, it never disappoints. Hot food is amazing as well. I recommend this place any time, but make reservations if you are trying to come in at a busy time. Sashimi, rolls, sushi, everything is great!!!", "author": "Boris F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-04", "description": "I can only speak for their delivery service, but it was top notch! Sushi and entrees for 4 people ordered around 2pm on a Saturday was prepared and delivered to our place on Tillary Street (normally a 10 minute walk away) in under half an hour!\n\nTheir menu is friendly to vegans, vegetarians, and people who don't even really like fish or sushi, which is great when eating in a group with varied tastes and diet restrictions.\n\nI ordered their Spicy Mixed Vegetables roll, Sweet Potato Roll, and Avocado Roll all made with brown rice, which they were happy to oblige. Three rolls filled a large box because each roll was cut into 10 pieces (instead of the normal 8) and was more than enough food for 2 meals, or one extremely hungry one!\n\nI was the only one in our group who did not order an entree, but they still gave us 4 miso soups which were warm, had big chunks of tofu and seaweed, and was not salty like many Japanese restaurants make it.", "author": "Stephanie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-06", "description": "This is my very first yelp review and I'm giving it to the Iron Chef!

The service, ambiance, and of course the food are all amazing.  I've been a patron of this restaurant since I moved to NY and was lucky enough to live around the corner from this sushi hot spot - 9 years!  The sushi is consistently fresh, creative and delicious.  There's only space for about 20 people in the restaurant, but the decor is super fun and the wait staff are amazingly friendly and attentive.  I think they filled my water glass religiously (I drink a ton of water) throughout the night, never letting it get to more than half way gone.  Highly recommend for a great date spot, place to catch up with friends, good place to take visiting parents - basically an awesome spot for anyone who loves sushi!", "author": "Katie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-28", "description": "This place never fails me!

The miso soup was better than the typical store-bought stuff most places serve. We had a salad special, made up of tuna, eel and I think mango. Next we ordered a roll with lobster, salmon and yellowtail in a sauce of ginger and apple sauce. The fish was very fresh and delicious.\n\nService: The waitress spoke great English and was very helpful as we asked her what all the menu items were. The food came out quickly.\n\nAmbience: New age architecture inside - colorful and chic.\n\nBottom Line: Wonderfully fresh and inventive sushi in Brooklyn Heights.", "author": "Adam H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-19", "description": "Generous portions and very well priced.

The staff is wonderful even when they are very busy. The prices are very reasonable and the seafood is always fresh. I steer clear of the wacky rolls with a million ingredients and usually opt for classic sushi or sashimi. The miso soup is the best I ever had. The special appetizers on the board are also great. \nThis is a perfect date night kind of spot. \nOn Friday nights you will need a reservation. \nOr expect to wait over an hour for a table.", "author": "Bianca G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-15", "description": "Food was too sweet.

Sweet, savory, and perfectly balanced (white tuna and mango combination FTW).\nMonster appetizer: A mix of everything awesome. I detected mango, salmon, crabmeat and avocado. \nYellowtail cheek: The meat was fatty, succulent, and savory, with the perfect refreshing balsamic accompaniment. \nSapporo roll: Soft-shell crab with jalape\u00f1o and roe. Delicious.\nUni: I'm not even a big fan of uni, but this stuff was ridiculously fresh-tasting and buttery, like a sea foie.\n\nThe ocean roll was the only dish that I found a little bland, especially next to the other dishes. Also, the salmon sashimi features the biggest slices of salmon you've ever seen (I guess whether that's a pro or con is up to your discretion -- I love raw salmon, so no complaints here). \n\nBeing that I'm sort of a purist when it comes to sushi, I hesitate to award this place five stars, given that its cuisine seems more of a riff on sushi-based traditions. But I definitely got a good slap on the hand for entering the place with preconceived notions.
