Not the last. The menu doesn't reflect the flavor combinations. You can only gets so much flavor out of a price of paper so don't base your decision on reading the menu on yelp. Had the whole fish and watched chef Andrew cook it. The broccoli and arugula is possibly the best green vegetable dish I have had.  Not enough room here to give proper credit.  Best part. Staff knows their food, wine and hospitality.

Normally I like to declare that all brunches taste the same to me because it is essentially the same thing everywhere (fancy eggs and toast) but Colonie managed to make theirs a little more special with dishes like Duck Hash with Slow Poached Egg and Fingerling Potatoes (this was a big hit at our table). \n\nThe biggest problem is that some of the dishes like the above mentioned Duck Hash were way too small and left us feeling hungry enough to order another dish. This in addition to the $4 coffees makes brunch a significantly more expensive meal than it is meant to be. So while I loved the food, I probably won't be back for brunch for awhile.

We sat at the chefs counter and watched them cook all of our food which is always fun. The service was great ; because the chefs were right in front of us they were consistently checking in to see how the food was. Our waiter was also attentive and helpful.\n\nMy friend and I really enjoyed our meal. We ordered octopus, liver crostini, brussel sprouts, steak, and doughnuts. The octopus was well cooked, not overdone, and served with potatoes. The brussel sprouts were crispy and served with bacon and dried cranberries. They also had a nice brightness to them. The crostini was good. The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned simply (but deliciously) and who doesn't love doughnuts?!\n\nThis is a great date spot, it's cosy, the drinks go down too easily, and the food is great.", "author": "Jessica Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-04", "description": "We went to colonie on a Thursday at 7:30 and got seated right away at a table (yes, they are a little close together).  The interior is impressive, warm, comfortable - really well thought out.  I am not a huge fan of open kitchens, and would have declined a seat at the kitchen bar, but it was kind of fun to watch the chefs from afar. \n\nWe had a nice fresh baby lettuce salad: crisp, refreshing, well dressed if a little unexciting - could benefit from some interesting garnish. The roasted cauliflower: very good, big portion, love the capers and sauce - the croutons were unnecessary and strangely very sour. The bass: good - but the nettles and other ingredients creating the \"bed\" the fish was on were sort of muddled and also very sour - way too much vinegar. My steak was very good. The steak sauce was really special. I wanted to lick my plate.\n\nThe date cake desert was delicious - the vanilla ice cream it came with was too salty.\n\nOverall very good but with some flaws that I really hope they can work out b/c I want to love this place. Wish I could give 3 and a half stars.\n\nPrices are a little high for what it is, but if you are celebrating, I guess its worth it.", "author": "Nora P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-18", "description": "Absolutely love this spot!  The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and it has a really great atmosphere.

Had duck hash sans the egg...tasty...initially looks like a bowl of potatoes but there is more duck in there than appears.

Also, this is all based on memory because it has been quite a while since visiting the restaurant (I moved cities).\n\nFirst off, why it can't be a 5 is mainly due to the layout. I went with my friend and her family (all foodies and restaurant people), and we discussed this when they seated us to the side near the window. If they had reorganized some of the seating, there could be room for more tables or maybe overall cleaner space.\n\nThe food is excellent. We got almost everything on the menu and split it between 4 people. The highlight for me was a pork chop. Cooked amazingly, which is a real treat because some places seem to overcook their pork to a point of undesired dryness. The desserts were all delicious, and whoever mentioned the doughnuts, amen. There was even one dish with a side of homemade mayo. My friend despises mayo and even she was able to eat it (it tasted more refreshing and less like you're being punched in the face with a sauce that should taste 100% like mayo, if you get what I mean).\n\nThe service is nice. I don't remember our server's name but she was friendly, not pushy or overly accommodating, and she recommended a good wine when we asked. \n\nOverall, I really cannot wait to go back when I'm in the city.

I went there last night and ordered the oysters, which were delicious, the mushroom pasta, ricotta crostinis and the brussel sprouts with bacon. Everything was just ok. Based on the reviews we probably should have ordered a meat but the pasta is homemade and brussel sprouts are usually super tasty. The Brussels were over cooked and very dry. The mushroom pasta had a good sauce on it but it was nothing spectacular bc it was pretty much a vodka sauce. The crostinis with ricotta were fluffy and the taste was super subtle. I don't think I'll go back again but if I do I would definitely go with a meat dish rather than a pasta! I sat next to a guy who order the pork chop and he LOVING the cabbage.", "author": "Kimberly K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-12", "description": "The best food I have had in a long time.

The most recent time we came the waiter was acting a little odd.  I asked for my eggs scrambled on my favorite duck hash instead of poached, as they are in the menu.  He seriously told me that I wasn't allowed to have them scrambled.  That they had a new *rule*!  I looked crestfallen, and said I'd had the dish that way before.  Then I said I needed more time to pick something else off the menu.  At that point he agreed to bring the eggs scrambled.  Culture shock - I live in the New York of \"Please make my latte with soy milk and half a sugar\" or whatever so I felt really annoyed.\n\nAnyway, the food is good, although the room is loud.

Restaurant is bustling and lively with great music in the background, kitchen is open for all to see. Drink menu is extensive and there's something on (or off) the menu for everyone. \n\nThe vibe of the place was certainly lively but not overwhelming. It was a pleasant sort of energetic that you feel at a place like ABC Kitchen, Perla, etc. I suppose the cuisine is very similar to a lot of upstart NYC restaurants, but the dishes are a little more adventurous than most. Food menu is a little small, I suggest looking at it prior to going in case you are very particular. \n\nThis sounds dumb, but when you eat here you really feel like you're in Brooklyn and away from the touristy/bro-y/annoying/be seen types of atmospheres that most trendy Manhattan restaurants have.\n\nOverall - food is excellent, service is great. It's similar to a Vinegar Hill House, but a little less kitschy.

We shared the crostini with ricotta and honey, HOLY YUM, and for our mains had the duck hash and cured trout. Both mains were super delicious!
