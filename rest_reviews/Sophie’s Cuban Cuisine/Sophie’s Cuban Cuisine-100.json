I  ordered their turkey cubano (as opposed to the pork cubano), which arrived within 45 minutes of ordering.  The size of the sandwich is smaller and slightly more expensive than other places in the area, but I enjoyed my sandwich nonetheless.  I will definitely be ordering from Sophie's again.", "author": "Michelle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-08", "description": "Consistently awesome.

The plaintains with their special green sauce (you have to add the sauce to anything you order) make it.

This is juicy, flavorful, stick-to-your-ribs Cuban* fare, and I recommend getting the Pernil with a Twist sandwich. Delicious roast pork, pickles, plantains... it was gone before I knew it. And then I was stuffed, because it was a VERY filling sandwich,\n\nThe staff was super helpful and friendly, offering suggestions as to what my friend and I should order. Next time, we're going to split the lunch special, which includes a sandwich and two of the delicious looking sides, for only 8 or 9 bucks. A deal!", "author": "Claire M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-08", "description": "I first became acquainted with empanadas through Colombian joints. On a recent trip to Miami, I discovered the Cuban empanadas and ever since I've been on a quest to find Cuban empanadas: not Argentinian, not effin' Colombian, but Cuban. You know? Castro, the embargo...yada yada yada. \nThis Sophie's is conveniently located walking distance from where I live, and while I have never eaten on site, I normally have food delivered to me. \n1. They never messed up an order.\n2. Food is filling, hearty and great.\n3. Picadillo, is made like a picadillo should be made.\n4. The soups have big whole chunks of meat. Other places are stingy with the meat and fill their soups and plates with crap loads of rice or yuka or potatos. Sophie doesn't do that shit. They have meat, no fluff or cheap tricks. \n5. Croquetas and empanadas are my favorite for a \"just right\" breakfast. The empanadas are filled with picadillo, which is meat and olives in a beef broth condiment, all enveloped in a perfectly crunchy non greasy crust.", "author": "Dullua C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-05-01", "description": "Ordered from here a few weeks ago, fast deliver but the food was lacking.

I got the oxtails, which are usually a signature dish in a lot of restaurants, and they were so bland. Not just bland but almost all fat, and very little meat. \n\nAnd to make it worse, I got it to-go and sat down at a table to taste it before I headed out, and I was rudely told by the server that the section was only for dine-in and I had to sit at the bar. I understand that might be the policy, but knowing how to deliver a message is very important in customer service.\n\nI will not be going back. There are cheaper tastier alternatives, and they probably wont be chains.", "author": "Imani P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-07", "description": "Great Cuban food!!

The sandwich was excellent, would definitely get it again. Goat stew came with two sides-we got sweet and green plantains, the green plantains with the green sauce are excellent. Chicken empanada and cassava with pork with pretty good too.\n\nThis place was inexpensive and we got a lot of food.", "author": "Bee C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-24", "description": "I haven't had a full meal here, just the empanadas and I love them.

It seemed like a simple enough order for a Sunday afternoon, but for some reason, it took an hour and twenty minutes for our food to be delivered. After waiting 45 minutes, we called, and they told us they needed a few more minutes. After waiting an hour and 15 minutes we called and they said it was on the way.\n\nWhen the food arrived it was barely warm, and the bread was a little soggy. The pork was very dry, the pickle, somehow, bland, but with the addition of the sauces, the sandwiches were \"okay.\" Neither of us bothered  finishing them, even though we were still hungry. \n\nThis is not a good place to order from when you're hungry.
