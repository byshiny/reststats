Ba Xuyen's spring rolls are more delicious, and they serve the best avocado shake ever!

It's certainly not authentic Vietnamese but it's ok. What happened to my body around 15 hours after eating the grilled pork vermicelli salad, was nothing short of violent. Right before redecorating my bathroom in the worst way one might imagine, I felt for a few minutes like I was on some sort of very uncomfortable acid trip. I was so full of poison that it took a couple of weeks after this episode for the nausea to completely disappear.

Pretty much anytime I order delivery, I have to order Hanco's. It's what I crave. I love the vermicelli bowl with shredded chicken and peach bubble tea.

The weather was kinda meh so my friend and I decided to get some pho. The employees there are really unorganized and helped other people before us even though we arrived first. We ordered, no smiles or anything but whatever, i'm not that bothered by it. We got our food and went to the second floor, it was pretty cozy and the pho was DELICIOUS. After we finished our meal we decided to get some bubble tea, i specifically asked for it to be sweetened but lo and behold when we left the store, my bubble tea was bland. :( At least the tapioca balls made up for the lack of sweetness. \nOverall, i had a pretty okay experience, the staff could look a little more enthusiastic lol but it was pretty good.", "author": "Iman M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-08", "description": "Hanco's is where you go when you can't decide what's for dinner and their banh mi is pretty damn good. Their distinguishing factor from other banh mi shops is two things:\n\n1. Pho. It's not the best ever but gets the job done.\n\n2. Viet coffee. I dunno why more places don't have it since it's not that complicated.

I haven't been to Hanco's in at least 6 years. The location has changed but the food is as good if not better.

We aren't sure if it was them or the salads we had later that day, though.  The place has an \"A\", so I'm hoping it wasn't them. Either way, the sandwiches were delicious, but food poisoning is no fun!", "author": "Lia D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-04", "description": "This is the best tasting banh mi I've had so far in NYC. The ground pork was so savory and juicy and wonderful...it more than makes up for the two flaws that I can see. \n\nFlaw #1: It's $5.50. That's just more than banh mi should cost (see Saigon Sandwich in SF). I've come to expect this sort of thing in Manhattan, but we're in Brooklyn. (It should be noted that Manhattan spots Baoguette and Nicky's both come in at $5, and those are on the high end.) Also, bottles of water at Hanco's are $1.25 and I think that's crap.\n\nFlaw #2: The distribution of the banh mi ingredients is off, and could easily be improved. (If you do not want to hear about how, please skip the nonsense below, and move along to The Conclusion.)\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, imagine that Hanco's puts their delicious, toasty baguette in a V shape. All the porky goodness is stuffed into the bottom of the V, and the pickled daikon, carrot and cilantro was laid on top. The problem here is that this is not a hot dog. It's just too big; you can't take a bite of the sandwich vertically, which might allow you to get a little bit of each ingredient in every bite. \n\nIn order to eat this sandwich without getting it all over your face and/or lap, you need to come at it from the side (once again, assuming we are using the V model). Unfortunately, this leaves you either biting the top of the V and getting a mouthful of pickled vegetables and cilantro, or the bottom of the V and getting a mouthful of porky goodness. Both of these are unsatisfactory, as you want to be getting both in every bite. \n\nPlease excuse the rudimentary nature of the drawing below, but the ideal distribution would look something like this: \n\n________Bread _________\n\n   Daikon/Carrots/Cilantro\n\n       Porky Goodness\n\n________Bread _________\n\nAs you can clearly see, this distribution would ensure that the eater would get both the pickled vegetables and the porky goodness in each bite. And although it would not be very difficult to build the sandwich this way, opening it up and re-distributing the ingredients after you've purchased it can get messy.\n\nThe Conclusion.\n\nI'd still stop and get a sandwich at Hanco's anytime, because any place with only two flaws is pretty damn good. I don't even want to think about how many flaws I have. Thank god no one reviews me. I bet I'd average a \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" I just checked with my girlfriend, she's nodding. \n\nAh, crap. Now I'm thinking about all my flaws.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-30", "description": "Spicy Classic pork sandwich with mayo, butter, cucumber, carrots, radish, cilantro served on a toasted French baguette, and EXTRA MEAT!!!

I crave it day and night.\n\nHancos is my favorite spot to grab quick super casual lunch or dinner on my way somewhere. I go by myself or with a friend and either way it's the best. There's good seating but it gets packed certain times of day. Because it's really good.\n\nEverything always tastes super fresh and clean. I always get the grilled pork sandwich. Their bread is the right amount of toasted (I live closer to the Park Slope location but I prefer this one because Park Slope toasts the shit outta their bread.) I hate both cucumbers and jalape\u00f1os and unlike other sandwich places in the city they totally don't mind leaving those out for me.\n\nTheir bubble tea has a pretty good amount of variety AND they let you substitute tapioca for other things. I like the mango star jelly and the strawberry jelly (which is heart shaped and super cute). They also have vietnamese coffee which I love, even when I'm picky with my coffee and normally don't ever drink it sweetened.\n\nIf you're an addict like i am, they have stamp cards that let you get a free sandwich or bubble tea after 10 stamps. I've lost count of how many of those cards I've filled.\n\nThe food is a little pricier than other spots serving similar stuff (and pricier than the other hancos locations too!) but for the area it's pretty good, and to me it's better than Park Slope hancos and therefore worth the extra money (both are on my way home).", "author": "Cristina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-14", "description": "No no no!
