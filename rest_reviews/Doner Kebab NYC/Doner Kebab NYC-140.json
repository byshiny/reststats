The meat is super clean, not oily or dried out. I've had the chicken, lamb \u0026 beef, and they were all excellent. The meat had absolutely perfect flavor. The rice pilaf is some of the best I've ever had also. All of the sides are super fresh, and the portion size is great. The space is modern, bright, and extremely clean. This establishment is a can't miss for either lunch or dinner.", "author": "Mike M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-02", "description": "I liked the owners (husband and wife) who were working hard. Some of the workers are just working frantically and never failed to give me something different than what I asked for. Food is very average . However don't get rice - instead of using regular natural rice they use some sort of parboiled rice type that are plain gross.", "author": "Nina K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-24", "description": "Solid spot.
