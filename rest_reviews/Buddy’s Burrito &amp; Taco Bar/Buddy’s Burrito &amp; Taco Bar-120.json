I always order the Brooklyn Burrito with beef and black beans. The meat is made to order which is what makes their burrito so flavorful. I am never left disappointed after going to this place. I can also say after going here I am very hesitant to go to Chipotle, it definitely makes you realize how generic their food is.", "author": "Jordan S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-28", "description": "I have been coming  here for years. I order a nacho platter almost Everytime. Recently it has not been what i remembered . It used to be packed with all those very tasty sides. Poco de gallo sour cream cheese beans guac chips and steak! But now it's a sad platter some days the food is badly spicy. And the platter itself is made cheaply with very little poco de gallo or sour cream sometimes very little steak and chips . It's sad I really love this place. It was great! And the people who are there making the food have been for years. They have been loyal employees. It's sad to see what management has become ( there is no achievement latter in this place)  . I hope they are being paid accordingly . They work very hard and sometimes being inside that store is unbearable ! It's a Mexican restaurant but it shouldn't feel like I'm in a Mexican desert. The owners are not Mexican so I wonder if there the ones who are telling them to add less ingredients. Idk but this place has changed . Also the meat is not put in the fridge it is on the counter sitting in a marinade. I only mention this because something's the store gets extremely hot so that could only mean a recipe for disaster. Again not the employees fault. But management. Such a shame. They make very very good business here on any givin day.", "author": "Harold A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-27", "description": "We visited the place Sunday evening. Just a random pick, I wished we would try out something new, a different place. I had a chicken quesadilla, he ate a steak burrito. The cashier was friendly and fast. Our food came fast too! It was delicious and huge. It was so good, my friend decided to visit it again and order a quesadilla!

The food is solid and is the best burrito available in the neighborhood.  Being a burrito adict I've had better but this one is decent and delivers.  Their Guac isn't bad either.  I can't speak for much else here.  I've eaten in the shop a few times adn was not impressed with its cleanliness which is something I try to forget when I'm ordering delivery.", "author": "David N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-08", "description": "Not a place for hipsters.

While the steak in my burrito was overcooked a bit , it didn't bother me much.  The overall taste of the burrito was definitely good enough to have me come back again and again.  There was something dirty about the food and the place but in a good way that made me feel like I am eating something authentic.

The second time, I ordered the Brooklyn Burrito and had to pay $1.50 for extra meat (carne asada), but I can't imagine why this amount of meat is not included without paying extra!  The nachos the second time were excellent again!  Moral of the story:  Order the nachos, or something other than the carne asada burrito.  Pros:  They cook the meat as you order it.  Definitely fresh!  Cons: Not enough meat in burritos and they charge almost $3 for chips.", "author": "Laurian C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-05", "description": "This food here is really good!

I've been on a big fish taco kick and thought I'd give Buddy's a chance since it's in my neighborhood but I never go to it.  Big mistake.  How does a clumpy piece of fried fish that tastes like it came from a frozen pack of Ms. Paul's qualify for a fish taco?  And I couldn't even bear to eat the sloppy regurgitated-looking vegetarian taco I ordered.  I will definitely stick to California Taqueria on Court and Bergen -- just four blocks from Buddy's but light years ahead in terms of taste and quality.", "author": "Tracy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-14", "description": "this place is NOT the greatest. if you want good cali style taqueria mexican, go to la taqueria or rachel's (same owners) in park slope.\nbut i don't live in park slope anymore, so buddy's is where i get my nachos.\ni have never eaten anything else there, but i've seen burritos and tacos which look totally \"eh\".\nbut the nachos are good. get those.", "author": "jessica l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-14", "description": "I don't mess around with Mexican food. I'm from California, I know a good burrito. NY has forced me to lower my standards and just accept that they just don't get it here, however I wasn't totally grossed out with my burrito. I just got the veggie burrito and for $7 and it did the job. I was hung over and just wanted something with substance. There wasn't much flavor but it wasn't terrible. Ya the guac was more of a paste but what can you do? I don't think I would attempt any of the meat but thats just me.
