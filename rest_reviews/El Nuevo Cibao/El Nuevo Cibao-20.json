Rice and beans = bland, Pernil was so dry. I actually went here off the reviews of the Pernil and it just wasn't all that so the reviews are now questionable to me. No skin just fat and dry meat.

Those reviews containing such superlatives as \"incredible\" or \"delicious\" make me seriously wonder about some diners' frames of reference. \nTHAT being said, there's a time and place for serviceable food--give or take MOST of the time. I certainly don't expect to have the socks knocked off my feet seven days a week for every one of the three meals I take in each day. That would definitely exhaust my limited supply of superlatives. So big shout out to all those purveyors of serviceable food: you make the world safe to appreciate incredibly delicious food!\nToday though, I was reminded at just how precious reasonably decent food can be when I was served my red snapper in spicy tomato sauce. Its picture appears below, and no, this was not some Cajun, blackened variation of snapper. After eating the first half of this whole fish, the top of which looked and tasted, well, decent enough, I flipped over to the other side only to discover this burnt concoction. I tasted it, and it tasted burnt. No doubt about it. \nThe coup de grace is that they had the AUDACITY to charge me $30 for this monstrosity. After a gentle protest the manager took off 5 bucks. Which should answer the question I know you're asking, \"so well the food is not so great, how is the service?\"", "author": "vladimir r."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "Came to this spot on a Saturday Searching for Spanish flavor food.

We nice simple but  tasteful ambiance.  We got seated shortly and were given toast.  Was good crunchy buttery toast. We almost bit full off it. \n\nOur dinner order:\nPernil mofogo- It was really good.  The sauce went perfect with the mofogo.\nOxtail stew- my dish- delish. Meat was tender and fell off the bones.  But it was a bit salty.  The sauteed mix veggies were a bit too greasy. Probably too much butter but taste good. \nPork chop with sauteed Mix veggies . Pork was tender and flavorful.  \n\nOverall service was good. We were taken care of.  Food was good and delish. No complaints but they were a bit on the salty side. The oxtail stew was a memorable one.

After reading the reviews, it's definitely true that they do not take credit cards, however, you could order through Yelp (Eat 24) or seamless and use your credit card that way. A little odd with that process, but bring cash if need be! Now onto the food. I ordered the pernil with maduros (sweet plaintains) and the boneless chicken chicharron. The pernil was just okay, a little dry on some parts, but maduros were great! The boneless chicken chicharron was great- full of flavor. I got this with rice and beans. The beans portion was very little so for this part, they could have included more. Other than that, I would give this place another shot.", "author": "Amy W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-26", "description": "Regular Spanish restaurant in Cobble Hill Carroll Gardens. I liked the food. It was um okay. Yayos in Parkslope is better. The reason why I give it one star is because of the service. \nI went the day after Christmas with my family to have dinner and the waitress was seriously terrible. It was 6 of us and she only gave us a wine bottle of tap water barely filled all of our cups half way. \nTakes our order. Food comes brings the food doesn't ask if we want anything else to drink or if we need anything else. She walked away so fast I had to call her back and tell her that we need more water and some drinks.\nOh and everyone got their food except my dad. She took his order but didn't place it  \nHonestly not a spot I would recommend to ANYONE.", "author": "Amanda C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-15", "description": "Interesting food adventure here.

The magoo though, that's on point (the handful of times I tried it) unfortunately the cheese is just a pool of oil (they could drain it before plating) and the salami/longaniza are ok but could be a whole lot better.

It has risen to the rank of our top Latin spot for lunch delivery as the previous place we ordered from seems to have totally fallen off the rails in terms of food quality. \n   I have been pretty happy with everything I have had so far. The baked ribs, chicken stew and Cuban sandwich. All of the lunch deals come with rice and beans (excellent beans btw) and the amount of food is quite impressive for the small 7.00 price tag. \n   The Cuban sandwich is whopping. Theres enough pork in there to make a second sandwich and the pork itself is lean and moist with lots of garlicky flavor. Not dry as in some places.  The ribs were also quite tender and had tons of flavor and the chicken stew on the bone was great. The delivery is fast considering they arent exactly around the block from us.

We walked in and it wasn't super busy being that it was July 4th weekend. Got a table immediately. The waitress was relatively new but friendly and accommodating. We ordered the tripe soup, Maduros, and pernil. First thing that came out was a basket of piping hot crunchy buttered bread! Yummo!! I always love places that bring you the warm bread! A for Effort! The tripe soup that came out was so tasty and good! It had chunks of tripe filed to the brim. There were also some pototoes in it. There was noticeably more tripe than potatoes. It was in a nice tomato based broth. Maduros came out not too greasy compared to other places I've had it. Sweet and gooey with a slight crispness from the caramelization. The pernil was fall off the bone yumminess. Definitely been in the oven for hours on hours end. The chicharron tasty and crunchy. Just as I like it. It came with some rice. We didn't even order much but we were so full we had to bring the rest of it home! Can't wait to have the leftovers. Cheap and good eats!

They didn't have potato salad which was kinda disappointing but everything else was great. For example the service was good and I guess my favorite thing to try was their toasted bread with melted butter on top. Woow their bread is extremely delicious and they give you bread like for appetizer and during your dinner which filled me up completely.
