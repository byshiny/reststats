Ive lived here for 5 years and most places are either overpriced or serves small portions. You can eat here for under 15 dollars and walk away feeling good about yourself.

The Hangover Helper juice was okay--it tasted a lot like pomegranate.  We were not pleased with our Tropical Rush or You're Soy Strong Smoothies.  \nI had the Greek Breakfast Wrap and thought it lacked flavor.  It was mostly egg white--very little tomato, onion or feta.  I had requested that spinach be added through Seamlessweb, but I won't fault them for that omission.  My companion had the Egg Sandwich and found it similarly bland.  I was cheered slightly by the inclusion of a slice of grapefruit.  \n\nBig ups for being on Seamlessweb, though.  I may give them another go since they have so many options on the menu.", "author": "Grace W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-30", "description": "Really some of the best food you could ask for for a catered event, especially for health conscious clients.", "author": "C.

It is really healthy and delicious.  It is pretty close to the train, like a 3-4 block walk from 4/5 train at borough hall.  I got a sun dried tomato wrap which was chicken and tasty caesar salad on the inside, basically.  I even got blue corn chips on the side.  It was so filling.  My fiancee got a soup and a smoothie and was also really satisfied.  They have numerous options(most of them healthy, some not so much).  You'll never get bored.  I recommend eating half and saving the other half for later.  I walked out, but I'm not sure how I made it.

I'm allergic to wheat,yeast,corn,soy,cow's milk, and egg whites. So I've explained that to the younger staff and they are understanding patient and nice. The only person on the staff that I have a problem with is this older waitress. I didn't get her name but she's the heavyset white spanish woman. Any way, everytime me and my fiance wait to be seated. She takes forever to get to our order, by conversing with other customers that already have their orders. And when I told her about my allergies, she was not so helpful,very inconsiderate and insensitive. We also didn't have clean glasses of water. And I feel like we might not go back there until that waitress is fired or spoken to. We also think that there should be more waiters and waitresses.

I suffer from an autoimmune disease and follow a very strict diet to avoid flare ups. I asked the workers at nature's grill twice whether or not their sweet potato fries have any additives( even mentioned that I have food allergies) and received assurance twice that they were 100% sweet potato. After I ate the fries, I immediately started to feel effects of an allergic reaction. My face is red and itchy, I have an upset stomach. Only after I asked for a third time, was I told that the fries are pre-processed, come in a bag and are coated with flour. In what world is a pre-processed French fry coated in flour healthy? The manager offered a free food voucher, as If I would ever consider eating somewhere that made me sick again. I now need to go out of my way to get a refund. If you are actually health conscious avoid this place. I'm paying the consequences for eating there right now and probably will be for the next couple of days.", "author": "D C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-09-06", "description": "I am thoroughly disappointed with the service of this establishment.  I called on the phone to order bacon and some other items to meet the minimum for delivery.   I didn't see it offered as a side item on the menu at GrubHub.com but they said they had it.  When I get my delivery I find out that its turkey bacon and has been charred almost black on the grill.  I would have been ok with turkey bacon but it tasted disgusting from the char.  When I called to ask for a refund I'm told since it is listed on the menu as turkey bacon under other items like a BLT (not directly specified) they won't refund.  However, after a few phone calls and actually going in person they finally relented and refunded the money for the bacon.\n\nI did try the other items I'd ordered.  Orange juice was good but that's hard to mess up, however, the salad was repulsive.  It contained cucumbers that were almost rotten and mushy.\n\nI do NOT recommend this restaurant.

(special Yelp offer) Not an awful experience, but nothing compelling about the place. Lots of other places to try before I'd return to this one.\n\nThis place deserves customer service props because even though the server didn't know about Yelp special \"mention Yelp for free 10oz smoothie\", she did call someone, and honored it even though it was supposed to be 4-6 only.\n\nPro- they were ok with my special order, (cheese instead of hummus, tortilla instead of pita). Counter staff friendly and competent, kudos for their attempt at being green (paper carton, unbleached napkins)\n\nWeird- Why so much meat on the menu? (more meet than veggie choices, even beef), why include a slice of grapefruit as garnish?\n\nBTW: I ordered lunch 2:30pm on a weekday.

Where else can a person who is watching their weight go out to eat guilt free?
