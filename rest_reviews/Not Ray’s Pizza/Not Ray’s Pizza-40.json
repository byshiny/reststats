If you are a New Yorker you know we have given definition and nostalgia to the word \"slice\", it has the same familiarity as \"fuggedaboudit\" and is used just as often, however we refer to the word \"slice\" as we go about ordering our pizza.\n\nNew Yorkers take their pizza seriously.  We fold our slice as meticulously as as we fold a crisp white shirt from the dryer. \n\nThe variety of pizza here is crazy. There's something for everyone.... seriously. It's a little pricey however as you bite into a mouth watering slice you will understand why one slice is almost $5.00 a piece.\n\nJust go.\n\nDon't look back.\n\nYou'll thank me later.\n\nTrust me.", "author": "Letty C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-06", "description": "Just ate one of there  meat slices little did i know that the slice was a double slice.i pick the slice wondering  why it was so heavy thought it was just the topppings of ham sausage,ground beef,pepperoni,  when i bit into it i realize  it was a slice with toppings on top of another slice with toppings Delicious  and filling.", "author": "Manuel H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-28", "description": "I've never been to Ray's, but I've been to Not Ray's aaaaand I like it.

The Fresh Mozzarella option is the ONLY slice I am talking about. Plain cheese = 2-3 stars).

Good pizza, in my humble opinion, has a thin but hearty crust, a substantial amount of tomato sauce, and enough cheese on top to keep the sauce in its place. This means that there's often enough cheese that there's a thin film of oil on top of each slice. Basically, if you want healthy pizza, make your own or go to some vegetarian spot. GREAT pizza is NOT that healthy, but it's DAMN GOOD. I've been going to Not Rays since I was a youngin and I've always been beyond happy to bite into each hot slice and savor a bit of oil running down my chin, or onto my arm.  They may charge nearly $3 for a slice, but it's well worth it. \n\nWhat it is: a great pizza spot that satisfies your craving for comforting, tasty pizza EVERY TIME. \n\nWhat it ain't: a fancy schmancy pretentious joint, charging you $$ for blah pizza.\n\nStop in and if you see me licking up oil offa my forearm, just smile and do the same.", "author": "Nelle C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-03", "description": "I've been here on numerous occasions.\nThe pizza's always good.

The first time I ordered from here I picked it because I thought the name was hilarious and it had good reviews. I expected good pizza but what was delivered even more delicious. I usually make my own pizzas. Such great crust and topping options. You can even add different toppings to the right and left sides all within seamless to make it easy. I definitely recommend this spot.", "author": "Tara P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-27", "description": "Just tried this place for the first time, it was decent but not earth-shattering.  The plain slice was pretty good all around, could've been in the oven a little longer to crisp up. The gramma slice was very good, and the gramma with pesto was excellent, I found the crust on the square pizza to be better than the round.  Nice customer service, a good place for a quick slice but not much more.", "author": "Sean L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "description": "If you want a no frills just straight up good slice of cheese pizza this is the spot.  The pizza taste exactly the same as when I was in HS and going to their spot when it was on the corner.

I've had the pepperoni and the margharita slices. when you walk by it you would think it's just your average nyc pizza spot but I found the options to be better and the pizza to taste fresher.

Simple homemade hand tossed pizza BY THE SLICE the way it should be.
