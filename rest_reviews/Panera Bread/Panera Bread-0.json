Easy to order via web/mobile and pick up or through the Panera kiosk if there is a line. \nStaff is friendly and doesn't take too long to pick up order except during the height of lunch at times. Dining inside - there is seating upstairs after you pick up your order. \n\nBagels are ok - tried many of them and still favor the cinnamon raisin and the cranberry walnut. This location you still can get preserves for free as Manhattan locations charges 50 cents plus tax.\n\nPastries have changed and gotten smaller - usually get the bear claw now since the pecan braid has shrunk.

Either it's a too long of a wait despite ordering ahead, food missing from my order or giving me the wrong food. \n\nThis is the last time I will order from Panera. Last week I ordered my usual salad, the Fuji apple chicken. I do make substitutions and have add ons that cost extra. In total my salad comes up to about $12. I go back to work to eat it and the bowl is half full and none of my add ons (which I paid extra for) are in the salad. I paid 12 bucks for a bowl of spinach greens.\n\nI tried to call and email customer service and as expected I did not get a response. So frustrating and disappointing, I will not return to this location. I'd rather go all the way to Union Square.", "author": "Keisha F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-03-11", "description": "I love Panera, I really really do. However, since moving to Brooklyn, I have not been impressed with this location at all. Today annoyed me enough to write a review.\n\nI ordered on the app (which is amazing by the way) at 1.11 and it said it would be ready at 1.21- great. I get there at 1.20 almost exactly and have to wait for another nearly ten minutes. It wasn't ready until 1.28. I ordered ahead for the sole purpose of not having to wait there because I only had a short break before my next class and I still had to wait for almost ten minutes.\n\nThe real kicker? I get to school and am now eating in the middle of class instead of before- and I find that there's no spoon. Not sure how I'm supposed to eat my soup now- or whoever checked this bag actually checked it. \n\nEveryone that works there always seems unpleasant and annoyed. I'm really not thrilled with this location at all.", "author": "Jordan M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-22", "description": "Always a great place to visit for breakfast. The floors are clean, and the place is well ventilated. My avocado egg white spinach sandwich is on the money every time. The service at the counter is pleasant and the person who give you your order takes the time to wish you \" a great day\". The price can be a little too much.

The food is good, there is a nice variety of items ranging from healthy to indulgent, and it always tastes good. You pick two (salad/sandwich/soup) is a good way to go because you can get a combo that's pretty filling. I usually order through the app and pick up for takeout and it's always been accurate and my food is fresh. On my last trip, I used a coupon which was great and I got another coupon for a future order.

Maybe it is the very definition of a franchise. This one on Adams Street in Brooklyn is shabby inside, with unattractive d\u00e9cor, and the carpeting upstairs is a triumph of hideousness; also, the upstairs room smells strongly of air freshener. \n\nOur green goddess salads were average. Surprisingly, Panera seems to have difficulty executing a serviceable baguette.

I ordered 1/2 turkey sandwich and 1/2 Thai chicken salad that came with a side for $10. Even though the place was busy due to the lunch rush, the woman that took my order was very patient with me as I picked my items. \n\nWhen I got back to work, I realized they forgot the chicken on my chicken salad. After a quick phone call, the manager told me I could come back in to get my whole meal free tomorrow due to the mix up. He was very friendly and very helpful in remedying the situation. When I went in today, everyone was equally as patient and friendly as yesterday even thought the spot was even busier with the lunch rush. \n\nI'll definitely be going back to this location for lunch.

But don't think that this particular location  would've gotten much more stars from me anyhow. The service is lackluster and the employees could care less. I go in this morning to order an oatmeal maybe wait about 5-10 mins for it and finally I see it being prepared. Imagine my surprise when I saw the young lady pull the oatmeal out of a microwaveable plastic  shove it in a cup and then try and give it to the other employee to make it. I thought this company stood on how fresh their products are. How SWAY ?? !
