I'm a fan of a more crunchy crust so the crust was a little soggy but the fresh Ingredients really made up for it.

Giant pizza labeled as a small.  Large (giant+) pizza for $26+.  Apparently you can have a half and a half (see others' reviews below), no one told us.  Seating is cramped.  You are decidedly not encouraged to do anything other than eat and leave.  Not a place for lingering over a small coffee.\n\nBasically, another internet famous place existing to quarantine the tourists so that they can't self-harm by walking the streets.\n\nThe calzone tastes like ricotta and green salad.  Pretty good ricotta, pretty good green salad, wasn't a hit.  The marinara is fine, but then there is the $18 price for it.\n\nThe wait... awful, awful wait for food that... let's say I just couldn't figure it out, would be fun if these reviews had an \"I live in NYC\" check box, I think that we were the only ones there, and that was because we had to.", "author": "telco h."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-23", "description": "I am happy to report that while DUMBO has not lived up to its promise of being another Soho, Juliana's and Grimaldi's on Front Street are still a big draw for tourists and city residents alike.\n\nJuliana's is next door to Grimaldi's.  What it lacks in size it makes up with its cozy feel, efficient service and, to boot, great pizza!  The Margherita pizza is a classic.  I think the tomato sauce is unmatched.  The bread doesn't seem to hold on to the heat very well, progressively getting harder to cut through as the meal progresses.  Juliana's also carries soups and salads, but unless you are a pie-hater or they (or you) run out of dough, you should get their pizza.  Note that the small is more than one person can comfortably finish, but the large is barely sufficient for two.  \n\nPatsy Grimaldi shows up from time to time.  But you will be struck more by the diversity of the diners here.  The pizza is certainly worth a 30 minute wait, in the same way that Di Fara is worth an hour's wait!", "author": "Srini V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-03", "description": "The best pizza in New York.

This was a treat back in the day and is just as delicious today. The location is the original Grimaldi's with the original oven and headed by none other than Patsy Grimaldi himself. \n\nWhat I love about Juliana's is the superior sauce on the pies. It is well balanced with the sweetest tomatoes with a hint of acidity, perfect consistency, and has the right amount of herbs; just as I remembered years ago. We always have to get a Margherita in the mix every time we come here ($19 large). The crust is perfectly cooked with a nice pull on the dough but lightly crisped on the edges. \n\nWe also decided to try some of the specialty pizzas. The No.1 ($30 large) is a quite decadent white pie with pancetta and truffle oil. The toppings just work very well together. The No. 2 ($29 large) is also a white pie where the fresh bufala mozzarella reigns true along with the fragrant garlic and small cherry tomatoes.\n\nMr. Patsy Grimaldi is also always around checking on the tables and asking how the food was. He's very welcoming and you can see how much he cares about his pizza. Tourists may head right over to his namesake on the corner but us real New Yorkers know to come to Juliana's for the real deal.", "author": "Denise W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-02", "description": "My fiance and I happened to be in Brooklyn for the Film Biz Recycling, and wanted to treat ourselves to some good old pizza, and we happened to find Juliana's on google as one of the top places in Brooklyn. We were a bit skeptical about the long wait, but went for it either way.\n\nOnce we got there ( no line whats so ever), who happens to open the door for us? None other than Mr. Patsy himself, we felt pretty cool at that very moment, he even seated us himself. Any restaurant where the owner is working all areas of the business seems pretty good to me. \n\nWe order the specialty pizza #1 , and it was to die for. Perfectly crisp, cheesy, and had an awesome fresh crispy flavor thanks to the scallions. It was over all one of the best pizza experiences I've ever had! My only one neg comment was my waiter. My fiance and i don;t drink so we did not order any wine, and we shared a large pie, this seemed to tick him off since our bill was not large. When I asked him for a glass of ice, he looked at me dum founded, \"like really your only spending 30 on a large pie and have the audacity to ask for ice!\"  \n\nNone the less we had a good experience and will def return!", "author": "Jersey G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "My girlfriends and I were in NYC for a little vacay and getting some good old NY pizza was on the top of our list. Juliana's was the perfect place to check that off our list! Their pizza is phenomenal. I think most people know that this place is owned by the same man who opened up Grimaldi's next door, but I'm just saying it again anyway.\n\nHe was at the restaurant the night we came in--such a sweet guy! He was talking to diners and really helping run the busy dinner rush. They don't take reservations so show up a little before the dinner time to avoid a long wait. They were incredibly quick with getting us seated and having our orders in even on a busy Friday night. Service was great and no complaints there.\n\nOn to the foood! We tried the Margherita pizza and the salmon pizza (No.5 off their specials). The Margherita pizza was awesome, definitely did not disappoint. The sauce is amazing and just the right amount of cheese on a flavorful thin crust. If you can't decide what to get, do yourself a favor and get this one.\n\nWe also tried he salmon pizza which was ...interesting. It's topped with smoked salmon, goat cheese, capers aka a lox bagel in pizza form. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either. Maybe it needed a sauce to bring it all together and actually feel like pizza. \n\nDefinitely check out this place if you're in Brooklyn!", "author": "Renu A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "The wait is ridiculous.

He assured us he would make them wait. Then as I walk in to check that their not taking seats, the employee try to explain that \"they are regulars\". Which is total BS! The guy was just waving down for 2 seats, he had no clue who they are.\n\nYou know i must be really mistreated to make a full post and report.

Check below to see why. \n\nThe space here is beautiful, really well laid out and designed. The service is impeccable, really quite impressive. This is fancy pizza, no slices and garlic knots here. They do have a menu beyond pizza but pizza dominates. Small pizzas are $16-24 while larges are $19-27. It's definitely one of the more expensive pizzas you'll find in the city. I personally didn't find it to be worth the price.\n\nI split a classic margherita. The very middle of the pizza was dry as a bone (no sauce, cheese, or oil). On the plus side the tomato sauce was fresh and vibrant and the mozerella was smooth and stretchy. It was evident that they use ultra fresh ingredients. They were a tad stingy on the basil and put it on a little too early but it wasn't too bad. Crust was crispy and not too thin or thick, it was a tad dry though. I was eyeballing other couples' pizzas and I think going with something with more toppings is the way to go here. It's surpising that I remember having a better pizza at the fake Grimaldi's then the real one. Let me explain:\n\nAround 1941 Patsy Grimaldi (nephew of Pasquale \"Patsy\" Lancieri, owner of Patsy's and apprentice to Gennaro Lombardi, originator of pizza in the US in 1905) trained under his uncle and learned Lombardi's secrets and later in 1990 opened Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn. In 1998 he sold that business to Frank Ciolli. In 2012, Frank Ciolli was forced to move the ultra popular Grimaldi's next door due to rent disputes. Patsy Grimaldi came out of retirement and snatched up his old storefront to open Juliana's, a pizza place named after his late mother.", "author": "Matt E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-30", "description": "Loved the pizza \nLoved my Brookie bridge\nThe waiter too\nI watched them make the pizza and I saw the freshest ingredients \nLoved the decor\nWish we could eat here again", "author": "Christina W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "If you're reading this you probably already know about the feud.

If you don't want to wait, you can call in your order and there are plenty of spots to sit and take in the skyline view of lower Manhattan while you enjoy an amazing pie. You will eat too much.
