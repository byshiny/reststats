I went here for brunch and it was a bit more expensive than I wanted it to be, but it was worth it in the end. I ordered a burger cooked medium rare with fries and added goat cheese for an extra dollar, such a good choice. The burger was cooked perfect, rarely do I go to a restaurant and the burger is in fact cooked a true medium rare, this was. I also ordered a mimosa, they did not skimp on the alcohol at all, hells yes. Another note all the workers were fairly friendly even though they were a full house. I'll have to make another trip here, I mean I do live about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance, so I might as well.", "author": "Rosemarie H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-22", "description": "Holy McGoogle-pants! This place is just perfect. Superbly delicious food, very small menu (which means everything on it is good), and a charming-as-hell-atmosphere.

Very convenient to BAM and the other downtown Brooklyn sites. They were out of rilettes so I had a pate, which was pretty good and my companion had a kale salad. Mains were a tagliatelle puttanesca, and a very tasty stuffed tomatoes with rice; the rice was cooked in butter and was delicious and the tomatoes were stuffed with spicy sausage. Dessert was creme brule with fruit.\nEspresso is available and was good. This is more of a bar with snacks than a restaurant and the menu is quite limited, but good.", "author": "james h."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-05", "description": "Bad review based on a 4 dollar iced coffee that was both small(12 ounces) and tasted mostly like water. \n\nPretentious atmosphere does not guarantee  quality.", "author": "John S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-12", "description": "Awesome little spot! New to the neighborhood, so my boyfriend and I wanted a nice brunch spot nearby. Called and they were happy to take a reservation for three people despite the small space (maybe room for 30 people). I had the burger, which was done just right and had a lovely aioli on it. Boyfriend had the avocado and egg toast, while our friend had the gravlax club. All solid choices.

I experienced a form of discrimination by one of their waitresses . As I was told to move to another area so that any other family can take my seating. I didn't understand what was the problem then I was advised by the same person that their restaurant may not have been what I wanted and was told I could go somewhere else because I asked if they had something else other than crepes. My friend and I decided to leave because we were obviously not being welcomed . I am not sure if it was because we didn't look French . I am a dark skin Hispanic and my friend Asian or the fact that we probably didn't fit the profile of their usual European primarily white customers but it was awkward and humiliating and will never go there again and want to warn those like myself colored ,Hispanics , and Asians to beware and don't spend you time and money on this place!!", "author": "Wanda A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-09", "description": "This is a terrific find and is close enough to BAM to be an excellent before-performance dining option.

I've been walking by it for months, and have eaten dinner and brunch there, had a few drinks on New Year's eve, and even stopped by just for coffee.  I'd definitely recommend their dinner service:  the radishes with butter were so delicious, and everything we ordered (plate after plate) was really fantastic.  My boyfriend is French and enjoyed speaking with the owner, who also sold us a really nice bottle of wine for a deep discount.  I had a creamy, cheesy cauliflower soup (the soup of the day) which was perfect.  The brunch was not as good as dinner.  My croque-monsieur needed more cheese, and to be cooked more, the cheese that was on it wasn't melted (a pet peeve).  The French press also tasted really off...but on the other hand, their pan perdu/french toast was extremely good, and the prices are pretty good for Brooklyn/Fort Greene.
