(posted on the 15th)\nYou are not crazy!!!  My wife and I  bought a dozen bagels this past Friday, under the allure of a \"buy $10 worth of Boarshead and get a dozen bagels free!\"\nWe were like, Awesome! What a deal!\n.... until we actually tasted few of these funky bagels...\nThe flavor is so strange and unsettling - we were't able to put our finger on it right away. But we feel like it might be connected to the water they boiled them in?? They have a strong metallic/mildew flavor. Really. Really off-putting. You take a bite, and your body is like, \" I am NOT suppose to be eating this.\" \nWhat I once thought was a GREAT deal to get rid of afternoon bagels - I now see as completely dishonest. There is something seriously wrong with these bagels. They should have thrown them out - not tricked us into buying meat in order to pawn these  mildew flavored bagels off on us.", "author": "Ryan J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-20", "description": "Small bagel chains seem to be branching out more and more. No problem with that if they can keep a consistently good product. Not sure what the \"La\" is for in the not-completely-translated namesake but  who cares? This is one good bagel.\n\nThis location out of 5 is not that far from most of the courthouses in downtown Brooklyn if you are up for a little bit of a walk. The tiny place was bustling with activity with two separate lines forming at opposite ends of each other. I went for an everything bagel with cheddar \u0026 jalapeno cream cheese. The bagel was fresh, warm, and soft but could have used a bit more toppings. They really plopped on the cream cheese and it was pretty tasty despite being a bit overwhelming. They had a large variety of cream cheeses like all good bagel places should have. All in all, it made for a very decent bagel. They have other hot foods and sandwiches here but they are a bit sparse with the seating I noticed. Not sure if they had a bathroom. I've been to the one not too far away on Lafayette in Fort Greene and that seemed to offer more frills, if I'm not mistaken.\n\nThis place is worth the trip if you are in the area and are looking for your standard NYC bagel without too many complaints. What would NYC be without any complainers? I guess we would only have acceptable and barely passable bagels.

The difference between a bagel 2 hours out of the oven and one 20 minutes out of the even is totally remarkable at this place.  Neither bagel is Ess-A-Bagel, but the former is much less worth eating than the latter.", "author": "Raffi M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-10", "description": "I may lose my NY cred for this if I have any left, but Bagel Delight has some of thebest bagels in the city, 2nd only to Essa IMHO. \n\nThe bagels have the perfect blend of chewiness and mass, and the everything bagel is like a party in my mouth and then some. The veggie cream cheese is delicious, and the staff is very efficient and friendly. I'm never left standing around scratching myself waiting for my order. \n\nThe coffee is mediocre and inconsistent, which makes the store lose a star. \n\nAll in all great though.", "author": "Jamie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-05-19", "description": "What is it with brooklyn restaurants recently and the horrible service? Ever hear of the customer (especially returning customer) is always right??I've been going to this place since moving here a year ago and no complaints, bagels have always been decent, prices are average. I occasionally swing by for a sandwich on days where I am working from home. Ordered a standard turkey + cheese wrap and went to pay for that + drink + chips. Order came out to almost $20! I told them, there must be something wrong no way is this $20. The airhead working the register looked at the guy who made my wrap like I was speaking some foreign language. He proceeds to print out the receipt and i notice 4 items on the bill. I tell him i just got the 3 (wrap, drink, chips)..He asks me if i got turkey with cheese, i say yes. Finally figures out that he put some other shmucks turkey + cheese sandwich and my wrap in the same bag. Wouldnt have been a problem if they didnt give me an attitude and act like I screwed up. Asked for a receipt and suddenly their machine doesnt work and they cant provide me one. \n\nSorry la bagel, our relationship is done. Ill go to one of a million other places that has the same food without the lousy attitude.", "author": "Greg L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-20", "description": "I've been here about a dozen times while visiting my sister in law in the city and they never fail. This is my go to place for cheap, delicious morning eats. \n\nI'm a lox snob so I hesitated to try it here, but I'm glad that I did. It had a great smokey, meaty flavor. Try it with scallion or plain spread on a toasted onion bagel. So good!\n\nThe lox spread is also top notch - big pieces of lox and not goopy or made from old scraps. \n\nThe bagels are also very good, maybe not the best I've had in my life, but they still hit all of the high points for good bagels: flavorful and chewy with a good crunch when you bite through.", "author": "Andrew G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "I ordered a lox special and my friend got an everything bagel.

I didn't enjoy the sandwich as much as I thought I would, but gave la bagel a second shot.\n\nThe second time around I went and got a turkey melt. It was delicious!

Yeah, the folks who established this LBD* have that figured that out in spades because this place is making a killing -- it's the only bagel store near the burgeoning DoBro neighborhood (containing the Brooklyner, Avalon and a ton of new condos).

Fresh bagels are like crack in that way.\n\nThat said, if you've been to one LBD, this one won't surprise you -- it's consistently good with solid cream cheese choices (including a plethora of little smiley faces on each of the cream cheese tags) as well as a full-service sandwich line. They'll even cook you eggs, sausage, bacon, etc. to put on your bagel in the morning.\n\nIt's packed in the morning due to its' proximity to the courthouse, but they move through the line pretty quickly.\n\n* - I'm with peter d. on the whole naming thing -- why do we need the La there?

I know what you're thinking ... \"If you want flavor get a whole egg, you bum!\" But when you get two egg whites with TURKEY on a ONION BAGEL you expect flavor to shine through regardless if the egg whites are a bit bland.
