Nothing phenomenal. I particularly had an issue with the sauce - it could use a little more flavor. No doubt that the food tasted fresh and the crust was thin and crispy, but I guess I was expecting a lot more. I'd prefer the Prince St. Pizza over this.", "author": "Henna S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-07", "description": "Pizza is so delicious, so flavorful, so filling.

Great service and quality ingredients. Ordered the No. 1 and enjoyed the smoked cheese with scallions, but we weren't able to taste the white truffle at all. Unsure if it was overpowered by the pancetta?", "author": "Priya C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-29", "description": "Came with my boyfriend. We went for the Dumbo Art Festival and as you can imagine, the line was very long. We've waited for almost one hour to eat pizza....Unbelievable. We turned super hungry when finally got in. Ordered the No.1 (maybe?) pizza with Bacon, Cheese, and Scallion. The pizza was super yummy... We also ate dessert in the end - a mixture of brownie and cookie - also not bad.", "author": "Yuqing L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-22", "description": "We stopped at Juliana's based on the yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  The margarita pizza was excellent.  I can't get over how wonderful the sauce is.  We wanted to have a slice at Juliana's and grimaldi's next door but both only sell whole pies.  So we decided to get whole pies:). We literally sat down with a whole pie at Juliana's had a couple slices and went next door for another whole pie.  I have to say that while lacking in ambience at Juliana's it won in every other category.  Best flavor, best crust, best service, best, best, best.", "author": "Gena L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-05", "description": "I did a taste test between Julianna's and Grimaldi's tonight. The verdict: Julianna's is better than Grimaldi's. Not by much (the pizzas are very similar), but by enough. The seasoning was the big thing for me---Julianna's simply does it better. I also thought the dough in Grimaldi's was slightly undercooked (a bit doughy), whereas Julianna's was just right.", "author": "Sam M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-08", "description": "i expected better after reading the reviews.  \nApparently Juliana's Pizza was started by the originators of the Grimaldi's chain pizza.  Might as well go to Grimaldi's.  We are from Phoenix and wanted to support local vs a chain, but it was basically the same product with more restrictions.  To get a basic pepperoni, we had to order a margarita pizza and add pepperoni.  I love margarita pizza, cause BAISL! But there were only about 9 leaf's of wilted basil for a large pizza.  \nMy bf and I were sat against a wall and were blocked in with another two person table less than 4 inches away from us.  To use the bathroom and leave, the people next to us, were forced to get up to let us out.  Our order was placed, received, and removed by reaching over and around the poor couple beside us.\nWe twice had to ask for water refills.  When pouring, the waiter poured into my glass while I held it, while condensation dripped off the pitcher onto the back of guy behind us.  \nAnd the bathroom smelled strongly of  urine: absolutely disgusting, and it is right next to were they pounding out the dough.\nWouldn't be hard to find a better meal for $50.  (we also got a beer each. best part of the meal.)", "author": "Erin W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-30", "description": "It was amazing! I don't know how you tell what's the best pizza in the country, but trip advisor wasn't far off with its rating of this pizza place. The line was long but it was worth the wait.

I arrived last night and yes the place is busy. We waited 25 minutes outside and 10 minutes to place our order. We sat down with another couple and ordered the exact same pizza! They were served immediately and we waited, waited and waited and watched everyone around us eat. I asked our server twice what was going on, but he was too busy for us. WE JUST WALKED OUT.

What made the restaurant was the great service. Everyone from the host, the staff and manager were very friendly, accommodating and just made the visit nice.

I am from NJ and love a thin, crisp crust.  This crust was thin... but soggy.  Could not hold the weight of the skimpy toppings.  Suggestion... possibly, get it to go and re-heat in oven at home to get the crust nice and crisp.
