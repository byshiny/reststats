(it wasn't.  it was delicate and delicious and unlike anything else i've ever tasted).\n\ni came here specifically for the wild game menu.  i tell ya what, the rumors are true.  it is completely mind blowing.  the meat--- OH THE MEAT!!  the mixed game grill came to the table with a trio of things i'd never even considered eating but now that i'd seen it on a menu, was ITCHING to try.  by far, the elk chop was the table favorite.  tender, savory, fragrant.  so good, we unanimously agreed to dispense with etiquette (and silverware) to gnaw the bones clean.\n\n2nd best was the braised boar belly -- the most delicious bacon-like substance i've ever tasted.  crispy on the outside and perfect!  no wait, i take it back... 2nd best was the venison sausage! Spicy and juicy.  or wait... maybe the boar stew.... \n\nAh, forget it.  i don't even have the verbal capacity to describe everything that found their way into our tummies.  it was all outstanding.\n\naccompanying each entree was a side dish containing the least amount of items that could be combined on one plate and still be referred to as a \"dish\" -- two forkfuls of rice, a bite each of cauliflower and carrot, and a singular, halved, brussels sprout.  fine by me.   after all, i came for the meat.  the less distractions, the better, in my opinion.\n\nwe heard rattlesnake and kangaroo will be featured before the festival ends -- i'm already planning my repeat appearance.", "author": "Mag M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-03", "description": "I found Henry's End accidentally, trying to find a good restaurant to visit with my parents.  If I lived in Brooklyn Heights, I'd eat here once a week!  Despite the wild game menu that everyone raves about, I usually get their salmon.  Whether it's salmon with lentils, salmon crusted with crabmeat, or their salmon moroccan (my husband's favorite,) it's always perfect!  Their weeknight prix fixe menu is better than any deal you'll score during restaurant week -- $25 for three courses, and well worth it.  Their persian lime pie is a great way to end the night.  In addition to their fantastic menu, one of the best parts of Henry's End is the staff -- always welcoming, friendly, and accommodating.

Their beet and warm goat cheese salad is incredible - I order it every time I go.  Right now, they've got a pear-raspberry soup on the appetizer menu that is divinely creamy and full-bodied - do they put butter in it or something?  Can you do that to fruit soups?  I don't know, but it's amazing.  Artichoke and lemon soup?  Check.  They do lovely seasonal vegetable sides sometimes too - this spring, they had fiddlehead ferns.  They've got a wonderful pesto, and their roasted vegetables over polenta are supreme.  And, of course, the wonderful desserts are all veg-friendly - get the Mr. or Mrs. Mud Pie - HUGE slices of ice-cream based cookie-crust pies.  Top it off with an espresso - beautiful.\n\nSo vegetarians - do you have a beloved carnivore eager to try Henry's End?

Nothing pretentious about it, and the motherly waitress whos name escapes me is always there to please.\n\nWhat rules about this place is their fall/winter wild game menu, they call it their wild game festival i believe.\n\nVery well priced wine menu, with a chalkboard for specials by the glass every night.  \n\nUnless I'm mistaken the current chef owner was a dishwasher their a long time ago and worked his way up.

The minimal waiting time was enhanced by the helpful and genuine attentiveness from the staffer who updated us with wait times upon finding out that the table we were waiting for had not ordered dessert.  All that said, the food was so good, that even an hour long wait would probably have been worth it.\n\nWe started off with the wild mushroom salad from the regular menu and a special app of the shaved brussel sprouts, bacon, pecorino \u0026 pomegranate salad.  Each selection was perfectly on point.  The wild mushroom salad was warm and rich and garlicky (though BF thought perhaps a little too much oil with that garlic).  The brussel sprout salad was well prepared, to appear like a frisee, and had delicate, well-complimenting flavors - from the smokey bacon pieces to the sweet fresh crunch of the pomegranate seeds. \n\nFor mains, we both decided to sample the wild game menu, which has been extended to continue until Memorial Day.  BF tried the wild game sampler platter, which included rabbit sausage, elk chops with a mustard seed breadcrumb crust and wild boar belly with pomegranate pistachio chutney.  The lowest point for him was the rabbit sausage, which he expected, saying he did not order for the sausage, and felt it simply tasted like any other good sausage.  The pork belly was reported as pig 2.0, with a perfect combination of fat and sweetness in the meat, enhanced by the flavors in the sauce.  The elk chops were the star of his plate, and is being coined as one of his new favorite meals.  The meat was tender and perfectly cooked and didn't fall into any trap of being typically too gamey.  I went with the penne with venison sausage, butternut squash and hazelnut.  Perhaps it was a safe choice in the realm of wild game, but it was still delicious enough to not care.  The sausage was spicy and sweet simultaneously and the sweetness of the squash highlighted that hint of sweetness in the meat, while the hazelnut added a bonus crunch and richness to the dish.  \n\nThe service was pleasant, attentive and yet unobtrusive throughout our meal.  The atmosphere is warm, cozy, and food-focused without being stuffy in the least.

If you don't, this probably isn't for you.  Cozy, small, intimate.  The kind of place that doesn't have to pretend about anything.  Great wine list, and attentive, unannoying staff (sime might mistake this for snootiness, but I never liked a server saying, \"Hi, I;m Amber and I'll be taking care of you tonight...\").  Yes, the desert choices are skimpy, but you don't come here for desert.

We came during the week and took advantage of the price fixed menu (M-TH). Service was fantastic, the food was even better. I think the appetizers were the highlight of the meal. I had macadamia nut crusted shrimp in a peanut sauce with some kind of apple/pineapple/cranberry mash, and he had braised short ribs in a wonderful BBQ sauce.

We were totally fine with this, since they don't have a bar, and they came and got us very quickly. So we started off well..\n\nThe food, service and management was great. We all got different things and loved all of them. My dad and BF tried different wild game entrees and we're so impressed, while my mom, my sister, and I keep it basic, but still loved it none-the-less. The waitress was super nice, always attentive and put up with my dad's \"dad jokes\" (we all know what thats like). The manager or owner was very nice too, he was the one who came and got us from the wine bar, called us a cab after our meal (yes, suburbanite parents refuse to walk a few blocks) and was overall, very accommodating. \n\nI would definitely come back here.

Yes, the menu is a mecca of game and interesting meat.  The wine list is excellent, with several big, bold fruity wines and smoother New World wines.  I had a terrific mustard-crusted tuna steak that was perfectly medium rare with a crusty, crunchy coating of stone-ground mustard.  They used pan juices, wine and more mustard to reduce down an intense and thick mustard sauce.  It was lying on perfectly steamed bed of fresh spinach with soy and mustard oil.  It was just excellent.  The waitress was fantastic, friendly and using terms of endearment and she is absolutely Julia Child's doppelganger. No kidding.  That unique side-of-the-mouth diction as well.  The dessert of layered crepes with custard was velvety and light.  The only weak point was the espresso.

There was no Wild Game plate that day, so my bf and I ordered the dinner combo. \nMy appetizer corn calamari patty was a bit too salty. but the sauce came with it was creamy enough to tone down it a bit. My rib was cooked very well. It melt right away in my mouth, but it was also a bit heavy on the sourness. Again, it is an appetizer, so the acidity wasn't that big of a problem here. and it help to tone down the fattiness of the meat. \nMain courses were Soft shell crab, veal (forgot the long name) it came with a very creamy sauce with some diced tomato. i thought it was pork first, since the way it was prepared was deep fried with coated flour, then simmered with the sauce afterward. It made the texture of the meat taste more like pork. it was a okay dish. Not bad but not wahhh ~\nMy bf's plate (soft shell crab) on the other hand was so delicious, the seasoning was just right. Not too salty and very savory. Americans don't cook with MSG or Chicken Essence Powder often. The savory of this dish came from the freshness of the raw material ( crab). The only thing is i wish there were some vegetables on the side. \ndessert were okay okay. Again, this is not a bakery or a dessert hot spot. Mine was meshed banana with whip cream on the top. Maybe they know it is lacked on texture, it was top with few crispy granola. but it was still too muddy. Almost like a warm banana smoothie... :( The whole experience was average.

With this in mind, and the rather poor air conditioning on a blistering evening, I was pleased by the friendly service and delicious food.
