I'm there, Especially when it claims to be the best!  It's absolutely my favorite type of cake.  So when I saw Juniors featured in my Lonely Planet book, I made it my mission to go.  I walked the Brooklyn Bridge and enjoyed a walking tour from my book and ended this adventure with a slice of cake from Juniors.\n\n[The Cake]\n\nI ordered a traditional slice of cheesecake.  Very good!  It was simple yet splendid in flavor.  The cake was not overwhelming in favor and had a thick and smooth texture.   I was pleasantly surprised because I had expected a super sweet cheesecake like the Cheesecake Factory.     This cheesecake is perhaps one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had...only coming second to my very own cheesecake. ;)", "author": "Brandi G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-09", "description": "I stick to the cheesecake here haven't tried any of the dishes so can't comment on it.

Cheesecake is one of my favorite cakes to eat, but the ones I've tried from this place, at locations in BK and the city, tasted like mud and were just so heavy. It was extremely overpriced to boot.

I have personally visited the Brooklyn site, and even ordered online cheesecakes as gifts for friends in other parts of the USA.   The Cakes arrive frozen in pristine perfect shape, and you defrost them.  \n\nThe strawberry cheesecake is my favorite with gargantuan sized strawberries, the largest you will ever see.   They have many other exotic cakes and cheesecakes you can order too online.  \n\nDon't take my word, check it out for yourself.  ;)", "author": "Michael W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-25", "description": "Best Ginger Thai wings ever!

It was busy but the food was banging and the service was phenomenol. Its really some of the best cheesecake I've ever had in my life-not that I've had too many but it was a good time.

We got the sampler - plain, cherry, raspberry, chocolate - I have actually only tried the cherry so far, but it is definitely the best cheesecake I have ever had. So creamy and light - but still dense - all around amazing\n\nCheesecake lovers - this is a MUST try.

Cheesecake was awesome (recommending Choc Mousse and Strawberry Shortcake versions).  The meals were really good and I'd recommend the southern fried chicken breast ... burgers ... mini brioche pastrami sandwiches.  The restaurant has flashback appeal to it which is aided by the pic of famous stars from years ago, and the great music they play from the Motown era.  For me, eating here was like eating at home ... and when you're on the road as much as I am that is a very good thing.", "author": "D A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-01", "description": "Did not disappoint, have not been here for 30 years.

Yummy comfort food, service is always great, AND this is the original location. Don't fall for the locations in the city and elsewhere because they're overpriced clones without the same quality of food and service. Best part is definitely the cheesecake. One slice can be a meal on its own. I also drop in for individual pies for birthdays and other special occasions.

As an added bonus, Junior's also serves good deli food.  I went there a few days ago after a long hiatus and noticed their prices have increased substantially - but the food \u0026 service were as good as ever and the interior still looks great.

There's something totally authentic feeling about Junior's - the 1950s music, the drugstore seasonal decor - that would feel kitschy or silly anywhere else. The food is great, refills are free, and the pickle plates are endless, but it's the full experience that makes this a five-star restaurant.", "author": "Michelle M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-07", "description": "ok all I tried was the original cheesecake\n\nand it was like HEAVEN, it has been by far one of the most delicious cheesecakes I have ever tasted!\n\nI do not know if I can look at other cheesecake the same since this was soo good.\n\nI have to admit I was skeptical because I like my cheesecake with a thick crust, and Junior cheesecake did not have this but the creaminess was all worth it!", "author": "Liz S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-14", "description": "I love their Traditional CHEESECAKE.
