WORTH THE WAIT!  And compared to Grimaldi's THIS is the way better pizza.  In fact there's no comparison, really.  We had the basic Margherita pizza which was served up pretty quickly but a very friendly server (hostess was really nice too).  The crust was crunchy and the cheese was FRESH with basil and just enough sauce.\n\nWe also split a plate of pasta with meatballs.  Also delicious.\n\nThe restaurant itself was clean and tidy. Nice decor.\n\nI think this is the best.

Authentic coal fired New York inspired pizza, it is worth the trek into Brooklyn. It is right on the water by the harbor, ferris wheel, in front of both the bridges. I like the DUMBO area quite a bit, because you can smell the air from the East River, and see boats go by. The view of Manhattan from there is really spectacular at night, it sparkles and you can really observe the density of the city. A friend met me down here after a book signing and we talked on the Greenway and then walked up the street to find this lovely place. It is just as cool inside as out, with traditional title, and fast service. I would recommend it to anyone in the area who wants a hot pie, classic crust, and fresh ingredients. I encourage you to make a night of it, stroll on the pier, get ice cream. It is a very romantic destination.", "author": "Destiny R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-08", "description": "So my beautiful date and I were craving pizza and originally planned to check out Grimaldi's in DUMBO. Then we spotted this place and saw an even longer line. Thanks to the good graces of Yelp, we decided to check out Juliana's Pizza! We truly made a smart move! Another family run joint by Patsy Grimaldi, this place was soooooooooooo worth the wait! We ordered one of their pizza specialities (has pancetta, mozzarella cheese, arugula, drizzled olive oil, and something I'm forgetting), but it was pure heaven from the first bite!

It was fine, but it wasn't anything great.    We also had a spinach salad, which was also just fine fine; nothing special.  I liked the IPA they had on tap, but the pizza was just A-OK and the salad was a meh.\n\nAlso, of disappointment was that we said we wanted to add mushrooms to the #3.   They said NO --- you can't add any toppings to our specialty pizzas.   This is ridiculous especially when they offer it as a topping on build your own pizzas..    \n\nEven more ridiculous is the following:  the table next to us was custom building a pizza (choosing all their own toppings), and she said they wanted spinach as a topping; the customers were told that they don't have a spinach topping, at which point the customer pointed to our table and said \"they have a huge spinach salad in front of them; was that the last of the spinach?\"  To which the waiter responded:  \"All of the spinach we have is for salads only.\"\n\nThese people are ridiculous.  They have mushrooms, but you can only put it on a pizza built from scratch; you can't add it to one of their specialty pizzas even if you are willing to pay for it.   They have spinach, but you can't get that on any pizza even if you are willing to pay for it.      After a 20-25 minute wait for us to be seated, and just A-OK pizza, this is dropping them from what would have been 3 stars to 2 stars due to the lack of flexibility by the restaurant with respect to toppings.", "author": "Marc P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-23", "description": "Outstanding pie.

I could taste every fresh ingredient and I loved that I could watch the chefs make the pizzas from my table. Everyone was super friendly with a smile and our waiter was fantastic! We walked the Brooklyn Bridge over to Dumbo and really enjoyed this delicious pizza! Toppings we chose: Margherita sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage with fennel and prosciutto.

You will be rewarded with the best pizza you have ever tasted., It only took us 30 minutes to get seated, and its clear they try to get you seated as soon as they can.  We did a half and half pizza, one half margarita with peperoni and sausage, and the other a white cheese pie with pepperoni and sausage. If you are with another hungry person, I suggest the large pie, not the small.

I thought about this as I dug into the #1 special here. We sat at the counter where we could see the pizza being made so we saw firsthand the mounds of fresh mozzarella, meat and vegs that go into pies here. And yet, our pie would've been all but tasteless except for the toppings. Eventually we asked for a side of tomato sauce to spread on our pizza, and that made all the difference. The sauce is amazing btw, and the 2 of us finished our large pie, thanks in no small part to the sauce.\n\nWe waited about 30-35 mins starting at 6 on a lovely Saturday evening.

I went with a group of 4, and we ordered a small No. 3 \u0026 No. 4.\n\nThey were both really good! We were afraid they were going to taste similar, but they were quite different. No. 3 was a white pizza with mozzarella, sausage, broccoli rabe, and sausage. The cheese was gooey and all of the toppings worked well together. I threw on red pepper flakes and I thought it balanced out the flavors well. No. 4 had arugula, tomato, mozzarella, and prosciutto. Delicious as well, but it was a little harder to eat as the prosciutto and arugula made it challenging. It was hard for us to decide which one we liked better, but 3 of us chose No. 3 over 4. I would say it really depends on your preference though.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Brookie Bridge. It was a brownie ice cream sandwich. There were several ice cream flavors that were available, but we got pistachio ice cream. Overall, it was pretty good. A little rich but not toooo sweet. Brownie overpowered the ice cream as I couldn't taste the pistachio. Would recommend getting vanilla ice cream with it. \n\nService was great. Our server was quick and prompt. When we ordered the drinks and food, the wait was not long at all. \n\nI would suggest trying this place as soon as they open.
