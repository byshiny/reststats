This place was unbelievably boring. The music was sub par at best and the manager was rude. Last time I checked the customers make the business, you can't make money if ppl don't like your establishment. I don't get how the manager thought he could cut in front of me for the bathroom, and got mad at me because I stopped him.

I was always impressed by the eclectic mix of people that it attracted- artists, business people, hipsters and thugs. Welcome to Brooklyn! Shift in ownership , changed staff, a few renovations, yadda, yadda, yadda...and now we're at Mo's without the e. \n\nThe first time I went after the new Mo's first opened the bartender told me about the pricing structure which was based on the shelf level that the alcohol bottle was on...except for bottles on the end of the last shelf that had a separate, higher price. \"So you basically just nullified, the shelf  levels = pricing tier thing\". Kinda made no sense to me. I suggested- if this tier system is so important, build a 4th shelf and create a 4th tier rather than getting frustrated when a customer asks why their drink price from the 3rd shelf doesn't match any of the tiers that you just spent time talking about. This totally left a bad taste in my mouth, so I was happy to see that references to the tiers are now completely gone when I returned last night. Thanks- it didn't make sense anyway. \n\nThis last time, I came on a Saturday and the crowd wasn't too heavy or light. It was easy to breath and if you hung out for a bit, you'd definitely get a seat. The drinks are always good and the bartenders are pretty nice. There was a DJ on and lots of dancing in the upstairs part, but the volume was not overwhelming in the front, so it was easy to hold a conversation. Just be sure that if you come, you bring cash. No credit cards here kids. There is an ATM conveniently placed right outside though.", "author": "Nyota W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-29", "description": "I've been coming to MO's since I was about 19 years old. I've been an avid \"MO's goer,\"spending almost every weekend there because I loved the atmosphere.Ever since the change in management and staff the customer service has been unprofessional and aggressive. I recently visited with a group of my friends as had an unpleasant experience. The seat that i was sitting in was too low. There was an available chair adjacent to where I sitting, I decided to move it over and use it. Although I understand that some establishments like to keep their set up a certain way I still thought it was ok to move. A si have been coming here for years and have seen this done on multiple occasions. A man walks up behind me as I'm sitting and says \"did the chair look like it needed or could have been moved.\" He never addressed me or identified hisself. I look at him and replied saying I didnt know it was a problem, then I proceeded to move the chair back. As I was moving it he said \" oh no, it's fine you can leave it there. I just continued to move the chair back, he aggressively grabbed the chair and said I'll move it in the manager. Now I know I was in the wrong for moving the chair without asking however he could have walked over to me, addressed me and nicely explained the policy. I would have been more than obliged to move the chair back. It just wasn't a good experience and will be my last.", "author": "Nafeesa J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "Venues like Mo's always try to do too much. \n\nMy first visit to Mo's was so cool and chill. I ignored the cheesy Hennesy based cocktail menu and enjoyed the nostalgic 80's and 90s R\u0026B/Hip-Hop music. The couches were comfy and I could have easily ended my night there.\n\nHowever, on my second visit they played a game and the place was loud and crowded like a sports bar.

One of the best places NYC has to offer if you know what time and day to go. \n\n-Happy hour is fantastic (3PM - 8PM) if I'm not mistaken. \n-Bill is always ridiculously low!\n-Great service (LOVE YOU RAQUEL!)\n-Delicious food (herb seasoned burger after a few beers, anyone?)\n-Really cool crowd\n-Karaoke nights on Tuesdays! \n\nI would imagine that this place would get pretty crowded on weekends. But, if you're in the mood for great deals on drinks and food after work during the week, this is definitely your spot. It's also conveniently located LITERALLY next to the G train Fulton St. station. \n\nCheck it out!", "author": "Emily S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-25", "description": "In the late 2000s, I posted a review for Moe's, the bar that used to be in this spot, until new owners took over and dropped the E, which brings us to its current name, Mo's.  I have been to the new Mo's a couple of times since then, and frankly, had you not told me anything had changed, I wouldn't know the difference.  It's still the beautiful place it always was.  There are reviewers here who will say otherwise, but they're basically nit-picking and letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  Mo[e]'s is still beautiful as ever.\n\nWith that said, here's my original review of the pre-ownership change Moe's.  Frankly, every word I wrote before still applies.\n\n===\n\nI have a weird life that puts me in New Jersey 2-3 days a week (despite living in Baltimore), and I'll routinely make the trip from there into \"the City,\" and sometimes Brooklyn also.  (I also used to be a resident of the latter, some years back.)  A friend of mine, a former Brooklynite, introduced me to Moe's in 2004 or so, and even now that I've moved down to Baltimore, I make the effort to go whenever I can.  And if I can meet up with a friend or two in NYC, chances are very good that we're going to pop up at Moe's at some point during the night.\n\nThere's something about the mix of folk who frequent Moe's that is near impossible to match outside of Brooklyn.  I find it hard to put the place into a box for this reason -- musically and demographically, this really is the mix of people from all walks of life that America is supposed to be about but in reality, rarely ever is.  Suffice it to say that an American-born person of Indian descent, hanging out in a up-until-recently-primarily-black-but-rapidly-\u00adgentrifying area, one who was raised on '80s and '90s R\u0026B and hip hop and thinks hip hop died after ca. 1995, who doesn't quite identify 100% with White America (TM) or Black America (TM), basically qualifies as an \"average\" customer here.\n\nRiding the cultural fence as I do (because face it, there's no such thing as an \"American-born Indian person bar\" in America), I can tell you that Moe's is the first watering hole I've been to where I really feel a sense of connection.  You may think I'm a little too obsessed with identity politics, but look, \"feeling comfortable\" is a HUGE consideration in how you rate a bar, lounge, etc.  And what's great about Moe's -- or maybe this is more a commentary on Brooklyn itself -- is that it's a place where you can set that baggage aside for a while and just genuinely enjoy the company of other people, forgetting the silly, distracting stuff and just being able to get to know them as human beings.\n\nAnd really, isn't that what it's all about?", "author": "Dheeraj V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-05", "description": "Met up with a girlfriend at Mo's to watch game six of the Knicks/Boston series.  Since there were no seats at the bar, we ended up in the back - which turned out to be just fine.  The fans were fun,  the food was good and though the service was a bit slow (the pretty waitress seemed a little dazed and confused) the back room host was attentive.  \n\nI ordered the Twin Lump Crab Cakes which is served with a lovely salad.  I enjoyed my meal.  I also indulged in one of their ginger infused cocktails - well I actually indulged four times - which was delicious.  Unfortunately for some reason (perhaps the aforementioned 4 cocktails) I can't remember the exact name of the drink.  It was delicious though.  My friend sipped several kettle ones and soda (and wished the bartender had been a little lighter on the soda and heavier on the K1) and snacked on the Lobster Quesidilla which she enjoyed.\n\nOnce the game was over (YAY THE KNICKS WON!), the DJ started spinning and the Friday night crowd started to trickle in.  The DJ spun old school, which made me happy, but unfortunately, they ended up turning off the second game (WTF...it's OKC for goodness sakes), and I promptly lost interest in staying.  The bill was reasonable but parking was a challenge (that said, both the A and G lines have stops in stumbling distance).  Also note it's cash only (booooo, though they do have an ATM).  \n\nThey have lots of events throughout the week.  I'm going to check out Karaoke Tuesdays, and I'll definitely be back to watch a few more Knicks games this season.

We got to relax in the front corner area with wooden benches, comfortable chairs and a tree stump coffee table in the middle. It was a nice place to gather around and discuss the ridiculous happenings of the night before, although I never got to take my jacket off with the door continuously being opened next to us.\n\nThe warm apple cider with rum in it...mmm mmm mmm! It was the perfect post-brunch mid-afternoon drink. It got me ambitious enough to try their wings, even though I was ridiculously full. It was a bad idea, because they were no good.

The service was extremely slow around 8:30-9 pm on a Friday night.

I also liked the crowd, which is slightly different I think than the last crowd.  Still diverse, but a tad more on the young professional side.  There were a lot of women that night-- though another night I popped my head in, there were mostly men and the fight was on TV (another new aspect-- TV, and sports).\n\nI would go back, but it's not what it once was... though it's too early for me to say that it won't ever be.", "author": "Maria M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-08", "description": "This is probably the most un-PC review I'll ever write, but whatever.

The drinks are decent, they have a good happy hour, great events: live music, comedy, karaoke. TVs to watch the game, and hetero ladies if you come sans date you can usually find a gentleman to keep you company, if you're into that sort of thing, but there's a pretty big (and cool) bouncer if you're not into that sort of thing.
