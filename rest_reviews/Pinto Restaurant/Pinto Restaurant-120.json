I got the papaya salad and a tofu pad thai. Both were pretty standard. \n\nThe papaya salad was not the greatest option just because it had an overwhelming fish sauce smell that lingered (and you know that isn't a pretty look for work). Nonetheless, it was refreshing. It had a crisp taste and texture. It came in a small plate portion. \n\nThe pad thai was normal. The noodles weren't too mushy/overcooked and it wasn't overly sweet. The lunch special pad thai was a smaller portion than the regular one (I'm pretty sure I overheard the waitress say that). If I had to describe the portions in handfuls, it would be roughly 2.5 handfuls (I have avg hand-sizes, ones that the media wouldn't make fun of). 2.5 handfuls isn't a lot but enough for lunch.\n\nService was great though. The waitresses were always smiling and were actively nice. \n\n4 stars because I probably wouldn't go here other than for the lunch special. It's easy enough to plan to go to with coworkers but the food was standard.", "author": "Alice Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-19", "description": "Lovely little place for a date night. The service is extremely fast, almost too fast to be true. The food isn't disappointing. The portions are perfect for 1. Although the food could be a little more warm. They also have a limited selection of wines which goes well with the food.  The dessert options are limited. We tried the berry panacotta and it was alright. I sent mine back coz I didn't want it with honey which wasn't mentioned on the menu, so you can decide accordingly. Romantic ambience and very friendly staff.", "author": "Nitiggya P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-02", "description": "came here for lunch + had their lunch special. \ntheir lunch special comes with an app + a main course. i chose mushroom crunch for my app + pcu as my main course. the mushroom crunch was steaming hot + juicy on the inside as the outside was crunchy, lacked some flavor for me but still good. The pcu was yummy + good on flavor. service was really good as they were very attentive filling up my water each time it was running low. would definitely be a place I'd return to.", "author": "Cassie L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-04", "description": "Excellent Thai food! The restaurant is really charming with natural light and a nice view of the street and potted plants. The service was exceptional. Everyone was very friendly and attentive.

I'll keep it brief but in summary, we've discovered a hidden gem in the middle of Brooklyn Heights! The food was 5/5, service was 6/5. Prices were also standard thai restaurant pricing (~$11 for pad thai) so that was a pleasant surprise given the expensive neighborhood its in.\n\nDecor - Very modern/refreshed with a spacious atmosphere.\n\nFood - 5*'s here. I'm a big fan of thai food and have had the good and the worst. What separates this restaurant from your traditional thai place is the presentation (order the thai ice tea, or a soup, and you'll see what i mean)\n\nService - 5*'s as well! We had 2 waiters assisting our party, constantly refilling water/drinks and quickly brought out the appetizers and entrees. Very polite and accommodating as well.\n\nPro Tip - Saving the best for last... but this place is BYOB without any bottle fees!", "author": "Hugh J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "I finally got a chance to checked this restaurant out and it was so good. Prices are even better too. I can't believe how reasonable Pinto is.\n\nI liked the ambiance of the restaurant. Great music with a fun and casual feel. \n\nFOOD \u0026 DRINKS:\nFor food, to start we got an order of fried Calamari(who can go wrong with fried food),their calamari was fresh and more that enough for two. In addition we order the Crispy Chicken with Five Seeds and the Hanger Steak.Everything was delicious! The Crispy Chicken were cut into small pieces and it was very tasty. I also had a piece of the Hanger Steak and it was cook to perfection.\n\nThey don't have alcohol, so we have to settle for soft drinks and your regular Thai Ice Tea. So I thought! To my surprise their Thai Ice Tea presentation was amazing(every ingredient came separately), which allow me to mix it to perfection, just a simple great idea. Highly recommended.\n\nThe service here is really efficient and the servers are all friendly.

The modern decor gets lots of light from large street-facing windows and easily accommodated our party of 12. I could see it being a good place for date nights too.\n\nThe menu has traditional favorites like crab rangoon and pad thai, with an interesting assortment of yummy unexpected dishes like tilapia and hangar steak.

I always passed by here but I decided to finally stop by (after seeing it featured on Eyewitness News Neighborhood Eats). Lemme tell you, probably the best pad thai I've had in the longest. And the shrimp dumplings soo good! I'll definitely be coming back here. The food is soo good, and the staff is so pleasant.

I'm not Thai but I have been to Thailand and have eaten at 100 different Thai restaurants.    This one is amazing.    Very cool decor and atmosphere.    Excellent courteous service.   But it's the food my friend - amazing.    Such flavors!    The papaya salad was spicy but not too spicy and a lot.    The pad Thai which can be boring and sticky or stale was vibrant and fun and fresh - super fresh.    \nCan't find a better lunch deal in brooklyn - only 9 bucks!

Crab meat fried rice served in a roasted coconut husk was amazing, possible the best dish of the meal, the smoky aroma takes me back to the streets of Bangkok. The crispy chicken and black pepper beef are definitely taking liberal interpretations and I felt they were only ok.
