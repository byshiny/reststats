Don't stop here regardless of how hungry you are.  Don't even stop if it's the only breakfast spot between Williamsburg \u0026 Carroll Gardens that has available on street parking.  Think about it.....  There must be a reason why.\n\nFor twenty five years, regardless of the neighborhood, I have never been disappointed until today.  The bodegas all offer fresh grilled egg \u0026 bacon on a soft kaiser roll that is delish.  \n\nNot Fort Greene Deli.  The bacon was so raw that I missed my turn trying to bite through the stubborn meat.  Yes, I do eat while driving in Brooklyn.  But my sandwich difficulties caused extra miles and quite a lot of horn blowing today.\n\nThere must be a rule with bodegas in NYC that the person behind the counter isn't allowed to smile.  But you can feel the underneath warmth in most, especially if you're a regular or mention the Giants or the Mets.\n\nNot so here.  There was no aura of warmth below the surface.  I was left with the feeling that what was there was \"Give me your money \u0026 leave.\"  So that's exactly what I did.", "author": "Carol S."}], "servesCuisine": "Delis", "priceRange": null, "name": "Fort Greene Deli", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "135 Park Ave", "postalCode": "11205", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": null, "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188550001"}
