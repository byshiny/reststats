So we hopped off the boat and decided to give them a try.  There was a line outside the door. We waited for about 45 minutes . Finally we got in and ordered a small pepperoni pizza and two glasses of wine . The server was very nice and professional. When the pizza arrived , it looked great, really cheesy , and saucy. It was a pretty good pizza, almost kind of gourmet style.... thin crust , great sauce and great flavor. Not sure if I'd wait for it again, but it was worth the visit .", "author": "Joanna A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-17", "description": "This is a nice pizza restaurant in DUMBO. I went on a Saturday morning around 11:30 am right when it opened. There was already a line of about 20-30 people. I got a solo seat at the bar. I ordered a small margarita pizza (sauce, mozzarella, basil) and added on pepperoni and sausage w/fennel. There were eight good-sized slices. I had a lemonade to drink. It came with a paper straw. The pizza and lemonade were very good. The crust is thin and had a pretty good ratio of crispiness to chewiness. It wasn't quite as good of a crust as the pillowy soft offering of Una Pizzeria Napoletana, but the toppings were very good. Sauce was perhaps a bit more tangy than Joe's or Di Fara's, but still very good. Overall, Juliana's produces a very good, balanced pizza in a clean, festive environment. Even the music selection was good. They played \" It Don't Come Easy\", by Ringo Starr (with a songwriting assist from George Harrison). If you have time, it's worth the ferry ride from Manhattan once in a while.", "author": "James S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-30", "description": "I'm sorry, but I don't get the hype. The lines are long, the prices are high, and the pie is simply average. There are many better places in and around the city.\n\nI have a theory, in fact, that the long lines actually cause you to believe that you're having a great experience; you're starving after waiting in line for so long that anything would taste amazing.

Really really good pizza here . It's worth the wait .

The restaurant was clean, well run and friendly.  I got the Caesar salad and the dressing was incredible. We got the margarita pizza, New York pizza toppings by the way of cheese is scarce.

With my group, tried 4 different pizzas (No.2, No. 3, No. 4, and a pepperoni) and they were all delicious with a yummy crispy crust! The ones with red sauce were my favorite because the sauce was so flavorful and peppery. Even the salad that we got as an appetizer we great - arugula with cherry tomatoes, goat cheese, walnuts - yum!

We tried the non tomato pizza that had truffle oil. My girlfriend and I are HUGE fans of truffle oil and it was an easy choice. While the pizza was still incredibly tasty, we didn't taste any truffle oil. \n\nThey close the restaurant from around 3-4 pm to allow a complete turnover and cleaning of the place. We waited in the line for 30 minutes (from 3:30) until 4 pm, but were very courteous and informed the line of their changeover. Once they re-opened they sat each table one at a time and allowed the server to get started so that they could ensure excellent service and that the kitchen and staff weren't overwhelmed. \n\nThe wait was worth it, the service was fabulous and the Pizza was incredible!

However, when the uber dropped us off across the street, I saw the sign for Juliana's and I decided that it would be even better to come here.  We waited to be seated a fairly long line, so I amused myself by reading the following Wikipedia entry about the history of Juliana's:\n\n\"Pasquale 'Patsy' Lancieri founded a bakery in East Harlem in 1925. He converted the bakery to a pizzeria in 1933 and named it Patsy's Pizzeria, hiring his namesake nephew Pasquale 'Patsy' Grimaldi as a cook. Following in his uncle's footsteps, Grimaldi opened Grimaldi's Pizzeria on Old Fulton Street in 1990. The building has a history dating back to the 18th century, originally built as a tavern and later owned by Dipoline Manufacturing Company before becoming a pizzeria. In 1998, Grimaldi retired and sold the Grimaldi's brand name and franchise to Frank Ciolli. Several years later, Ciolli moved Grimaldi's Pizzeria to a larger building across the street. In 2011, Grimaldi announced he was coming out of retirement at the age of 80, but was unable to open a restaurant in his own name due to selling his brand rights. In 2012, he opened Juliana's, named after his mother Maria \"Juliana\" Lancieri Grimaldi, in Grimaldi's former location, starting a rivalry between the two.\"\n\nAfter I digested the above information, I realized that the Grimaldi's pizza I was familiar with (from visits to locations in Las Vegas and California) was actually a completely different animal than the original pizza I was about to experience at Juliana's.  We were finally seated, and I was really excited to try one of these pies!\n\nTo make a long story just a tad shorter, my excitement survived our waiter's indifferent, lackluster service, and the fact that it took almost half an hour to get water and our drinks.  It even stayed with me for the 45 minutes it took for our pizza to arrive at our table.  It completely headed South when I cut into the pie and tried the first slice...\n\nWe ordered a small Margherita pie, to which we added pepperoni and garlic.  Unlike the Grimaldi's pies I've enjoyed many times, Juliana's crust was soggy, undercooked, and bland-tasting.  There was just something missing; add to that the medicre taste profile of the cheese and the totally unimpressive sauce, and I couldn't imagine why I'd ever even consider coming back to eat here again, even without all the waiting.\n\nBottom line: The \"original\" isn't always best.  I think Frank Ciolli did good things with Grimaldi's recipe after he bought the rights in the 1990s.  I look forward to visiting another Grimaldi's location again in the not too distant future, but I won't be returning to Juliana's.", "author": "Jake P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-27", "description": "A gem in dumbo located next to Grimaldi's, Juliana's is an old-fashioned pizza restaurant with a pizza parlor vibe and super helpful servers. A medium pizza is huge ! And you will most likely bring home leftovers if splitting it with another person. \n\nThe crust is thin but still soft and not dry, the sauce and the cheese have the perfect ratio. My only critique is that it is not as customizable as most other pizza places I go to. There are toppings on some pizzas that they don't allow you to put on others which was confusing, however, I still enjoyed what I ordered ! They definitely stick to the classics and do those well.", "author": "Allie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-17", "description": "Favorite pizza around NY! I first learned about this pizza place back in 2016 and have been bringing friends and family here ever since! It is always a great time and everyone enjoys the food here.\n\nThis place opens at 11:30am during the weekends and I would recommend getting here when it opens to avoid having to wait in line! Make sure your party arrives on time since they will not seat you until everyone is here!\n\nI have tried different types of their pizzas, but my favorite is still the Margherita! You can't go wrong with the basics (tomato, mozzarella and basil). Their crust is thin and chewy with light crispiness around the edges. I like how they spread out the toppings to almost the edges leaving just enough crust for you to be able to pick up the pizza. \n\nWould definitely recommend going to DUMBO to try out this pizza place.

Juliana's pizza offers some of the best pizzas in Brooklyn . More importantly, they offer half and half pie.

This allows you to see the chefs making pizzas right in front you. While you're waiting for your own pizzas, your mouth will start watering by looking at dozens of pizzas make in front of you.
