You won't be disappointed here.\n\nMy go-to (and their best sandwich without a doubt) is the Porchetta sandwich. It has a good amount of pork (some juicy fat included) in crunchy, toasted ciabatta bun. I can't really recall what else is in it, but it is delicious. You'll easily recognize that it's a high-quality sandwich. I get this sandwich 90% of the time because it's just that good. \n\nMy back-up is the chicken sandwich here. It's very tasty as well, but it doesn't even come close to the pork sandwich.\n\nNote: The Porchetta is the best seller here and it sells out between 1pm-2pm, so come here early if you want to try it.\n\nTip: Call before you go. It does get a little busy around lunch time so don't be surprised if there's a wait for the food prep.\n\nRemember to get your loyalty card punched -- 1 free sandwich after 10.", "author": "Simon Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-09", "description": "Tasty well made sandwich.

I'm ok to wait 5-10 minutes but over 15 minutes is a little excessive. The porchetta sandwich was a bit dry and not worth the wait. I also stunk like grease for the rest of the day because there doesn't appear to be proper venting in this place.", "author": "Emily R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-09", "description": "Came in for \"The Sandwich\", which they don't start serving until 11:00 or 11:30 unfortunately, so I settled for the breakfast sandwich.  It comes with a choice of meats (bacon, ham, or turket bacon), spread (pepper aioli, mayo, or garlic spread), and bread (seeded or ciabatta).  Additionally you have optional egg, avocado, and veggies.\n\nI went with the turkey bacon and pepper aioli on a ciabatta with everything.  Not bad at all.  It did take a bit longer than I thought it would to make, possibly because my friend and I arrived at 9am on a weekday and the breakfast rush may have been in progress.  And the space by the register is a bit tight, so we had to shuffle around to make room for customers while we waited.\n\nWe ate outside in the area next to the Manhattan Bridge, which was a bit noisy with the constant stream of trains going by.  Next time I'd check out the inside seating area.  Unfortunately they are closed on weekends and I don't work in the area, so my odds of coming back and trying my preferred sandwich in the near future are slim.", "author": "Richie T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-25", "description": "Vegetarian sandwiches can oftentimes be a hit or miss for me. Sometimes the veggie slide out of a sammich, veggies with high water content (ie cucumbers, zucchini) soak through the bread because you decided it was good to travel with a veggie sandwich, and the like.\n\nBread \u0026 Spread offers the perfect vegetable sandwich: the Giardino. Please get this. The veggies were so thinly sliced that nothing fell out of the sandwich upon tight embrace or, you know, biting into the thing.\n\nIt's a very tight space, so it takes a little while to make said perfect sandwich. It's almost like they're these recent college grads making these lovely things with a tiny toaster oven in their garage. That silly romantic twist makes the sandwich taste better.", "author": "Kendra C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-20", "description": "The best breakfast sandwich in Brooklyn, hands down. No bagels needed - the bread alone is amazing and their green verde sauce is INSANELY good so make sure to get that on your sandwich! \n\nStaff is great, friendly and fast!

We were not disappointed!  Girl at the counter was super friendly, that's always refreshing. \n$15 for 2 breakfast egg sandwiches and 2 small coffees.

If there's one piece of advice I can give you, let that be it. You will spare yourself a lengthy wait. Trust me.\n\nI split the prochetta and the vegetarian with a co-worker. And, I rarely say this, but I thought the veggie was even BETTER than the porchetta.
