Luckily when we went we didn't have to wait too long. Everything just tasted right and it was fresh. I wouldn't change anything about it.

The crust was outstanding, but the cheese, sauce, oil, and herbs were so haphazardly applied that each bite either lacked in or overwhelmed you with one ingredient.  That being said, the quality of the ingredients used make this an almost excusable offense.  However, a five star pizza should create something greater than the sum of its parts.", "author": "Casey G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-14", "description": "The best I've had in the city.  I love Fornino's, but that's more for pizza with the frills, like capers and anchovies and fresh herbs and such.  At Grimaldi's I got the plain, and it was perfect... add to that nice waiters, a great vibe... and, again, the pizza... THE PIZZA.\n\nSigh.

YES!\" is what I would have been saying if my mouth wasn't crammed full of delicious delicous Grimaldi's pizza. I make it a point to go here every time I'm in the city. The generously sized pizzas are easily and quickly devoured even by the lightest of eaters as they discover previously unknown room in their bellies. It's that good.\n\nLast time I was there I sat next to a couple who have ate two entire pizzas! Each! That's 4 pizzas total! and they weren't lardos either. It brings out the best in people.\n\nYou may have to wait outside on line for around an hour. But it's worth it. The wait staff may be impolite and somewhat rude.

My heart is still in it for Chicago.\n\nThis is a great place to go; just walk from Manhattan, over the Brooklyn Bridge, then stop for a pizza. \n\nYou'll likely have to wait in line. Though; don't worry. They move pretty fast. They'll usually let people in blocks of 4-8 people every ~5/10 minutes.  It will be a bit crowded inside.\n\nThe food, was so good. The pizza sauce has a slightly tangy flavor too it. It really tastes like they use fresh tomatos and ingredients. The mozzarella.. I'm not a cheese lover.. but it as so good.\n\nNow as for the basil. It comes with a few here and there. Get extra. I'm not a basil person; but the basil complements the sauce so well. Perfect!! We're getting extra basil next time.\n\nThe pepperoni was crispy.. crispy spicy pepperoni. Can you beat that? It's thick.. and flavorful too. OMG.. so good.\n\nThis is definately my top New York Style pizza place. :)", "author": "John C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-21", "description": "Just Go eat there!!!!\n\nA small place in Brooklyn with a nice view of the Brooklyn bridge and Manhattan sky line.

I went with my family and my dog to Brooklyn Height and wanna to try Grimaldi's therefore I want to get take out since my dog can not go in. The guy told me if I want to get take out, I have to wait on the same line as people who wants a table. FINE! I was expecting to wait anyways so I waited online.  We waited for 2 hrs because he keep on call party of 2. Finally we are the first on line and the guy who is managing the line refuse to let me in to order my take out. He keep sending people of 4 in and they are the people who is lining up behind me. I ask him what am I waiting for and all he said was,\"pls understand these are people who are dining in and you are taking out.\" I was like I totally understand that, but why can't you let me in to order my take out first since I am next in line and they are behind me! Then he had the nerve to tell me that these ppl are there lining up longer than I am! I got very piss off and start to screaming at him and was like I was online waiting as long as these pplz are and longer! I am in font of them how can they be waiting longer than I am!! These doesn't make ANY SENSE!!! \nAfter all these talking back he has nth to say and just send in inside to order! This whole line management thing is very F*CK  UP!
