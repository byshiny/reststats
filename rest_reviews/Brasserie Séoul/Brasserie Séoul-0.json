Looks like this place was recently renovated and rebranded as a hotel floor restaurant. I'm glad they added a Korean twist to their food.\n\nWe started with oysters, which were good and decently priced. The bulgogi plate came in a cast iron and was delicious. We also opted for the Korean fried chicken wings, which were so amazingly and surprisingly spicy. \n\nGreat and friendly service. An awesome find in DoBro if you need a quick evening option.", "author": "Kevin T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-02-18", "description": "This review is just for the food. Service was great, very nice and accommodating hosts/waiters. (Would give 4-5 stars based on that alone)\n\nBrasserie Seoul based on the better views, sets higher than normal expectations for hotel restaurants but doesn't meet them. \n\nThe food isn't inedible, it just isn't what you would expect. Having made these dishes myself before and watching pro chefs online prepare them, this is my best guess at how Brasserie Seoul put the following dishes together:\n\nKorean fried chicken wings- mostly likely reheated frozen wings (soggy skin).\nTruffle mac n cheese- most likely instant mac, no flavor and just a bit of watery cheese. \nSteak au poivre- no peppercorns (queue Sterling Archer).\nHudson valley duck- duck breast was cooked well but no seasoning.\n\nI'd skip eating here altogether since you can probably go down the block and pick up a pastrami egg and cheese that won't disappoint lol\n\nSide note: Yelp page reports the venue dress code attire as 'dressy', it's not", "author": "Jimmy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-03-22", "description": "We were staying at the Holliday Inn and were happy to find this place.  We sat at the bar every night and Jordan took great care of us, remembering our drink orders and making recommendations.

There's a place in the back that's outdoorsy without being exposed to the elements; as perfect as one could ask for. \n\nBRUNCH TIL 4!!! Really good menu setup and honestly a slamming burger if brunch isn't desired. \n\nShannon is a solid waitress.

The restaurant was bright and cozy. The Chef came by and explained the inspiration and key ingredients of the dishes, giving personal suggestions on which main we should go with. \n\nWe started with a simple field green salad with wild flowers, heirloom tomato salad, truffle tteock \u0026 cheese and fricassee de champignons. All was delicious and easy to shared! The truffle tteock \u0026 cheese was the crowd pleaser, assembling a decadent Mac \u0026 Cheese but with the Korean rice cake. So delicate but satisfying! \n\nI went with the Beef Bourguignon and I know it is good because I had a version of it at Park's Bistro Petit. It is presented differently this time with a lid which is a subtle nod to its Korean inspiration galbi jjim. The short rib is so tender and every component of the dish balances with earthiness, saltiness and sweetness. \n\nThe meal ended with a tart Blueberry Soup and Beignet with ice cream.

Once we finally got someones attention we had to use the bathroom. Bathrooms are locked because it is attached to the hotel, we had to ask for the bathroom key, TWICE.\n\nThe appetizers were ordered, and they never came back to get our entree order. Once we were half done with our appetizers they took down or entree order. The appetizers were okay, I did enjoy the Portuguese octopus but the artichoke flatbread and burrata taste like something that came from a jar. The beef tartare was okay. \n\nOnce our entree orders were in, we waited for a good 20min to get our food. Once arrived, one of the orders were wrong, so we had to wait for that to get cooked. I got the long neck clams in linguini, it was WAYYYY too salty. We also go the steak which was cooked to our specifications but didn't have a great taste. The burger was also okay. \n\nOverall the experience was not great, I feel bad because the name of the place gives off an interesting name of Korean fusion. Nothing about the food was Korean, and barely French. Seemed more Italian to me. The waiter did try to justify the experience by giving complimentary drinks etc but the restaurant just isn't as good as it used to be. I hope they improve the staff as well as the quality of food.", "author": "Julio G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-08", "description": "What brought me here is that I always used to go to bistro Petit and then Chef Park came here. I loved that they had a book on oysters. I got the prime burger, medium rare as per usual, and my friend ordered one the Cavatelli Both were great. The fries accompanying the burger were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, thick and well seasoned. The cocktail I got - the expat punch was great as well, reminded me of a whiskey sour. I chose it for the toasted barley tea and the toasted barley flavor didn't really present itself but it was still a solid choice.  Then for dessert we split some sort of fruit mousse, I believe it was either mango or passion fruit with strawberry. The interior is very white, with pop music playing in the background. Neither too casual not too buttoned up.

Turns out that chef Tae Goo Kang opened up a new restaurant after closing the one in Williamsburg (Bistro Petit).

Bistro Petit was amazing, and the only reason that I dined here was to have the Kimchi bouillabaisse. What a let Down.", "author": "Ariel P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-28", "description": "The first time I dined here about six month ago, the name of the restaurant was Brasserie S\u00e9oul, and the cuisine was clearly defined as French-Korean Fusion. The dishes were unique and satisfying, the waiters were incredibly friendly, and the restaurant was fully deserving of a four star review. I came back last week and saw that \"S\u00e9oul\" has been dropped on the menus, although not on Yelp or even on their website, so judging by the new name alone, I'm guessing the cuisine is now simply French? Things I saw on the menu: 3 different Italian pastas, Italian crudo, burrata flatbread (that would be Italian again), Portuguese octopus, Mediterranean hummus/olive/feta appetizer, just to name a few. Things I did not see on the menu: a single French dish, unless you want to count the fact that French fries go by Frites here. Confused? Yeah, me too.\n\nSo here's where things get even more complicated: I came back here for the weekly Monday CUBAN night and the extended happy hour because my boyfriend's parents were staying at the Holiday Inn right above Brasserie. Our waiter got instantly defensive when we asked about the happy hour, rudely stating that happy hour only goes until 7PM daily, and that the only Monday special is the discounted mojito. He then rushed off to loudly complain about our question to the bartender. Exact words on the Monday menu \"Live Cuban music. Happy hour 6PM to 9PM. ALL NIGHT $7 Cuban Mojito.\" To clarify further, the restaurant is open until 11 PM and has a long separate Happy Hour menu. How would you interpret that \"special\"? We made the mistake of staying even after all this because we were exhausted, but I wish we had found better plans for the night once we knew the whole Cuban night and happy hour was a fluke. Oh, and there was no band or live music anywhere in sight. No es bueno.\n\nThe $1 oysters we managed to order right before 7 PM would be something positive to point out, but our waiter went to complain about us yet again to the bartender when we asked for crackers or a side of bread to have with the oysters, then awkwardly came back empty-handed having forgotten to actual bring the crackers or bread and had to be reminded. Also, the oysters came with a side of salsa. \u00bfQue? The salmon entree was overshadowed by the simple side of polenta it came with, although not one person out of our group of four could taste the truffle oil that was advertised for this dish. The artichoke flatbread was luckily only big enough for one bite for a each of us because it tasted like bland cardboard.\n\nBrasserie is in need of some serious help with its identity crisis, unprofessional waiting staff, and the disorganized, uninspired dishes the chef pushes out. It's sad to see a new hot spot that seemed so full of potential just a short six months ago has fully turned into nothing more than a standard, overpriced, empty, S\u00e9oul-less hotel restaurant.
