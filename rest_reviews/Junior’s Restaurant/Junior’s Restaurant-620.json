The original location!  I have mail ordered many a cheesecake from Juniors and they have all been delicious.  After Di Fara we drove over here to get a cheesecake to go.  We were going to go with straight up strawberry but they didnt have any plain.  They only had one with a crumb topping.  We got a small one and I was hoping and praying that crumb topping didnt mess it up.  Well....it might have made it better.  The crumb topping is the same type of crumbs they use for old school candied apples.  It was soooooo good!  Juniors does cheesecake with a sponge cake bottom.  It was so rich and delicious.  The strawberries were great and that crumb topping set it over the top.  \n\nJuniors makes the best cheesecakes in the world!  Hands down!  It was amazing as usual!", "author": "Tim S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-29", "description": "This is a great casual spot to get a hearty meal for a reasonable price.\n\nPros:\n-massive portions\n-wide selection of food\n-everything you want in a diner\n-reasonable price\n-friendly staff\n\nCons:\n-only thing that wasn't on the menu was grits!

It's extremely overrated. If you go, get the cheesecake and ONLY the cheesecake, which was good but not just out of this world amazing. Unsure what type of food this was supposed to be, but they started our experience with beets, pickles, cucumbers and Cole slaw for appetizers. How random. None of the entrees we ordered were tasty.

The one's in Manhattan are okay, but the reason you go to Junior's is for the cheesecake, and they're just bigger/better here.\n\nBeen here several times (which is a trek in itself) - and each for the strawberry cheesecake. The rest of the menu is just okay, standard diner selection with egregious portions. I want to come back and try different cheesecakes, but it's hard not to pick the best (especially since they're so large).", "author": "Shaji K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-15", "description": "Pretty good food, but for out of towners and tourists such as myself, the real reason for visiting was its frequently touted \"best\" cheesecake of NYC. To be fair, that's a reputation that builds up a high expectation. \n\nThe cheesecake does not live up to the reputation and is especially disappointing given the high price of a slice. It's good, but nothing to rave about. If the numerous advertisements about Junior's cheesecake all over NYC didn't give a hint, this place is yet another establishment on NYC's list of over-hyped touristy food spots.", "author": "Diana X."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-26", "description": "Heard how their cheesecake was a must try and indeed it is!

Someone please tell me what I missed here.  The service was terrible.  The food was bad.  The prices were not reflective of the quality.  The place looks dated.\n\nSo we were plopped down in the middle of the restaurant at one of the worst tables in a sea of emptiness.  Our waitress was very cold, not very attentive, hard to get to do anything for us.  I think she was trying, but it didn't seem like she was in the right line of business.  Some people can do this job, some can't.  I, for example, would throw things in people's faces.  That's not a good trait for a waiter, so I avoid it.\n\nSo I had a sandwich and paid extra for everything, including for the non-upgrade tasting rolls I had it on.  It was your pretty typical deli sandwich, nothing special.  Dry meat; we had to beg for something to put on the sandwich.  The potato salad was . . . fine, I guess.  It was way overpriced for what it was, even for here.\n\nWe had dessert, figuring that their cheesecake seemed to be what makes them famous.  It was fine, but it wasn't anything special.  The poundcake crust (or whatever cake it was) seemed like an odd choice.  The cheesecake was very dry in about 1/3 of it and the raspberry flavoring only barely resembled a raspberry flavor.  I can throw together a better cheesecake in a couple hours, and can make a far superior cheesecake with more time.\n\nI'm giving two stars because it wasn't terrible, but it's definitely overrated.", "author": "Ryan A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-05", "description": "Wow!

My husband order the ribs and fried chicken and couldn't finish it. He said it was delicious..\u0026 being a southern man that's a huge compliment! I had a garden salad, steak, mixed veggies a baked potato and lobster tail and some red wine. It was so good. I love good steak I like mine dark on the outside but nice \u0026 juicy on the inside lol. It was juicy with every bite!! We ordered linguine for the kids and they loved it. After we ordered two slices of the cheesecake. I had the chocolate moose and my husband had the apple crumb. We sampled each others and I just took his. The kids \u0026 I tore that apple crumb cheesecake up..my husband said do you want to get one to go? I said heck no..Addictions are too hard to quit..and I'm not pregnant so I won't have an excuse!!

The cheesecakes were excellent. We tried red velvet, plain (my favorite), sugar-free and the strawberry topped ( they didn't like the gelatin on top and wished they got plain). Our service was great.

This is probably the only thing I can eat a whole piece of myself. The lemon meringue pie was good too. But the sourness of the lemon becomes overpowering after a few bites. I also had the chocolate swirl cheesecake. But was only able to take a few bites too because of the thick texture and sweetness.\n\nBesides the desserts, I also tried the bacon cheeseburger.

All huge size portions, serve fast and at the correct temperature.    All dishes were great.\nDessert 10  their famous strawberry cheesecake  was delicious.  It's a classic cheesecake topped with fresh strawberries within a kind of strawberry jelly. Was great, is the kind of real cheese, not the commercial fluffy or light cheese cake.    In others word not the commercial. Hello type cheesecake\nWe also try the chocolate swirl, also great.\nRestroom and general- 3.5.    Why the bathrooms are in the second floor.
