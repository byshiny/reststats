It is a step above the smoke shop/ deli that's why I gave them 4's. The Philly steak and eggs sandwich was okay. I wish they added peppers and onions but was scared to add it myself due to there extensive up charges. I had to pay extra for a croissant instead of bagel and provolone instead of American cheese... At the end my sandwich cost an extra 1.50. $7 for a breakfast sandwich, no mimosas or bellinis? Could have went to a brunch spot and at least get served eggs, bacon etc. for that price. It was nothing special that made me want to return to this spot. Students do get a discount, that is a plus... Right?", "author": "Crystal G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-20", "description": "If I were to give this rating purely on bagel marks, it would receive 5 glowing stars. The bagels are excellent, a necessity in a neighborhood where good bagel shops are surprisingly few. These chewy bagels are slightly crispy on the outside and fresh out of the oven, a perfect 10 on the bagel scoreboard. \n\nMy critique is small, much like the shop, which for this reason doesn't have the largest selection of spreads.  You can get your typical chive, dill, vegetable, or lox shmear, and a few low fat and tofu shmears, but a greater variety of tofu and low fat options is not be found.  I might sound picky, but I have fond memories of the glorious Ess-a-Bagel formerly on 1st and 21st, which had more shmears than shades of colors in the rainbow. The coffee is also not so tasty.\n\nI must compliment the excellent (but small) selection of sweets, including many flavors of rugelach, hamentaschen, black and white cookies, brownie bars, and those teeny little slivers of multi layered rainbow cake.\n\nStill, there's a reason why this little bagel shop has stood on the block for 30 years.  It has a new regular customer.", "author": "Risha L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-21", "description": "If you're craving a bagel this place is good.

I got a whole wheat bagel with veggie cream cheese and bacon. They didn't put a ton of bacon on but that's ok. They did put a good amount of cream cheese. The bagels are thick but tasty. My iced coffee was decent, a little too much milk but not bad. I think they have flagels (flat bagels) which I wanna get next time.\nThe customer service is really good and efficient.

The staff really hustles things along and tried to get you in and out as quickly as they can. There's also a handful of tables to enjoy your food inside or do some work.  I've recently tried their lunch offerings (sandwiches, salads) and found the quality to be excellent.

When they used to have friendlier register staff, it masked the fact that they're slow as molasses for every. single. order. Now there's now denying it's an average bagel place that cannot adequately support it's foot traffic at any time of day. One sandwich 15 min, consistently. Pity to give a poor review because of this reason.", "author": "Josh A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-22", "description": "My neighborhood lunchtime staple.  What would I do without you La Bagel Delight?  Awesome bagels, and skinny bagel options (for those kinds of people), and lots of cream cheese options.  They have a great sandwich menu - I personally LOVE the Bourbon Street - which is spicy turkey, mozz, jalapenos, and grilled onions.  Also the chicken fajita pannini is a delicious deal and comes with a bag of chips and a can of soda for something stupid, like $6 total!  They also have HUGE-O ice coffee cups if you ask for it.  Sometimes you just need a ginormous ice coffee.  They've got a case juices and drinks, and all sorts of goodies.  Tons of chips.  I love this place.  VERY friendly people behind the counter too - props to them!  \n\nI've also ordered catering from them for an event at my theatre, and they delivered it, it was beautiful, delicious, LOCAL, and worth the price. They also have a new rewards type system called Belly, just scan your card and earn free stuff.", "author": "Amanda H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-13", "description": "The bagels are amazing. It was super early and the girl asked me something, I didn't hear her, and she called me out for ignoring her. Pretty embarrassing. I also made a somewhat large order and asked the guy to do me a favor and cut them in half as our conference space wouldn't have a big knife. He did not. That was a let down.

Service is terrible.

For those of you who love options for their bagel toppings, this place is for you. Me, I rather standard cream cheese on my bagel. There are also several good looking options for tuna salads, and they also have a salad bar. My rating wasn't higher than 4 stars for this place just because the latte was not the best at all, which I expected better coffee from a bagel spot.
