The boneless wings are pretty good, and there is a whole variety of different sauces, well discriminated by how spicy they are. The sandwiches are kinda small, so you may want to head to Applebees, right next to it, in order to exterminate your warrior hunger. Can get pretty noisy with those 500000000000000000 TVs they have. When important games are happening, the place can get REALLY crowded.

The food is good here, but the first time I went it was on 50 cent wing night , and my wings tasted like they had been sitting out all day and reheated in a microwave. That day I was very disappointed but my most recent visit was on a regular night and my wings were delicious ! I also had the nacho appetizer which was great also. The bad thing about this location is that the customer service SUCKS. Every time. Im not a hard-ass when it comes to service, I just want my service to be exceptional \u0026 standard .. So it upsets me that I have to say that the staff here are rude and inattentive. On my recent visit to BWW we waited for our server for 30 min. The hosts and busboys were standing around laughing and joking with each other and watched us just sit there waiting , and didn't even have the decency to tell our server that they had a table. We had to ask the host himself to find our server after 30 min. Once our server finally came he seemed angry, didn't introduce himself, did NOT apologize; he just simply said \"What do you want to order?\" We told him what we wanted and he just walked away. He delivered our drinks and we never saw him after that, etc. Keep in mind that there were barely any customers that day. It was definitely not a full house .. Not even halfway full. Get it together Buffalo Wild Wings (Brooklyn).", "author": "Cia F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-15", "description": "Let me just start by saying that I am a big fan of boneless buffalo chicken and this place can make them really good. I was here with a relative of mine and we enjoyed ourselves. We mainly went there to watch a UFC event and that's what I like about this place, THE SPORTS!!!! Another thing about this place is that although the waiter was nice but the service a bit on the slow side. After we ordered our food I would say that everything took about 40-45 minutes to be brought to our table. But although the service was slow, the food on the other hand was grea", "author": "Zinad K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-06", "description": "Food was average at best.

Lets start this out right. I am a fan of BWW. I enjoy their food atmosphere and games. None of that pertains to this particular establishment. The food is often improperly cooked and the wings unevenly sauced. The service is slow and inattentive and there always seems to be a  wait for a table; even when the place is half empty.  They even lack the buzztime gaming that is a staple at BWW. Avoid if possible, but if you do go, please don't judge the franchise based on this particular establishment; you'd be missing a jewel.", "author": "Anthony M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-03", "description": "Service honestly probably couldn't have been worse. My husband and I went in for lunch during the week. Not that many people were in there and still we waited forvever to give our order or any kind of service.

This is particularly odd since I am a self-proclaimed wing connoisseur.\n\nI came here with a friend on Friday afternoon for a quick wing-a-ling snack.  I was actually surprised at how big it is inside.  The service was friendly and efficient.  Prices are reasonable.  We had the medium sauce and honey bbq.  It was good, like chain restaurant good. The blue cheese was a bit watered down.\n\nI will probably come back here since it's on the way home, cheap, and seems like a good place to kick back, have a beer, wing, and a relaxing time.", "author": "Donna A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-28", "description": "My friend and go every two months for a Tuesday night outting to Brooklyn for Target and Buffalo Wild Wings.  It's always a great night.\n\nWe choose Buffalo Wild Wings for 4 reasons:  1.) 50 cent wings 2.) $3 bud lights 3.) proximity to Target and 4.) Byron\n\nThe wing experience has almost always been great.  Although, I don't recommend the hot sauce.  I couldn't eat more than 3 wings!    The mild, medium and Asian zing are my favorites.  Once I got the puniest set of wings I'd ever seen...but for the most part, they are really good!\n\n$3 bud lights go great with the wings.  And pre-game before Target is always pleasurable.  I came home with a hula hoop on my last trip!\n\nByron is great.  We look forward to having him as our waiter.  He brings our beers quickly, is attentive, nice, and always has good recommendations!  But to get him, you need to sit in the bar area.  You can sit immediately in the bar area.  Seems hundreds of people prefer to wait for hours to NOT sit in the bar area.  Never quite understood this phenomenon....\n\nOther things to note:  Mini corn dogs were great one time, not so great another.  The nachos look great, but I haven't had them yet.  The onion rings and all of the potato varieties are good.  i wouldn't stray too far from the wings.\n\nThey have trivia and poker at the bar.  Lots of TV's with all of the sporting events available.", "author": "Katie M."}], "servesCuisine": "American (Traditional)", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Buffalo Wild Wings", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "139 Flatbush Ave", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ENoWKg2ScYUtSOPF-xpcJA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17189439453"}
