The place is clean and neat, small, and the employees (or owners) were very attentive. Got a toasted sesame seed bagel with turkey, lettuce, tomato. Was about $7 and packed with food. Reasonable price, decent food, and didn't take forever. If you don't see what you like on the menu, just ask for what you want. Seems the wall menu is packed with $12+ stuff only.", "author": "John W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-28", "description": "Not sure why some of the other reviews are not great (maybe I need to try lunch?).

The egg on the bagel was a bit on the too fried side for me. I would have preferred a much more fluffy egg, but that's just my taste.

They're known for their hand-rolled bagels as well as their 'Who's next?' yell-outs for quick/efficient service.  The hubs and I were in DUMBO, and while waiting for a brunch reservation, we decided to give La Bagel Delight to kill some time :P  They offer breakfast bagels (with butter or jelly, cream cheese, sliced cheese, cream cheese \u0026 jelly, specialty cream cheeses, lox, or grilled items (bacon, Canadian bacon, sausages, grilled ham, pancetta, etc.)), muffins, croissants, turnovers, soups, and sandwiches/salads.  I had the Onion bagel (toasted) with Scallion cream cheese (it had onion bits all around the bagel; large and slightly crisp exterior, with a generous spread of cream cheese with scallions; the cream cheese was okay, but it wasn't anything special, as it wasn't as creamy and not enough of a pronounced scallion taste to it); the hubs had the 2 eggs with bacon on an Egg bagel (this, we were both not fans of, as the scrambled eggs within were overcooked, and the egg bagel had an off-taste to it).

It's pretty tough to mess up a bagel with tofu and a small coffee, but I probably could find something in the DUMBO trash that tastes better. \n\nMy bagel was okay but had a weird aftertaste. Like it had pickle juice in it or something. The texture was good but it tastes horrible, and the veggie cream cheese (which was spread so thin I barely noticed it was there) wasn't much better. My coffee was horrible-tasted like it was brewed a week ago and reheated. Fortunately Im not in this neighborhood often.

Everyone told me the water in NYC makes the bagels taste different, and they're so right!! The bagels here are so much bigger than those in other states. They were really nice and fluffy with a hard exterior. \n\nNormally I can eat 2 bagels in 1 sitting, but these NYC bagels are filling. This location offers a TOFU VEGGIE CREAM CHEESE spread that was amazing. Who knew Tofu + Cream Cheese could be so delicious and creamy!\n\nI wish this place offered a better coffee/espresso selection, but I suppose it's a bagel shop not a cafe. \n\nFor one bagel, it's about $1.00.", "author": "Mary Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-06", "description": "For you Californians remember you pay when your order is ready and have you mind made up!
