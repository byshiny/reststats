Tried the burger and the salmon club.  Both came with fries and greens.  The burger was one of the best I've had.  So juicy and flavorful.  BUT the bun was store bought and cold - not cool.  The burger was so good we ignored the bun, but a brioche or other fresh bread would have made it better.  The salmon club was really good too but had too many red onions for my taste.  The fries were awesome.\n\nThe service was lacking and our waitress forgot our drinks.  She didn't apologize and the place wasn't that full.  We flagged down someone else to ask for our drinks since we had seen them sitting at the bar and they were kind enough to bring them over.\n\nVerdict: food 4 stars, service 2 stars", "author": "Marina R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-04-17", "description": "They are not baby/stroller friendly.  I won't go back.

Their fries are so good, I haven't stopped thinking about them since I've had them here. \n\nWe came during an extended happy hour on a weekend, apparently they had too many oysters for the week and needed to serve them before they went bad. Not complaining at all.\n\nWe also had the seviche which was also great, you could tell the ingredients were very fresh.", "author": "Amy W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-12", "description": "Service here was fantastic.

I had the eggs benedict which was delish - the eggs were perfectly runny, the ham was grilled with a nice rosemary flavor and the English muffin tasted very fresh and was a little doughy to contrast with the typical flat English muffin I'm used to for brunch. The place is really cute and my friends enjoyed their food (a quiche and crepe) as well. I've been to the popular, next door brunch spot (Colonie) and definitely was more impressed with the food at Chez Moi. Colonie has a bit more of a vibe-y atmosphere to it but Chez Moi is a nice go to when you want good food and don't want to deal with a crowd. The service was also great and our food came within 15m or so of ordering.", "author": "Katie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-08", "description": "Such a cute French spot with a great atmosphere.

Good service, decent food (my blueberry pancake was almost like a muffin in consistency which I didn't really enjoy), and cute interior. Being that it was a holiday weekend, the place was not super packed and we didn't have to wait for a table. There were perhaps 5 other groups of people and EVERY SINGLE ONE included at least 1 child, most had 2! I'm not a kids person so when there are kids yelling or running around, I am disgruntled. Will probably come back if I'm in the area for dinner.... everyone was having brunch mussels which seemed to be the thing to have! Will prob not miss it if I never came back... lots of similar French cafes in the hood", "author": "Michelle Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-02-20", "description": "I have been here a few times for dinner and it has become one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The waitstaff is fantastic. Every server that I have had here has been incredibly nice as well as knowledgeable about the menu and different wines. I have also really enjoyed the food. My first time here, I had the risotto of the day which was fantastic. My friend tried the mussels and loved them. I have also tried the steak tartare and the steak frites; both were delicious. \nI have tried to go to brunch here a couple of times but unfortunately the wait was about 45 minutes every time. I believe they take reservations for brunch so I may have to try to do that some weekend.", "author": "Molly H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-31", "description": "What can I say..the food was great,I got the duck that was reccomend by other viewers...the only downside is my cocktail wasnt all the way fill...btw make reservation,you get seated right away,even on holidays..", "author": "Lillian H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-16", "description": "Nice French bistro with exceptional service and great food at reasonable prices.

We were disappointed.\n\nThe seating is far to close, with two booths for four people approaching ridiculous in terms of the space they offer (or actually, don't offer).  We found the service to be borderline rude, as they would not seat us at the table of our preference, despite the fact that there was plenty of space available.  The food is good but expensive for what it is, and same goes for the wine list.  The red wine was served way too warm and we had to ask them to refrigerate it for 15 minutes before it was drinkable.\n\nAll in all, considering the other dining options available in this part of Brooklyn, whether on Atlantic Avenue or Smith Street, Chez Moi does not deliver good value.", "author": "Michel D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-31", "description": "I'm SO SO SO happy that I live around the block from Chez Moi.
