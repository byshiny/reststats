Obviously, this kind of publicity makes it a bit of a tourist trap, and it shows. I am rating it at one star because of the service received. \n\nDue to a lengthy wait we decided to order take out instead of eating in. The problem arises when you're waiting, first for the 20 minutes that you were advised it would take, and then for another twenty minutes. My wife went inside to ask for the status of our order three times after the initial 20 minutes and was told to go away, someone would come outside once the food would be ready. \nOf course that never happened, and when I went to check in one more time our food was ready, wrapped up and just waiting for pick up. \n\nMy complaint was met with 'no one came to look for this! It is still warm, and won't get better if you stand here shouting at me!' (those who know me know that I am far from shouting, ever). \n\nWell, so we took our like warm pizza. \n\nIn terms of the food: Yes, the pizza is okay, but unless all you've had in your life is Domino's, then it's also nothing special. Any pizza in Europe that comes from a proper oven has this beat, and there's also nothing new to it in terms of concept (such as for example Chicago's deep dish pizza, which is original). \n\nOverall, pass this place.", "author": "Oliver S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-29", "description": "By far my favorite place to eat for pizza in all of NYC. It's always fresh and the staff is always phenomenal! You know you're gonna have a great pizza if you see Grimaldis! It doesn't leave you feeling like you've just eaten too much either. It's a very light pizza. Keep it up!!", "author": "Jonathan J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-14", "description": "We came a long way to get here.  Visiting mid-town  NY family, we were down at the Trade Center memorial in the sub-freezing temps when I decided I wanted to try historic Neapolitan pizza ( real Italian style).\nMy family obliged and we all took the Metro (little ones and all) down to DUMBO to Grimaldi.  \n\nMy sister knew that lines form outside so when we approached and there was one person outside she was worried it was closed. Thank God the cold kept the huge crowds away.  The guy at the door took us in right away.  One thing, the stroller would have to stay out in the freezing cold.  We did a quick job or taking valuables out of the stroller but had to leave it out there near the door guy.\n\nServers were nice.  No frills place settings, paper plates and such.  That was fine.  We got three large pies for a group of 6 adults and two kids.  It was just enough for hungry appetites.  The pepperoni was best.  Good combo of spice in meat and mildness of the mozzarella hunks.  The olives were very briny which my sister liked.  I thought they were a little more briny than I prefer.  My least fav was the cheese, only because I felt like there was a scarcity of cheese hunks.  Order extra cheese. The dough made a great cracker thin crust with coal fire flavor.  It was my favorite part of the pizza. \nI would like to try Julianas next door next time to compare these two long standing institutions.  Thanks to my fam for bringing us here.", "author": "Anita T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-07", "description": "I knew I had to try New York Pizza and from the amount of reviews and ratings this place has, I figured I'd give it a try at least as a base.\n\nWAIT: You have to wait in line and then they call you up when your table becomes available.  For a weeknight at 8pm we only waited like 15 minutes.\n\nATMOSPHERE: A basic pizza parlor place, nothing fancy.  I could tell it's probably been around for a while the way it looked and there's an upstairs.\n\nFOOD: We got the red sauce pizza and the white pizza.  On the red sauce we put sausage and mushroom.  The crust wasn't soggy and it held it's own, crusty, crispy and thin.  It was pretty dang good.  \n\nThe white pizza had pepperoni and onion.  Also very good, lots of garlic so I was a fan.  Some people might not like the fact that it doesn't have tomato sauce, but I liked that.\n\nThis is definitely a traditional pizza place.  They don't have those \"premium\" toppings such as prosciutto or asparagus, goat cheese or pear etc.  So you have to make do with what they give you.\n\nTo be honest though, the thin crust pizza we have here is pretty comparable.  Again, maybe I didn't try the \"best pizza in NY\" but Bottega Louie and Pizza Mozza were pretty good too.\n\nOverall, good for a chain.", "author": "Brittany T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-26", "description": "The Brooklyn Bridge is an iconic landmark in New York. Nestled beneath this popular locale, Grimaldi's Pizza is an iconic landmark in itself. For decades, the Grimaldi family has been making pizzas that stand up to the best pizza in New York and Italy. Baked in a hand-crafted coal-fired brick oven, the pizza at Grimaldi's has a unique flavor, perfectly crisp crust, and outstanding flavor.

But, for a quick day trip to NYC from Jersey, this was perfect! The pizza was delicious and very reasonably priced. Luckily there was no line and we were seated right away. Service was friendly. Cute , older building , sat upstairs on second floor.  Located up the street from the pier , we followed up pizza with ice cream under the bridge at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.  It was a fun afternoon and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting a good Brooklyn pizza!  Only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they don't serve fountain drinks, only bottled soda and Snapple, I spent more $ on 6 drinks than I did on the pizza.", "author": "Dawn G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-08", "description": "I love how this pizza place is ran.

You go to Grimaldi's for some pizza, then you walk back across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan. After about 50 trips to New York, I finally got around to making this pizza pilgrimage. And I wasn't disappointed, but it wasn't really revelatory either. The restaurant is right on a corner just a couple of minute's walk from the bridge. We got there about ten minutes before noon on an Friday, which was a stroke of luck, because 15 minutes later there was a line outside waiting for a table, whereas we had walked right in. You can pick your own seat in this case. We got the small (which, trust me, isn't small--more than enough for two people) and added grilled chicken, onion, and sweet peppers. It came out a little lightish on the chicken and heavyish on the peppers, I thought. It was pretty tasty, with some nice char on the bottom of the crust, but the peppers were chopped too big and tended to overwhelm it. I pulled a few off and that helped. As for the service, it's what you'd expect--they take your order, they bring you your food, they collect the money (cash only). And don't even think about ordering a slice--full pies only, which I can't blame them for. Keeps the stock fresher. \n\nOne major plus is the proximity to the pedestrian entrance to the bridge. That's a really spectacular walk and it only took us about 25 minutes. It's just minimal exertion and well worth the effort.", "author": "Adam B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-03", "description": "If I could give this restaurant more stars, I definitely would.
