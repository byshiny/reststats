We heard about Grimaldi's and were excited to eat there, but with the long ass line and the huge CASH ONLY sign at the front door, we were reluctant to wait. Went next door to Juliana's where we were greeted and seated by Patsy Grimaldi himself, learned about his life first hand, and walked into a cute restaurant with good service. \n\nMargherita Pizza + Pepperoni was delicious!

Walking towards Juliana's we saw a long line outside, we were a little disappointed because we love to go out to eat during the week when most people are at work, but low and behold, the line of people waiting was for Grimaldi's, NOT Juliana's! We were seated immediately and asked the waiter for a suggestion. Main seller is the Margherita Pizza with toppings. We went with Margherita with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza is definitely great..was it the best all around pizza Ive ever tasted? no. The ingredients were perhaps the freshest I have ever had..someone tell me where they get their mozzarella because I'd love to have it in my fridge. With all the pizza spots in New york/Brooklyn you really have to make an impression on someone to have them come back to your place, and I would definitely go back. Its a good family dinner spot. My only real disappointment is those damn little glass bottles of diet coke/coke! I hate when restaurants charge so much money for a sip of soda. It's a pizza place, where's the fountain coke?!

It's not surprising, however, that Juliana's has the better (best in nyc in my opinion) pizza which has super fresh toppings and a great crust. The base is thin and well done as it should be, and the crust is nice crispy, chewy, AND tasty. \n\nOrdered TWO large pizzas using the margherita as the base; one with additional sausage with fennel and sweet onions on one, and additional meatball and shitake mushrooms on the other. \n\nOur server seemed either new or overwhelmed with the busyness. Don't care so long as I can have a delicious pizza.\n\nThank you, Patsy!", "author": "David P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-21", "description": "Perfect crust, delicious sauce, homemade mozzarella all baked in a coal fired oven, much, much better than the Grimaldi's next door!", "author": "Sahak D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-28", "description": "This is probably the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Frankly, it's the only place where I've had pizza that tasted exactly like it did in Naples. \n\nTo begin with, we have to talk about this place's history and its owner, Patsy Grimaldi. Yes...that Grimaldi. The 80 year old Patsy opened the famous Grimaldi's next door and actual sold it off to take a break. Just last year, he decided to come back to the Pizza-making biz and opened Juliana's, named after his mother. This amazing owner still runs the front and greets old customers. Patsy had the temerity to open his new shop right next door to his old shop, practically starting a pizza war. (There's been a spat of bad blood between Patsy and the current owner of Grimaldi's, and the current owner even tried to get an injunction to block the opening of Juliana's)\n\nThe pizza itself ranges from the traditional margherita to fancier creations with interesting toppings like truffle oil and broccoli rabe. A few friends and I split a large Margherita (the most Italian and traditional pie: basil, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) and the No. 4 (Tomatoless pie: sausage, mozzarella cheese, broccoli rabe, garlic.) Both were amazing. The sauceless pizza sounds strange, but it really brought out the flavor of the meat and the rabe. The margherita was simply divine and a great example of how less is more. Pizza can really just be 4 components and still be perfect. \n\nIf you're smart, you'll want to come to Juliana's. The lines are shorter, the service nicer, and the pizza just frankly better.", "author": "Dawei L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-17", "description": "Hubby and I waited in line for an hour to try the \"best\" pizza in NY. My expectations were high. I wanted to taste real NY pizza that is supposedly the best in the country. I was seriously let down. We had the classic marguerita pizza. There was hardly any cheese or sauce and it tasted pretty bland to me. Maybe it's my taste buds (doubt it, they've been good to me over the years) but I just wasn't impressed at all. I've had better pizza in LA (believe it or not). I think pizza preferences are very subjective and this one is just not for me. Won't be going here again.", "author": "S.

Thin crust, chewy and all the simple ingredients were perfect - just like I remembered it. Awesome, awesome, awesome.  The servers were great and checked in regularly!

The No. 4 was also absolutely delicious (especially the prosciutto), although not quite as inventive as the other pie. Prices are steep when compared to surrounding pizza places (specialty pies run around $30 each), but 2 pizzas ended up feeding five of us just fine. \n\nWe didn't get to experience the service or the line (which often gets a little long, I've heard), but the food certainly speaks for itself!", "author": "Quincy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-26", "description": "The pizza here is absolute heaven..

It's something special. We were in line to eat at Grimaldi's because we'd read about the reputation it has for some of the best pizza in NY area. However, I had to use the restroom very badly and the owner let me in to go to the restroom. It's too bad the place isn't big enough to let people wait inside on a cold evening. Basically, everyone waits outside until a table is free, then he lets you in. He runs a tight ship! \n\nHowever, as I was using the restroom, my boyfriend was discovering what really happened with Grimaldi's and the one just next door, Juliana's. It appears a bit of a family mess happened and the one next door (Juliana's) came to back to stake their claim in the family business. So, seeing that there was no line at Juliana's and being that we'd just walked all the way from the NYC side of the Brooklyn Bridge on a cold evening, the wait looked to be just a bit much. \n\nWe entered and it had a nice feel to it. Good Sinatra music (later Beach Boys), a nice big oven towards the back. The seats were a little close but in the big city, you can't ask for a lot of space. Real estate isn't cheap here! So, you're gonna have to elbow it! \n\nService was fine and friendly. We had ample amounts of water to drink down the pizza. The pizza was wonderful. We ordered the Margherita and that was it. It was very tasty and you want more, but we held off. \n\nIt was that simple. I may never know what Grimaldi's will taste like, but Juliana's was just fine in my opinion!", "author": "Kristen L."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Juliana\u2019s Pizza", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "19 Old Fulton St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/-zAVNXSKJDQNYZQYWbqNRA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185966700"}
