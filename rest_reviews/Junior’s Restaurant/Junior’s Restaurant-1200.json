We got one of each\n-yellow cake with choco frosting\n-cheesecake\n-german choco cake\n-strawberry shake\n-banana shake\n-pineapple ice cream soda\n-cheese fries\n\nAll four of us got financially molested though.  They included a lavish gratuity \"because it was after 9pm\".  Nevermind the fact that we were FOUR PEOPLE ordering stuff from a case, A party of 6, 8, 12, ordering dish after dish and dessert and many a beverage and coffee, and getting rolls and butter and coleslaw, THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND, tack it on.  Hell include the tip in the bill and expect even more!  But damn...why us?\n\nAll this cold waitress unable to communicate or use curteous language did was look at us and wait for our order.  Then she chases us down.  As I pulled out my bills I had well over a months salary for her in my hand.  I told her that the receipt area labeled \"tip\"  was \"the suggested gratuity, right?\" \"No it's on the menu, after 9pm gratuity is included.\" I'm thinking \"Where, underneath the part where it says 'Hey cops if you come in here on a Thursday night you can probably catch a drug bust in the kitchen.'?\"   So I gave her a five (overtipping her 3 dollars more in the process) and said \"Yeah here's for chasing us down.\" And by chasing us down I mean, continuing-her-laziness-and-calling-for-us.\n\nI'm not gonna front, I'm going back to Junior's.  The pineapple cheesecake is too good.\n\nBut I will get my tip back.  Come hell, high water or idiot restaurant manager.\n\nGratuity my bum.  I'm not thankful, you old bag.  \n\nAND DON'T THINK I'M CHEAP.  We tipped 90% the other day at Presidente.  That lady was busting her ass.

Yes, after my friend dragged me all around Brooklyn in search of Junior's, we finally found it.  (He was lost, not me.  I had never been there before, and he had.)\n\nYou gotta love places that specialize in desserts, especially when there's a special take out section for them too.  We grabbed a slice of Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake and Strawberry Cheesecake to go.  Walking over to Brooklyn Heights to enjoy the view, how can you not love sitting on a park bench eating cheesecake together? \n\nThe cheesecake was yummy and rich.

Must be extremely subpar standards, I suppose, because this place was in fact a dive. The dinner specials were quite a few notches down from mediocre.\n\nIt's too bad this place turned out to be a thumbs down, considering I always use to go here.. Quite frankly, its overpriced and overall is a horrible place to eat other then the cheesecake. Every dish seems so shabby, greasey, overpriced, and small.

Sure, I've had the cheesecake at functions before, and it is undeniably delicious. However, I was excited about the \"Junior's Experience,\" so my roommate and I brought her out-of-town relatives there for a Brooklyn Experience.\n\nWe had no reservations, and the place appeared to be packed. We weren't in a rush and didn't mind waiting. They quoted us a 30 minute wait, but I think it was faster than that. \n\nOnce seated, we were given a selection of PICKLED THINGS. This might've been my favorite part! There were pickled beets, cabbage slaw, and pickles. Also served were rolls and yummy corn bread. \n\nOur waiter was really great. He was super friendly, and gave us extra PICKLED THINGS because my roommate loves them.\n\nI ordered a \"sandwich\" called the Something Different. Something different, indeed! It was yummy, tender brisket, sliced thin and piled high between two POTATO PANCAKES. \n\nBy the end, we were so full, we had to take our cheesecake home!\n\nYUM. A great experience, a Brooklyn must-go. Go early, go hungry. Don't fill up on the PICKLED THINGS too much.

Well, it is truly a piece of perfection.  The filling is creamy and delicious with just the right amounts of vanilla and lemon.  Now the crust is the only area of dispute as Junior's features a soft baked cake crust, which may turn off graham cracker crust enthusiasts.  It's a difference I noticed right away, but it did little to detract from the pure pleasure of enjoying my slice as I strolled through the glorious Fulton Street Mall.

EVER.\n\nThe waiter, besides getting my order wrong (a cheese omelet with french fries and toast), decided to yell at me for pointing out that he didn't bring my fries, insisting that I hadn't ordered them (they come with the omelet). Really? yell at me? really? WTF!\n\nThen, for a gross bonus to his rudeness, when he finally arrived to refill our water glasses (after they'd been empty for half the meal), he reached over two plates of food and dripped the condensing water all over what was left of our badly cooked lunches, and into my somewhat decent coffee. NASTY. Now there were no more drinks. \n\nFor a striking death-blow to the ambiance, the waiters yell at each other across the restaurant floor, as if they are shopping in the fulton mall and not working in a supposedly decent restaurant. \n\nAt the end of lunch, instead of asking if I would like dessert, the waiter said, \"Are you done.\"\n\nDone. \n\nNo, jerk-face, turkeys are done, tests are done, PEOPLE ARE FINISHED.  I could feel my third grade english teacher rising like a phoenix from my heart, and realized, I'm never coming back here.  So I said, \"No, I've finished my lunch, and I would like to see a dessert menu.\"\n\nHere was the moment that the cheesecake could have saved lunch a bit.  Hell, it's why we came here.  Despite my wanting to walk out at this point, we ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake. It was good. Not amazing, not perfect, but good. It would have been better if the rude waiter hadn't decided to yell a conversation at the waitress on the other side of the room.  Really, is there a manager around? ever?\n\nJuniors, you are a disappointment to Brooklyn. \n\nYou are the testament of how atrocious service can destroy a meal, and how once great places degrade into shameful shadows of what they once were. You should fire your entire staff and hire people you can train. Start with this: never reprimand a customer when you get their order wrong, learn your own menu, don't reach across tables, if a water pitcher is condensing- wrap it in a cloth napkin or get another one, at the end of a course- ask the patrons if they'd like to see the menu for the next course, clear plates when the entire table is finished- not as each plate empties, and be nice, courteous, and polite to your customers, or they'll never come back.\n\n\nYou will never, ever find me at Juniors again.  Gross.

I really can not think of anywhere else in NY. Love love Junior's cheese cake. not crazy about cheese cake facory. These are the richest of all and maybe the best of all. And $4-5 a piece is worth bc you can not finish all at once and it will stay in your refrige for a week. So it pays off. God bless you if you are buying the whole cake to finish. \n\nDining experience - 3 stars. Dining in there, foods are great but I wish they clean waiter's uniform more.

How do you keep outdoing yourself? It's not as complex as Chikalicous', but the Strawberry Short/Cheesecake I had was CRACKTACULAR. It definitely tasted better than it looked. Upon first glance, I was asking myself how this could possibly taste good. The strawberry was fused into the cheesecake and the shortbread was on the side with the whipped cream on the perimeter of the slice. For $6.75, I thought this was going to be a definite fail. To my surprise, it was quite the contrary. This slice was nothing short of heaven. You HAVE to order this. Whomever thought of this genius combination should be given a medal.
