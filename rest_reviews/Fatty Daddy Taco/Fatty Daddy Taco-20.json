Usually it's pretty much similar tasting and I can't even remember the last time I had exceptional food from a place similar to this.\n\nThis was that one exceptional place. I had a steak burrito and my friend ordered 3 different tacos. The burrito was GIGANTIC. I don't even know how they rolled that thing up. It wasn't just the size that impressed me, it was really the flavors that I was blown away by. The tacos were just on point, especially the fish taco. The chips and guac were no different. Definitely top 3 guacs I've ever had. \n\nSuper fast service, friendly and welcoming staff. Absolutely recommend this place to others and I will continue to revisit.", "author": "Ian G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-30", "description": "I've only ever tried the Fish Tacos at Fatty Daddy and that is likely the way it will stay.  A fish taco needs three simple things to pass the taco test:  be grilled (never fried), solid sauce and a flavorful taco shell.  I've had at least 50 of these fuckers and have enjoyed every bite.  \n\nI also enjoy the music they play, which does not affect the rating but is worth noting.", "author": "Adam H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-01-23", "description": "I ordered three burrito steak bowls for my family, it was so salty it's inedible.

When I'm craving fish tacos (weekly basis), this is my go to spot. Two tacos come out to $9 and some change which isn't the cheapest but also not the worst considering I definitely get full off of it.\n\nThe fish tacos come on two soft corn tortillas. The fish is seasoned and pan fried. On top they put on crunchy cabbage, radishes and this flipping delicious red creamy sauce that probably adds 300 calories to the meal, but I'm okay with it because it tastes so good. I always get this to go and they serve a couple of lime slices on the side and some Cholula hot sauce packets.\n\nFood is made to order and comes out fast. As a former San Diego gal, I think this is the closest I get to the San Diego fish tacos I used to eat every Tuesday. Come here and you will definitely get  your taco fix!!", "author": "Alyssa W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-26", "description": "This place is my favorite taco spot. Let me tell you why. The tacos are very flavorful and they have a good selection of tacos like, beef, shrimp, chicken. (Can't find shrimp everywhere, don't know why). The prices are fair and the portions are good too. I got beef and chicken tacos and the guacamole and chips. Ugh!

I got the grilled steak burrito and the best way to describe it, like others have already stated, is like the size (and weight) of a brick. It was almost 9pm and I was starving but I wasn't able to finish the whole thing because it was such a big portion. However, I also got bored of the taste of it about halfway through. It was really bland because there was no sauce and had very little cheese in it. Had to add some of their hot sauce just to give it some flavor. Another thing: we placed our order for pickup online via seamless and got a confirmation from the site but when we arrived at the restaurant 30 mins later they said that the order wasn't ready yet?? I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that there was a glitch with the system but 30+ mins for a 6-item order for pickup at 9pm is kind of ridiculous.", "author": "Kevin E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-03", "description": "Quesadilla was fantastic!! Was in the neighborhood looking for something new to try. And this small shop caught my eyes.\nFresh chicken quesadilla was so hot that I almost dropped the 2nd half even though I spent more than 7 minutes on the first half already. The part has less stuffing was crunchy, and the opposite was so cheesy good. Some salsa on the side for refreshment between bites.\nShould ask for adding some jalape\u00f1o inside next time.", "author": "Nathan C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-02-27", "description": "Amazing food.

This new location was good but not at the same level. The place is cool looking. The wait staff was friendly. There is enough seating for a dozen people. I ordered three Tacos: Al Pastor, Carne Asada, and Chorizo. The food took a little bit but not too bad.  The Al Pastor was tasty, but the meat lacked in a deep nuanced flavor.  The Carne Asada was again cooked well but again didn't strike my tongue with anything special. The chorizo was crumbly, quasi cold, and not very appetizing.  Its weird that all three of my tacos had the same lettuce and bland green salsa.  I think I will just go back to the other location.", "author": "Leonard L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-03", "description": "I order Fatty Daddy all the time and am never disappointed.
