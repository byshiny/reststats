They have Du Donuts, and also non-Du Donuts (which are significantly cheaper). You can also get a free regular donut if you check into the Food Park on Yelp!\n\nThe latte I had was good, the Boston creme donut was good. Staff was friendly. Pretty empty all around, but a few folks inside.\n\nThey also have an ice cream station.

I opened up the premade microwaved food and there was no sign of anything resembling my order. Premade foods that get reheated when you're expecting something fresh is not what you expect from a food hall. If I wanted that I would've gone to taco bell. They were nice enough to refund my order, but it was a waste of time that I didn't have.", "author": "Alyssa L."}], "servesCuisine": "American (Traditional)", "priceRange": null, "name": "South Congress", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "345 Adams St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mhwyN1fa2fD-efOsSU1OAA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": ""}
