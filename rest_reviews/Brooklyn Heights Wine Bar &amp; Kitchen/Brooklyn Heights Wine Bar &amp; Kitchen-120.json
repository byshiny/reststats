We went in the middle to late afternoon, so the weren't many other people there and it was quiet. We split a bottle of rose, and it really hit the spot with it being nearly 90\u00b0 outside. We also split the three cheese tray, with the baguette, walnuts, and honey. It was all delightful. My friends I sat around and chatted for nearly 2 hours. The woman who seemed to be running the serving show was very pleasant and attentive. Even after we had finished up and taken care of the check, we sat around and talked for a bit more, and she came back and gave us more water. She didn't have to, but she did, and it was a very nice gesture.", "author": "El L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-04-09", "description": "Friendly staff but less than mediocre food.

Their wine selection is fabulous and reasonably priced.  I am very very picky about my wines (to the point where I usually will not order wine except at the best places and settle for beer).  I've never had a wine here that I didn't like.\n\nTheir burgers are just great.  Probably the best burger I've had at a place that humbly offers burgers and isn't a steak house or gourmet restaurant that prides itself on its burgers.  The bun is just the right amount of tough/crispy while being soft enough you can bite through it easily and the burger is always cooked perfectly with just the right amount of salt for my tastes.  \n\nTheir white bean crostini is also super tasty and I've never had a small plate there that I was disappointed in.  \n\nIf someone offers me a free meal at a \"fancy\" place nearby or this, I'll take the fancy place, but if it's this or a nearby ale house or other pubs, I'll take the BH Wine Bar hands down.", "author": "Dave M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "I'm in the neighborhood and went in. The food is good but the service seriously needs improvement. I had to ask for service when I came in, and I had to ask twice for what I ordered.

The place is very relaxed inside. It was pretty empty when we arrived, around 7, but then as the night got going it did get crowded and a bit loud. Nothing horrible though.  \n\nWe had a bottle of wine and the cheese plate and both were amazing.

The wine list was well-organized, and I thought they had reasonable prices and selection. Our waiter gave fair suggestions when asked, and the wines were good across the board.\n\nIt took a little while for our drinks to come, and our waiter was by no means overly attentive, but we enjoyed sitting in the front window and absorbing the atmosphere.\n\nI would definitely stop by here again if I'm in the area, and maybe give the food a try.", "author": "Kerry C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-07", "description": "(Preface:  This place is on my \"Two-Week List,\" in which I list the top twenty restaurants and bars that I'd go to if some soothsayer came up to me and told me that I only had two weeks to live.  Check out the full list on my profile!)\n\nI used to live two blocks away, and I kid you not, being close to the BK Heights Wine Bar was something that helped make my decision to move there.  (I thought, \"It will be my new Ost!\")  And to this day, it's what I miss the most about living in Brooklyn Heights.  \n\nThe place is just so freaking adorable.  Corner windows, quaint sign, candles on the table.... such a good place to bring someone OR to just bring yourself and your New Yorker.  The wine list is HUGE, and Brian the bartender (LOVE HIM) knows so much about all of them.  Dinner is great, too, but whenever I come here I want to get all kinds of little things. I also love having my wine paired with the various meats, cheese, and pates on their menu.  \n\nThe place feels classy, and it is.  But that doesn't mean that you'd feel out of place in jeans and Chucks.  So it's classy but comfortable.  When people say that there's nothing to do in Brooklyn Heights (or even DUMBO, given its proximity), I always direct them here.  Really worth it.", "author": "J.

Ordered the mixed cheese plate, followed by a bottle of Pino Noir. My bleu cheese/baccon burger was up next and was probably the best med-rare I've had in a long time. Everyone else enjoyed their meals. \n\nI know at some point there was another bottle of red, did we order dessert? I know the arcade fire album was on repeat, it played at least 2 times.

Small wine bar, but had this cozy atmosphere.  We were given a fantastic table in the front of the restaurant with all the windows.  The inside was paneled with old dark wood.  Not a huge spot, but very cozy and cute. \n\nWe ordered a three-cheese plate, Butternut Squash with cr\u00e8me fraiche (rich), Firecracker Shrimp (small portion but yummy), mushroom ravoli with a pesto cream (yum) and a veggie plate which included goat cheese polenta and a variety of veggies (beets, portabellas, butternut squash, artichokes and some root veggies).

I was so disappointed with BH wine bar.  Despite the lovely location and quaint ambience on Henry Street, the service was beyond poor.  I had to wait for over fifteen minutes to get my check as the wait staff mysteriously disappeared in the back.  I don't think the staff smiled once which was oh so rude..especially for a single woman eating alone.  Where's the love? \n\nThe corn chowder was thin and the cheese plate was sub-par.  One would do much better going to the recently opened wine store on Montague, getting a slice of pizza from Fascati's (can you say hmmm, mmmm good?) and enjoying the view down on the promenade without the hassle of this joint.  \n\np.s.
