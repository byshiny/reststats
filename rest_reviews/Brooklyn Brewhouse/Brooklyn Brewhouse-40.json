I had just run the New York City Marathon, so I wanted to eat something that was as close to the hotel as possible with minimal walking. The restaurant was somewhat narrow and long. There were several TV screens at the bar and a couple of big ones all around the restaurant. It was a decent place to catch the World Series game. I started things off with a bottle of Brooklyn Oktoberfest beer. I got the Guinness Burger for my meal. Service was decent, although it wasn't crowded when I was there.\n\n*Guinness Burger*\nThe taste was good, but I was a little disappointed with the size of the burger. It could've been that I was really really hungry, but I could've easily eaten 3 of those. I got the burger with a side of mixed greens salad.\n\nOverall, it was not too bad considering how conveniently close it was to my hotel. However if my legs were working better, I'd probably walk to some place better.", "author": "Emil C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-25", "description": "Was staying at the hotel and wandered in to the Brooklyn Brewhouse at 8:00 on a Thursday. Immediately a waitress seated me and asked if I'd like something to drink. Place was about half full but the service was super fast. My drink showed up in under 3min. Even mix of after work people and young couples. Lot of good music that came close to drowning out conversation but somehow\nIt just made it more comfortable. Ordered a steak salad that showed up about 15 min later. It was good. Not amazing but good and I would easily order it again. This place is solid choice.", "author": "Ralph G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-30", "description": "Came here for food on the recommendation that they have really good burgers.\n\nI got the Guinness Burger with Sweet Potato Fries. The fries costed an extra $3 but I thought they were definitely worth it over the regular fries or salad. The taste of the burger was fantastic as it has this unique flavor I had never tasted in a burger before. The fries were also amazing and they gave a lot for a side.\n\nNo comment on the drinks because I didn't have any, but great burgers!", "author": "Jacky C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-22", "description": "Where do I even start..... If I could give this place 0 stars I definitely would. As soon as we walked in the vibe was just off. The staff was a bit rude and did not look pleased to be assisting me or any of my friends. I ordered the Brewhouse burger, since I was starving and cup of henny on the rocks with cranberry. As soon as I got the drink it immediately tasted like gasoline (fake liquor). Because of this I just decided to get a sprite. You can't go wrong with soda. Anyways when I got my burger and began to eat it I noticed a STRAND OF HAIR on my burger meat. I was shocked being that I heard so many good things about this restaurant. It was definitely not my hair because I have light brown hair and the hair in the burger was black dark hair. When I asked the waitress to speak to a manager a woman by the name Veronica came by and asked me what was my problem. When I told her she said that there is no way she would serve me a burger with hair and even if the hair was from the Restaurant I would still have to pay for it because I took a bite. Are you JOKING?! as she walked away she rolled her eyes and sucked her teeth. Being that I'm not problematic I just decided to pay for something I DID NOT EAT and leave peacefully. I do not recommend this to anyone. This place sucks. Hopefully they can get their health requirements up to par as well as management.", "author": "Charlene P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-05", "description": "Meh.

Bartender had poor communication about prices and was cheap on the pours. Management was completely inflexible and lacked a human response to our complaint.

Definitely satisfying, which at $14 for two it should be in my opinion. I also got to taste the wings (cooked perfectly), shrimp cocktail (leaving much to be desired providing about 5-6 shrimp per serving) and the Steak Taco which was awesome too. The drinks are strong and reasonably priced. We did not have any of their specialty cocktails.\n\nService was plesant and quick. We had Cassandra as our waitress both nights we visited from across the street where we stayed in the Sheration Downtown Brookly. \n\nLocation - Couldn't ask for better you are near both the Jay Metro Tech and Hoyt Street subway lines. It's downstairs inside the Indigo Hotel for those lucky enough to just catch the elevator to your room. Duffield in a one-way street with lots of construction, however I found it easily never visiting that location before.\n\nAmbiance - Friday it was sort of slow, but I blame that on my tiredness. The music was decent. Saturday, the music was a bit more lively and there was a larger crowd - thankfully that didn't stop the great service. The DJ danced with the crowd - made up of mostly young professionals 25 - 35 along with guests of the hotel which ranged in age. \n\nWe would definitely go back - its very convenient and I really enjoyed the service most of all.", "author": "Hsia F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-25", "description": "Had a really nice breakfast and late night nosh here as we were staying in the Indigo recently as we had to travel to the BK for a wedding.\n\nLate night, after the wedding when we made it back to the hotel, we heard the DJ and still in party mood, we stopped for a light nosh and final drink and listened to the tunes.  (All reggaeton, lol)  The tacos, street style, were decent - good flavor, and the corn tortillas were pretty good and presented well in a taco holder.  Fiancee had a burg (Forever eating burgs) - and it had a great char grill on it, smokey, and he wound up almost finishing it.  Fries were let down, limp,not crispy.\n\nDrinks were poured stiff, and we enjoyed the atmosphere and felt comfortable that the joint was attached to our hotel, so after we finally decided to call it a night we were able to safely retreat through a side door into the hotel and up to our room.\n\nFiance got a package deal with the hotel for 2 free breakfast ($35 worth) for the next morning.  What a great deal, as we ordered food to our content, plus morning beverage - great to sop up the prior evenings shenanigans.  The omelets were fluffy, french toast tasty but the breakfast potatoes weren't that great.  Too much oil and paprika....way too much that the oil ran all over the plate.\n\nService was good each time, friendly and just attentive enough.\nThe music level though, was through the roof - but thankfully when we got into our room we couldn't hear it/blended into the backdrop of city noise.  \n\nI'd eat here again if staying at the Indigo out of convenience.", "author": "Jennifer J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "Pleasantly surprised by this place - it was delicious.

Cocktails were generous and crafted well. Beer reasonable with lots of choices. And again - the staff! We had the pleasure of meeting Jeanet. Just wow!
