I am Dominican and one of the pickiest people in the world and to me this is the best home-cooking-style Dominican food that I have tasted in New York!.. Starting from their beans to their brisket special they are both great!!!!!! \n\nThe portions are huge for the price that you pay. $7 dollars straight for baked chicken, rice and beans lunch special. Brisket, Fish or any other choice will be $8 or $9 max $10 no more than than. \n\nGo to Los Papi's for lunch or breakfast, which is also delicious! They have sandwiches and Egg Any Style, but who is going to order that we you can have Mangu with los tres golpes (fried eggs, salami, and fried cheese) come on!\n\nKeep it up papis!!!\nYou are the best!!!", "author": "Jose J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-19", "description": "This was close by to where we were staying during our visit. On the last day prior to our departure we decided to have lunch here based on the reviews on Yelp. \n\nThis is a local hole in the wall with a B rating posted outside of their shop. Sometimes the better foods come from places that aren't rated A for cleanliness. We ordered the Cuban sandwich and their baked chicken meal with rice and mashed potatoes, and a side order of fried plantains. \n\nThe Cuban sandwich is the real winner. They really load the sandwich up with pork. Portion size is enough to share between two. The bakes chicken was good as well but the breast piece was on the dry side. The rice was decent, had some flavors. The mashed potato was disappointing as it lacked any flavor or seasoning and was only served on its own. The fired plantains was also kind of disappointing as it didn't taste fresh from the fryer. \n\nThis place is kind of off ways for most people as there's not much around the neighborhood. I told my friend to check it out but he said they don't open on weekends. If you're around for lunch I'd recommend giving their Cuban sandwich a try. It's cheap, service is friendly and the Cuban is worth getting.", "author": "David Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-11", "description": "I'm only reviewing the Cuban sandwich which deserves 5 stars on its own (I haven't ordered anything else from this place).

The man of men type cubano. I ate it and was afraid of it to end. The pork was great. Each bite had a mix of the crispy skin, lean pork, fatty moist pork, light creamy mayo, cheese and pickle . I was in heaven. I would definetly come back. Ambiance is like an old cafeteria but who cares. I'm there for good food. I also ordered the pork plate with plantains and avacado. I ate that as well!!!! I'm glad they didn't salt the meat so you can taste the meats natural flavor. I get to choose with salt or not. Got home and sprinkled some himalayan pink salt on it and bam!!!

The flavor in that dish is unreal and out of this world. \nChicken is a little dry but still delicious.\n\n4) if you like spicy, get the spicy dish.\n5) Say yes to plantains\n\n\nGet it to-go and head to Brooklyn Bridge Park - Main St. Sit down on the steps facing the amazing view and enjoy!", "author": "Brad P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-05", "description": "I have been ordering from \" Los Papi's\" for quite some time.

Best deal going anywhere in the 5 Boroughs. It's basically the sistership of OASIS on Bedford in Williamsburgh, except way better.\n\nIf you go, make sure you get the Cuban.

I don't know if he spoke any english, but I got what I needed anyway. He probably has had plenty experience since the place has been around since 1985... \n\nI didn't get anything off the menu-- they have rotating specials, so I definitely recommend that. I got the oxtail with rice and beans.. Amazing! The meat was so tender that I fell right off the bone. It was very flavorful and it doesn't hurt that it was only $8 for such a large portion of food!

It is so good to see you!\"\n\nHard to feel unwelcomed here at Papi's. Everyone we encountered was super friendly and seemed to enjoy what they did. The restaurant is very clean with a buffet type bar up front where an employee will scoop up there food for you. \n\nThe wife and I had an enchilada and a vegetarian wrap. Both were good and Mexican-American tasting (not autentico). You won't leave here wanting more food that is for sure but you also won't say that was the best meal of your life. \n\nOverall, food was 3 stars and customer service and restaurant cleanliness were a five.
