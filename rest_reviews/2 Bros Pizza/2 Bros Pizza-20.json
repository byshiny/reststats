It will do. You are just hungry. \n\nYou don't really crave this unless you are drunk or starving... or both. Premises are not the cleanest. Lines moves fast - so make sure to locate the condiments that you want while you are still on line because you will want to be in and out of there quickly.\n\nHave your dollar ready, get you slice and get out. \nHowever, I'm probably not coming back. Sticking to the St. Marks \u0026 W4th locations. \n\n* Dollar pizza does not discriminate but some people that frequent this place might. \nYes, you will find some real dirtbag sh*t nugget here that will keep yelling \"ni hao\" at you just because are an Asian girl.

I don't know if the whole pizza was basically cheeseless, but there was barely a sprinkle on my slice. I'm not sure why they even served it to me. I should have gone back from a different slice but I left the store before I noticed.\nThe ambiance: The store was playing bass blasting trap music so loud the tables were shaking. Employees talking to each other had to scream to be heard. Everyone ordered their pizza to go probably because they wanted to avoid tinnitus.\nOverall, this store is the scourge of NYC dollar pizza pantheon. Skip it and check out the other dollar slice joint a few streets away.

Paid $60 for 4 large pies.\n\nWe ordered 4 large pizzas (1 cheese, 2 pepperoni, and 1 veggie) from here because we were looking to feed a group of 6 for cheap. Since the slices are so cheap, we expected the pies to be on the cheaper side, but it was more expensive than the 4 large pizzas we had ordered from papa john's the week prior and for much less quality pizza! Also, the veggie pizza was just a bunch of broccoli and cheese. I would look elsewhere to order large pies.", "author": "Cecily S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-12", "description": "Downtown Brooklyn needs more places like this.

Maybe it's under new management? Anyway, I tacitly withdraw my previous review. This 'zza now doesn't emerge from the oven, black and scorched anymore.These pies are now decently pleasant to munch. More like 'regular pizza' served everywhere else. And I must admit that it is a boon to get a whole entire pizza pie for just $8 flat. Not even any tax. So, the quality of the pie now makes fiscal sense. This bargain is worth it at last. Whatever issues remaining with the taste of these floppy slices, can easily be covered up with a handful of oregano, garlic salt, or chili flakes from the canisters on the counter.

You get what you pay for, but definitely better than most dollar pizza spots. 2 slices and a coke was a great deal for me and a homeless friend. With only 7 bucks between us we did well. decent pizza and fast service. wouldn't recommend eating in there as it's hot as hell but it's beautiful to est in the park outside.", "author": "Dmitriy U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-20", "description": "This place is FILTHY!!!  Bums come in to fish the trash for bottles and cans and the tables are disgusting. We had a server who was sooo rude.  When we asked that our pizza be warmed.  She stated it was already hot.  We asked again and she threw the pizza in the oven and did not take the rest of our order.  When we spoke to the manager about it he just nodded his head and continued to knead dough.

I refuse to degrade myself with McDonald's anymore, so when I need cheap fast food that tastes okay enough to finish, I hit the one-dollar pizza joints. This pizzeria and college-student trap near LIU and Metrotech is good enough. The cheese barely covers the sauce and dough, but who cares when you need to fill your belly?

The lack of a posted menu was disturbing, however, when we asked the woman running the register how much it would be to add a topping and she replied, \"24.\" We inquired again, and she repeated, \"24.\" She seemed bored and possibly high, and frankly, I find it difficult to believe it costs $16 to add a little pepperoni to a cheap cheese pizza.", "author": "Patricia J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-05", "description": "First couple of bites when your're hungry feels like you're eating god-sent goodness.
