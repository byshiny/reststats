Delicious looking pastries, good coffee, and sufficient seating. \n\nMinus one star because their sandwiches aren't made in house, yet they take a bit too long to prepare (reheat). \n\nThat said, it's a lovely spot to sit and chat with a friend, read a book, or do some work (though no wifi).", "author": "Willa T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-05", "description": "Coffee is great.

Trying to order something, while you're just ignoring me. This place has rude, or rather, indifferent people serving your incredibly overpriced coffee and pasteries.

They serve Stumptown coffee here, one of my favorites, in addition to a\u00a0variety of specialty teas, handmade Italian sodas and even Kombucha on tap. They also have a lunch menu and some pretty amazing looking baked goods (which I definitely need to try next time).\n\nI got a cappuccino, one of my favorite coffee drinks, complete with it's little Florette.", "author": "Katherine S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-27", "description": "Very good iced tea!

A friend recommended this spot to me and I can see why. The service was really friendly and the brew was perfect for a cloudy day.

Service started great and now is lazy. The hot sandwiches every time I come aren't available due to a broke oven. I ordered a cold sandwich instead, more bread than anything else. Portions are off. I ordered a glass of wine, @$10 dollars and it wasn't even a quarter full. A lot to be desired. Maybe they will go back to actually satisfying customers with great food whether it be hold or cold and good services", "author": "Matthes C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-14", "description": "Fantastic, properly done cappuccino.

Peets Coffee owns them), lame barristas can't be bothered to listen well enough to make an order correct.

It's just perfect in terms of taste. My fianc\u00e9 is very picky about cappuccinos but loved this one! And their almond lattes are perfect! I don't have to add anything. They have three locations and all are cute and nice people and fast as possible though they can get a little busy.", "author": "Alyssa H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "Dropped in for some to-go, but wound up sitting for a minute and soaking up the space.  \n\nSimple and somewhat fancy, clean and quiet.  The bathroom was easy to find and didn't require a key or code or secret password.  \n\nAlmond cortado was exceptional.  Not sure when baristas started steaming almond milk so well but it's much appreciated.  \n\nThey serve Stumptown Coffee but not at Stumptown prices - the same drink is $3.50 there.  Just sayin.  And, IMO, the cafe didn't vibe with the surroundings. I'd like to go to a spot that reflects the neighborhood's lived-in vibe instead of crisp whiteness.  Maybe some local art on the walls could make it seem like more of a part of the community.", "author": "Alanna B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-21", "description": "Great cafe.

For some reason their espresso makes my favorite lattes. Great bakery items (the chocolate and apricot croissants are amazing and flakey!) including Dough donuts. Solid breakfast sandwich and yogurt parfait. Just started serving wine and beer including shiner bock. \n\nOne negative: it's tiny!
