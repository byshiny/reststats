Is it worth the wait outside?  Yes. Yes it is.  Grimaldi's makes a terrific pizza, and I have waited outside to sample some of it more than once.

I'd suggest drinking too much cheap and decent Chianti out of your water glass, giving it back to the Italian fixture who mans the line, ordering sausage on the pretty exceptional pizza and grabbing a cone at the Brooklyn Ice Cream factory before taking in a view that is more first-kiss-worthy than any I've seen.

We've all lived in NYC six years or more and figured it was finally time to go to the proposed Mecca of NYC pizza. We orderend the margherita pizza, practically salivating with anticipation, and have to say it was a huge let down. The crust was great, but the toppings were not. I'm not Italian, but I have had pizza in Rome and fairly confident they would spit Grimaldis pizza out and throw it to their dogs. The sauce lacks the love required to make their pizza even remotely memorable, the mozz was not fresh and it's clear they skimped on the basil...Basil! The cheapest ingredient! Thankfully, I have several other pizza joints to select from, but now I know what I've been missing and it's nothing much.", "author": "Marguerite S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-05", "description": "Just one thing before I get started. This location got a \"B\" rating by the New York Department of Health \u0026 Hygiene. I was really shocked by that, but didn't notice until we got to the top of the line. \n \nMy boyfriend and I arrived at Grimaldi's around 3pm on Friday of Labor Day weekend. I thought that the line wouldn't be so bad because it was before 5pm on a weekday, but I was wrong. The wait was just over an hour (just as other reviews have mentioned). A man runs the line by maintaining a list of peoples seating requests - couple, 3 people, 4 people, etc. If you're going as just a couple, I would suggest making buddies with the couple standing right next to you. The seating is family style anyways and you will more likely than not jump a significant portion of the line as these tables were turned over much quicker. When we got to the front of the line at least 3 groups of 4 were let in before us. And by the way the man is quiet salty so nothing makes waiting in that line more annoying that his constant demands of moving back and tightening up the line like your cattle. I suppose that might be part of the New York experience for the tourist, but to me he was just a cranky old man. \n\nNow to the actual pizza. We ordered one plain large pie (8 slices). (FYI: No ordering by the slice - cash only.) The slices aren't huge and trust me you'll be hungry when you get there. My initial reaction was that the cheese is was tasty and every piece of basil I had made the slice taste amazing. Although I stand by that statement, I think my initial reactions may have been due to my starvation upon arriving. As we continued to eat we noticed the pie was extremely doughy. When we looked at our slices closely there was no char on the bottom at all. We looked to our left and another couple's pie was cooked more thoroughly. I'm guessing our undercooked pie was the result of either the fact that we had no toppings (no extra cooking time) or that they just plain rushed it out to turn over the table.   \n\nI chose 3 stars soley on the pizza. You can get much better almost anywhere else, won't have to wait an hour, and won't have to be treated like cattle. \n\nOne last thing - they have opened up a location in Garden City, NY. I went there with a friend and the experience was much more enjoyable. We walked in and ate at the bar. They have a nice happy hour special of beer and personal pies and those pies were cooked much better. I think the Brooklyn location is overwhelmed by its popularity.", "author": "Nicole S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-05-29", "description": "Maybe there's better pizza out there but I haven't found it. Best darn pie I ever had until I went to DiFara's.\n\nYou really honestly can't go wrong with a day walking across the Brooklyn bridge (figure it's a 20 minute walk from City Hall),  and getting in line to get pizza here. Just about at all times there will be a line, but it won't take too long if you come during the day on weekdays. Nights and weekends? It could be a while, an hour to an hour and a half.\n\nI'll leave the details of the pizza to the other Yelpers who have it well covered but I'd advise caution before having olives on your pie. It's not that the olives aren't great quality, they are, but their natual saltiness can be a bit overwhelming. Also, if you get extra cheese you won't regret it.\n\nIf you have some extra room after you've had your pizza, split a canoli.

It's not at all bad, but it is no more refined, better-prepared, or gourmet-tasting than my neighborhood pizza joint. \n\nDo not order olives as your topping, because you will be getting the cheap awful kind that consists of black substance, unidentifiable in texture and consisting almost entirely of salt.", "author": "Anna A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-14", "description": "I've had John's, Lombardi's, Nunzio's, Patsy's, yeah, all the places people say is the best pizza in NY, and thus, arguably, the world.

I mean, the place is jam packed, there are always tons of people in there, people are all loving the food, and if you're a loud group, sitting next to another loud group, makes you feel like you're at a neighborhood bar. One time I was standing around, waiting to get to the bathroom, and one of the owners looked at me with that old Italian mysterious squint of his, called me over and told me to follow him without telling me what was going on, (honestly I thought I was in trouble, I had no idea) past the kitchen, to another bathroom no one was using.
