The general tso is absolutely amazing and so tender yet so crunchy. Everything here is amazing. You ever wonder why it's called Chinese takeout bc Chinese takeout is American.

Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in the area. Usually we get the general tsao chicken, and kung pao shrimp.

It's just awesome and it's the cleanest Chinese takeout joint I've ever seen in New York City. It's family-run and they take so much pride in what they do and it shows. My usual order is General Tso's chicken with pork fried rice, an egg roll and two Dr. Peppers.\"\n\nWhat more needs to be said?", "author": "Ned H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-19", "description": "The food here is amazing, and it's a great deal.  I usually order their lunch special and get 2 or 3 meals out of it.  The fried rice is amazing, and they have a nice variety of veggie dishes.
