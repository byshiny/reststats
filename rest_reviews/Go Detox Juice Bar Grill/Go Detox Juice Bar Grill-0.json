That's how badly fried it was. Don't ever get your breakfast from here.

The smoothies disappointed me because they sometimes tasted too bland or too watery, so I stopped getting them. The juices I got were never bad though. I personally enjoy the Arctic Zen and some Beet one.\n\nAnd yes, there are some people I trust to make my juice more than other employees, but the juices actually turn out good for me no matter who makes em.

From the first time I tried their green machine I was addicted!! Also, every single time I go their juice and service are consistently good. It's surprisingly hard in the city (or maybe it's just me) to find such a good smoothie/deli with reasonable prices, big portions, and fresh fruit but they've done it!\n\n Honestly I really hope it becomes those low key infamous hole-in-the-wall places because this place is such a feel good place I can't rave about it enough. If you're on some kind of juice diet and want to drink only orange fruit/veggies, if you're sick and need a hot honey ginger tea, they've got it. The colour also comes out surprisingly beautiful bit maybe I'm just biased towards green juice (faves are green machine and green tropical blast)\n\nTldr; you must travel to this small downtown brooklyn corner and try it if you love a good JUICE OR SMOOTHIE", "author": "Rose L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-02", "description": "This place offers smoothies along with wraps and breakfast items.

Between my roommate and I we've probably gotten close to 15 cups of smoothies and juices in that time and they've all been great. The lady who'd always been making the juice and smoothie that entire month has been so incredibly sweet and gets our order right every time (we also usually get one of the pre-set combinations straight of the menu) and we've loved it hence we kept going back. It had been come our go-to pick-me-up.\n\nBUT YESTERDAY (warning: long rant ahead) when I went to get juice, it was a new girl w reddish hair? which I'd never seen at the juice bar before. I wanted to try out a new combination (I always get the Arctic Zen) so I ordered the Kale Immunity (Kale, Carrot, Apple, Orange, Lemon). The girl repeated my order back at me correctly, and I saw her pick up and cut up a couple of carrots and apples and start to juice them, so I went back to texting a friend about plans later in the evening. About a few moments later, the girl held up a piece of ginger and asked me if that amount was ok. I was distracted and it looked fine to me so I just said sure that's fine. She juiced that and poured out all the juice into a cup and it was only when she handed me a drink (which was a murky orangey brown-ish color) did I pause because that did not look at all like the green I expected my KALE drink to be. I looked at my drink and back at the menu and asked her if this was Kale Immunity, and she said YES very indignantly. I asked why it wasn't green at all and she said it was cos the Kale didn't have much juice and waved a piece of Kale at me. I looked again at the drink menu then it hit me that ginger was not part of the Kale Immunity fruit list AND it looked suspiciously like she made me the Ginger Sparks drink (Carrot Apple Ginger), so I asked 'but you put ginger in the drink and it's not part of Kale Immunity..?' And she got angry and insisted that it was indeed Kale Immunity and that ginger was part of the fruit list for that (it isn't) and that she'd made it exactly right. At this point I was upset and tired, I'd just wanted to clarify and I'd been really polite to her but I didn't want to cause a scene because I genuinely really liked everyone else that I had met there, so I took the drink and just paid for it. The guy at the cashier was rly nice as usual, so that made me a little less upset. And to be honest I would've just been fine and taken the wrongly made drink anyway without a fuss (because these things happen and their juices are pretty nice anyway) if she'd just said she'd accidentally made it wrong and told me what it actually was instead of getting pissed at me for trying to clarify my confusion. I went home and tried the juice and the fruits were delicious as usual but it was DEFINITELY not Kale Immunity at all cos it was just sweet and spicy (the ginger) and there was no slight tang of the orange/lemon which all other smoothies/juice combinations that I've had with either of those had. I was having such a good day and this encounter and her rudeness really ruined my day.\n\nIt makes me so upset that I had such a bad experience and I'm never going back again if it's this girl at the counter even tho I rly rly love this place. Would definitely go in a heartbeat the original lady that was there the first month is the one making the juice. 0/5 stars for my experience yesterday, only giving it 3/5 cos of all the amazing experiences I've had before that.\n\nUpdate April 7 (2):\nWe walked past the juice bar today in the PM and it was the original lady (w the bun) on shift!! We got the Kale Immunity this time AND IT WAS GREEN w a hint of brown DEFINITELY NOT THE ORANGY-BROWN from yesterday, AND SLIGHTLY TANGY and so so delicious.
