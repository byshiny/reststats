Pedro's came up when i did a search for \"Best Margarita in Brooklyn\" and I felt seriously mislead.  Everything was more or less edible but just not good - The Elote is just strewn with Mayo and Pepper - the tacos (3 small) were a decent price at $8 but just MEH.  thankfully i doused everything in Salsa Verde (You get charged $1 for a small serving) No chips! No salsa!  Crap Food!

We found parking near Pedro's and decided to eat dinner here.  We are not experts in Mexican food but found the food good. The fajitas were  plentiful and flavored very well even though they were hampered by my request for very very mild!  The regular Sangria packed a punch that I can only wonder how strong  b Pedro's special sangria would be. Overall a fun evening. We appreciated the mixed crowd  in the sidewalk area. Lots of fun.", "author": "Lucille S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-20", "description": "I moved to the block a few months ago and thought this would become my after work go to place.  After three attempts at eating here, it is safe to say that I will never eat here again.  The place is a dive, but usually those are the kinds of places the best Mexican food comes from... not this place.  The food is not fresh here.  Portions are small and tasteless.  Even the chips and salsa are bad.  I figured they would at least have good margaritas.... not at all.  The servers, while nice, seem inexperienced and not to know anything about the food when you ask questions.  And indeed they do serve their food on styrofoam dishes.  I walk by everday and the place is always full which just makes me wonder how so many people could have such bad taste.  This place was such a gigantic let down.  I don't know how it has accumulated such a high yelp rating.  Like other reviewers, I'd rather eat at Taco Bell.\n\nIt is an abomination against Mexican food!", "author": "Amanda K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-06-21", "description": "Negative a million stars.

Ever. Food wasn't great, especially not at the prices they were charging. And to add insult to injury, the food wasn't even made fresh. While waiting for the restroom, I saw kitchen staff microwaving orders of burritos, tamales, plantains, pretty much everything on the menu. One after another dish kept going into the microwave before being served to customers. Ridiculous.

I understand that food options are limited in this area of Brooklyn, so if you must, you must.  The service was slow, the menu a bit unclear, and the fish tacos were a bit too \"fishy.\" The upside was the cokes were in bottles, and a graffiti outside it pretty bangin'.\n\nAll in all, don't go out of your way for a visit.

We walked in and I felt like I was in Mexico, haha. The ambiance here was energetic to say the least. It was Rosa who made it a special visit for us to enjoy. We started off with the Platano Frito fried plantains maduros, sweet, tostones, and salty with the sour cream on the side, next we ordered Chimichangas and Flautas (yes folks we were hungry haha!) than for dessert Rosa recommended the sweet carmel nachos! Now here was a treat! After a few margaritas I had to ask Rosa how the latin sour cream was made. At first she wouldn't tell me but after telling her that I was visiting from California she gave the secret to it....\nAll and all I had a great time at this little hole in the wall place!

We had passed it many times while visiting DUMBO, so the location is pretty great. Service was friendly, and the vibe once seated was quite nice. I would like to have a couple of drinks here if I ever find myself back.\n\nI had a Chicken Milanese Torta, which was pretty tasty \u0026 crunchy, however the bread/wrap left something to be desired. It comes in an aluminum foil wrapper, which is evidently required as the contents otherwise spill out all over the place. I think that I've been spoiled by the tortas at my local spot, Yolas.\n\nThe other entr\u00e9e that arrived was a set of chicken soft tacos. We ordered pork tamales, not sure how that simple order was crossed, but we sucked it up and just kept what was served. The place was not too busy, but we also wanted to be on our way. . . the chicken tacos were \"all right\", nothing of note to comment on.\n\nWe shared a glass of red wine sangria, it was quite nice. Overall, we spent $26 (including tip) - I think that was a little too much for decent \"fast\" food, incorrectly delivered, and not particularly flavorful. 3 stars for the location, vibe, and potential for drinking.", "author": "David B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-01", "description": "5 Stars for Tecate in a bottle, -2 Star for bad fish tacos.\n\nThe tacos are okay, not great, although I did really like the Chorizo taco. Fish taco tasted really really really fishy, I couldn't even eat it. Chicken taco was so-so. Empenada sort of sucked. Pedro's also smelled a little foul, not really into eating in a place that smells like what you might do after you digest their food. The only thing that saves this place is the bottled Tecate, which was great, really great.\n\nThe ladies are nice behind the counter, but fact remains, this is just a mediocre taco joint, I would travel further for better.", "author": "Gabe W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-05-15", "description": "The food is scary.

It's all subjective, I know, but it seems like some had a expectations that simply isn't the mission of this restaurant. \n\nHere it is!

This ain't that.\n\nThey have all the usuals, and they're ok -- not awful, but just bland and nothing special and no place you'd ever go back to.

Could be C's, with a D for service. If it were cheap and generous, that'd be something else, but, again, you could probably do just as well, if not better, at (god forbid . . . and just a guess) Chili's. Pedro's actually heats things up with a microwave (which they don't hide), something they might well have in common with Chili's.\n\nOh, and they don't even give you free chips. What's up with that? About 90% or more of places like this give you free chips. Sheez.\n\nLast thing: the place screams, \"Fire Trap.\" I'm no nervous nelly, but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to open the paper some morning and hear about a dozen people perishing in a blaze in there.

So simple, but apparently so complex.\n\nThose 4 stars are for the margaritas.

I've pretty much tried at least one margarita from every Latin inspired restaurant I have been to in the last year, and Pedro's is the probably the best, and certainly the best for the money.

If it weren't so close to my house, I'd never set foot in the place. It's hard to screw up quesadillas and nachos, although you should request they not overdo it with the onions or black beans (which they have a tendency to do). The tacos are passable, and the service is friendly when it arrives. The beer is generally cold and they have a pretty decent selection given the single cooler. \n\nI've never had the burgers.
