The elegant surroundings are echoed by the style of the cafe - although it's on the concourse it is marked out by a ramp up to the area and fenceposts around.\n\n\n Coffee was hot and fresh. We ordered the Cherry Cheesecake and Carrot Cake Cheesecake - just a slice of each.\n\n\n What arrived was more of a mountain. The carrot cake slice was about as big as my head, and therefore most of it had to leave in a box with us, but it was so fresh, tasty and indulgent and most quintessentially Brooklyn cheesecake. YUM.\n\n\n The cafe also does hot eats (burgers, fries and the like) and a hugely vast range of cake slices, as well as cheesecake.\n\n\n A definite must to visit. It's awesome.", "author": "kateyay"}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "I know I may not be like most of the reviews from people who frequent Juniors but I have to say I am not all that impressed with this old-style NY deli/restaurant.

All I can say is it was an ENTIRELY different experience.  The service was prompt and efficient. The wait staff was attentive and helpful, almost too attentive.\n\nI tried \"Something Different\" and it was really quite tasty.  The side dish of beets were amazing.  \n\nThe cheesecake was really quite good.  It was the perfect texture and flavor.  I don't recall the type of cheesecake but it was the cheesecake inside a rich chocolate fudgy cake.  \n\nEveryone at my table enjoyed there meal and the service.  I would definitely recommend giving Juniors a chance.  Obviously I had two completely different experiences.  I know they are definitely capable of providing amazing food and service.  If you don't enjoy the food or service let the manager know and I am confident they will take care of you.\n\nI would give the second visit five stars, but I am still in disbelief it was that great of hospitality.", "author": "C.

My favorites are the combos -- red velvet cheesecake, devil's food cheesecake, carrot cake cheesecakes, chocolate mousse cheesecake. The kiddees also love their cupcakes. They are the old fashioned kind, vanilla cake smotherered with butter cream and sprinkles. You will not find lavender, green tea, or bacon on these cupcakes.\n\nI ordered their cheesecake and buttercream cake for a family event, and they were a big hit.  I can't say much about their food, since I usually come there just for dessert. It is also fun to sit at their counter (there's a small one in the front) and watch Brooklyn go by.", "author": "Maureen W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-07", "description": "There's only one reason to go here, as far as I'm concerned, and that's the cheesecake.

I went there solely to try their \"world-reknown\" cheesecake.  I have heard about Junior's Cheesecake for more than ten years and have heard their cheesecake has been famous for probably thirty years or more.  So this intrigued me that I had never tasted it. \n\nSo, I went there, took days to find a parking space (on the street, at meters).  (Park legally in this area or your car will be ticketed, towed and heavily fined and nearly impossible to get back.  Never had my car towed here but have heard the stories --true stories of others who have had the experience. \n\n\nRATING THEIR CHEESECAKE? \nI rate it a THREE (from one to ten, with ten being the best). \n\n(I think if I hadn't heard their unbelieveable reputation and word of mouth, I would have rated this a seven.  But I was expecting absolutely, great, tremendously, marvelous cheesecake but was served a \"pretty good\" cheesecake instead. \n\n\nThe cheesecake was definitely a huge disappointment to me.   They should clear out all those claims that Juniors has the best cheesecake.  \n\nJunior's has had a \"reputation\" (a good one) in our borough for many, many years. Though I had never been there until about 2 years ago, I guess I believed the reputation. \n\nFor more than twenty years, I've heard and read that Junior's has the best cheesecake around.  You can never believe what you hear but believe what you see and taste.  Believe what is before your very eyes.\n\nHere's how I rate cheesecakes in the United States of America: \n\n1.  Zins Diner (in Ephrata, Pennsylvania or near there). \n\n2. Linda's Cheesecake (usually sold in frozen department of any Pathmark. \n\n3.  Baby Watson  (sold in diners, candy stores and other places).  These are bigger than bite-size (like small cupcakes) and the taste and texture is great. \n\n4. Junior's Cheesecake.   So , why is Junior's number four and not number one?  This is for a few reasons, mainly these:\n\n5. Barnes and Nobles Cheesecake -- only the price was a disapointment   Taste is great but not many can afford it.  (Picture going in there with a family and many mouths to feed.  Cheesecake is out in that case. \n\n                     1.  Junior's reputation for its' cheesecake spoils the taste because you are going there just for the cheesecake and wow, what a let-down.  (Perhaps if the cake was cheaper, the letdown would be not so bad).  But for those prices and for that FABULOUS reputation, I expected so much more.  I expected to be WoW ed, expected to have my taste-buds tingled.  I expected to at least come away saying, \"WOW, now that was a cheesecake\".", "author": "Honest R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-18", "description": "I always liked this place even though the burgers are not that good anymore!

The food was good, but a lot to eat in one go. \n\nIf you get coffee, you get free re-fills. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant was good, with pictures of Biggie and Puff Daddy and other notable New Yorkers.

Ehh..  nothing real special to note here.  I had eggs and bacon.  There was a lot of fat on these bacons, I've had better.  The cheesecake was ok, pretty cheesy and sweet.

The place is nice looking and kept pretty clean.  Also the servers are super friendly.  However, I think their prices have become a little unreasonable for average tasting diner food.  Also the portions have been reduced over the past couple of years.  Their famous cheesecake does not taste any different than David's frozen cheesecake that you can buy in a supermarket.

No matter what anyone tells you if your in Brooklyn looking for good Cheesecake this is the place to be. You can either have it take out or dinning in or you can even get it shipped. I found out about this place while in Miami when a friend of mine shipped a Multi-flavored Cheesecake down to me for Christmas. It is so rich you can only eat a slice, I haven't found anyone able to eat more than one slice at one time. When I went to the restaurant to have a cheesecake to go, they have about 30 different flavors to choose from (depending on the time of year).  They also serve lunch and dinner so if your looking to just relax its a perfect place to.

Yet the place is in most ways utterly wonderful, and, if you live within regular striking distance, can be downright addictive.  (This I know from experience.)  \n\nFor people-watching alone, there's likely no better ticket in all of Brooklyn, and the old-school surroundings and waitstaff (tired, sure, slow, maybe, but infallibly polite and beyond charming, undoubtedly) are a huge part of Junior's seemingly inestimable charm. There's a wonderful, hushed sense of borough ritual and history here: the awe-inspiring old-school red neon sign outside, the giant cases filled with overstuffed cakes and cheesecake (that you'll never leave room for) as you enter, the small plates of pickles, slaw and rolls that almost magically appear on your table shortly after you're seated.  (Don't dare be a killjoy and refuse them.)\n\nThe menu and portions are huge (side salad w/choice of dressing, side potato, side vegetable, etc.) and the food is predictably comforting, salty, sweet and artery clogging, and, truth be told, not terribly good.  \n\nBut I almost never notice, really.  Four bites into my fried shrimp entree, I'll wonder if I can ever eat another bite of food, ever again, and the thought of a gargantuan slice of Junior's (decadent yes, lovable, certainly, but not really world-class) cheesecake is downright terrifying. \n \nOf course I'll suck it up, for the sake of tradition, and the chance to come back again.

If not, you're slacking. It is simply the best I've ever had and I've tried a lot of cheesecake. Only one time did I try better but that was homemade by an old lady on my block where I grew up.\n\nEating in here is a must at least once. It's not the greatest food but I never expect that at a diner. I don't do it too often though because I like the place.
