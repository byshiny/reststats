It was cute inside.  Although a little noisy, the volume was no problem for conversation.  Food was decent, fresh Thai food--nothing crazy.  Entrees were pretty much $7-$8 so our whole meal was extremely cheap and both of us have more than half of our entrees as leftovers.  The portions are very, very large.\n\nI am writing this review ASAP (was just there last night, and I have never been so punctual with a review!) is because as of very recently, they are no longer BYOB.  We brought a bottle of wine but then I noticed a wine list on our table and we hid the bottle as quickly as possible.  Then when another couple sat next to us, they did the same thing and were told you can no longer bring your own alcohol.  I was glad we weren't the only ones.\n\nWe went on a Monday night and we didn't have to wait, but I am pretty sure after we were seated there were zero tables left open in the restaurant.  I would imagine going on a more popular night there would be a wait.", "author": "Dana P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-28", "description": "Fast, friendly service and absolutely amazing Chicken Masaman Curry and Thai Basil Chicken.

My curry is full of weird tasting eggplant that's sliced too thick and carrots that are also sliced so thick they aren't cooked at ALL.  Did the veggie truck not show up today?

I will keep it as short as possible:. \n\n-A large plain salad with not enough peanut salad dressing. Check. \n-A poorly fixed Thai iced tea. Check. \n-Bland dishes. Check and Check. \n-An inattentive server who only stopped to ask us 3 times if we were done (big ups to the guy that filled up our water though). Check again \n-Our check instead of the dessert menu. Are you kidding me? Oh Check. \n\nOkay maybe I should have known to ask them for well-prepared and more flavorful dishes. Maybe they don't serve dessert and my plate with over 1/3 of my food left is a sign to National staff  that my plate should be picked up. Honestly maybe its me. All I know is I have never been so rushed to finish a meal in my life nor have I ever wanted to skip out on a bill. National took me there (don't worry they were paid and we got our dessert fix elsewhere). \n\nPerhaps I'm too picky when it comes to Thai *kanye shrug. I don't know but I figure someone on yelp should get this perspective. I can appreciate the convenience of its location however the food we had was lackluster, the service is abysmal, and there are tens of restaurants where I'd rather spend my money in the vincinity than here. Go at your discretion and I hope you have a better experience than we did. \n\nHelpful tips (see trying to be positive .... :-/) Bring cash as credit cards arent accepted and ask for your dish to be made spicy.", "author": "Kyndall P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-02", "description": "Well, I love Joya. So I like this place too.\nBYOB Friend! Saves you $$$$!!!\nPretty good Thai as Brooklyn Thai goes. Food comes out really fast, even when they are busy. I have never waited long for food which means people don't end up waiting too long for a seat either. Curry, yum, pad thai, yum, spare ribs....ehhhh.... kinda fatty.

The number of times I have eaten here in less than a year is not only shocking, but leaves the fact that I love to cook for myself in question. (I swear, I can and I do!)\n\nHands down, National is the best thai food I've ever had. While everything there is great, I always seem to come back for the same thing: a calamari appetizer paired with beef pad se yu accompanied by a BYO bottle of wine is a glorious combination of happy in my tummy. Plus, their prices are staggeringly cheap for the gigantic portions they provide.\n\nThe wait for a table is a bit long (20-30 minutes) Thursday - Saturday nights, but the food is so tasty, it's worth it. But remember: to fully enjoy your experience at National, BYOB \u0026 C (cash), as they don't accept credit cards!", "author": "Sarah M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-07", "description": "Delicious food and BYOB, does it get any better than that?\n\nPersonal favorite is Pad Se Yu (with beef) and the calamari (the sauce is the best part!).  \n\nIt's just about the classiest $7 meal you can get in Fort Greene.  The service is fine, just make sure you tell them you want brown rice when you order and not any time afterward!", "author": "Jenna O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-05", "description": "I'll preface this by saying: \n1) Among the many, many delicious dining options available in the 'hood, Asian cuisine is still largely underrepresented.\n\n2) I take noodles and flavor seriously.\n\nWith that said, I was more than excited to welcome Thai cuisine to the neighborhood. National is in a prime location and has a jammin' ambiance, perfect for a sultry date or summer evening dining outside.\n\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered the tom yum kung and pad thai. My tom yum was just OK. Decent and edible, by all means, but very much lacking that je nous se qoui you come to expect when you know the real deal. Nevertheless, the soup was hot and fresh, and that was that.\n\nThe pad thai arrives. Much to my dismay, the noodles are starchy and overcooked. Seriously, Thai people? You and I both know what the consistency of noodles should be and this ain't it. The flavor wasn't memorable, as good Thai food should be, but once I dressed it up w/the fresh squeezed lime and assortment of condiments, it was relatively palatable. But texture is fundamental for a noodle dish, obviously. And this hot, heaping mass was inexcusable. \n\nMajor disappointment.", "author": "Lans S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-26", "description": "It's not my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn, but it's my favorite place to get a quick bite to eat:\n\nLet me explain: \n\n-Silly cheap\n-Great portions\n-Every dish has been tasty every time I've been there\n-Get in and get out quick\n\nLove this place.", "author": "Adam D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-20", "description": "Good option for delivery.

I feel the Pad See Ew (my go-to Thai noodle) is indicative of the overall level of quality here: good, not great. It's just a little too salty, using a noticeably below-average grade of beef; on the other hand, it's only about $7 and is basically a godsend to the cruelly Pad See Ew-less world that was Fort Greene just two short months ago. The curries I've sampled, Panang and Masaman, fare a bit better, though the latter is curiously onion-free.\n\nNational also loses points for having a name so generic that it's actually a little confusing, though of course it gains those points right back for being a Thai restaurant but not having words like Lemongrass, Mango, or Thai in its name.\n\nSumming up: Cheap, well-located, and acceptable-quality food that still  leaves a reasonable amount of room for improvement. You've almost definitely had better Thai in your lifetime, but the chances of your having had better Thai in Fort Greene specifically are basically zero.\n\n*Note: \"Mango Thai and Mee\" sounds like the title of a terrible book, or perhaps a mildly offensive children's cartoon.", "author": "Galvin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-11", "description": "I work around the neighborhood and we frequent here at least 3 times a week out of the 5 day work week!\nIts that good!

I went to dinner with my good friend since I had dined here before during lunch time and enjoyed the good food and great portions. TONIGHT HOWEVER WAS TERRIBLE. Taya, my waitress, was not attentive.
