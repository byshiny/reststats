I came by here with a friend of mine to order a nice lunch. It took a good while for our food to come but whatever right? At least our food was there.\nSo we start eating and my friend says, \"what the hell!?\" And lifts her fork out of her meal, to reveal a long string of plastic, that was literally cooked into her food! So I'm somewhat humored and she's a little pissed. I say that they probably accidentally cooked in a plastic wrapping from a straw or something, as though that realization, would make her any less grossed out and unhappy with her meal. She flags the waitress, who is super surprised by said non-edible plastic and goes to the back to get her another of the same dish.\nA little bit of a wait again, her new meal arrives, she starts eating and says, \"you have got to be f*****g kidding me!\" And now she's pretty pissed and disgusted because there is another long, relatively thick sheet of plastic cooked into her meal again. This one even bigger than the one from before! Naturally I'm dying laughing and while she could see the humor in it, she was also pretty upset because while she was still hungry, she was understandably too put off to bother trying for a round three with her meal. She didn't even want to risk eating any of mine after that. The waitress luckily just removed the cost of her food from the tab because, Ugh lol.\nI'm giving this more than 1 star because I've ordered take out wings since then and at the very least, they tasted all right and also because what happened to my friend was somewhat hilarious at the time but still though pretty gross and messed up :/", "author": "Donald W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-10", "description": "Horrible customer service all 3 times I came in here.

Very sad because it used to be really good. It now looks dated, it's quite dark, with subpar service, watered down drinks and even the food was not up to snuff. Other than one lovely geeeter upon entering, the people at the door were hanging out. No hello, goodbye or anything. The place wasn't crowded, yet service was slow. I've never experienced such an awful time in an Applebee's. I hate writing bad reviews, but revamping \u0026 retraining needs to happen.", "author": "Dakeeta G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-25", "description": "Hmmm ok well it is Christmas and all but this is the Second time we have been there. The service was pretty slow but the worst part was that the general manager came to the table to drop off our food and when we complained to him he gave us some kind of stank face. After that we sat feeling awkward for a little while and then decided to try to smooth things over with him when we tried to smooth things over it seemed to make things worse, at which Point we asked ourselves why are we doing this at all in fact why do we come here at all? At the end of the day it is not the worst restaurant in the world but not one that we will be going back to again after the weirdness that we experienced today.", "author": "Eugene E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-06-16", "description": "Service is horrible.

So I told my son we had to leave but he was getting upset because he was hungry (I had just rushed him to the doctor for a fever, meds started kicking in and so did his appetite). The manager came over and said he would serve us breakfast it was not a problem. That really made out day and the food was delicious, our waitress was lovely too.\nOnly con was the hostess, if the manager so easily offered to serve breakfast then it probably wasn't a big deal. The restaurant was pretty empty and all the host had to do was ask instead of allow paying customers to almost walk out the door. Keep in mind I think it was 5 minutes after breakfast ended, it wasn't a far of time.", "author": "Shaniqua G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-19", "description": "I haven't been here in a minute! Food is still disgusting, but the bartenders know how to make a hell of a drink. I ordered a few drinks and the bartender was in top of everything. She was multitasking like crazy. I got to give it up to her. Manager came around to see if all of the guests were good. Also, another quality I did like was that the manager wanted instant opinions from his patrons. Pretty cool.

We sat the counter for over 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged at the bar. I was disappointed but I thought it was more of a management problem since I have a background in service industry.

I had to wait about 30 minutes for two easy meals, which was extremely frustrating after hearing another customer complain about delayed food service as well. Another problem was the quality of the food; NOTHING LIKE ADVERTISED. I was extremely disappointed with my Classic Clubhouse Grill sandwich which was supposed to contain \"toasted bakery bread.\" Yeah, that bread was more or less 99 cents' store fresh. Besides that, I also had a problem with my chocolate chip sundae, which came with a cold chocolate chip cookie (which made it hard to scoop with the spoon) and horribly placed whip cream and oreo cookie pieces. However disappointing the food and wait time was, the service was still okay.

They consistently have the worst service I've ever had anywhere. Multiple times they've charged me the wrong amount on my check ($54 for some nachos and a glass of water? REALLY!?!). Do not trust the employees at this place, as they're all incompetent. Clearly Applesbee's does not hold they're employees to any sort of standard.

You'd have a far more superior dining experience if you went to the $1 a slice pizza store a few feet away from this Applebees. You get the feeling that management is very hands off and the staff is not held to any type of standard. I've had two separate friends relate experiences where they saw actual fights go down between diners and staff. The last time I went against my best interest my lazy unprofessional waitress took almost 15 minutes to appear because she was too busy being thirsty and flirting with the table of men next to us..  When my boneless chicken arrived it looked as if it had been scraped into my plate from someone elses leftovers and the burgers were as usual undercooked. I knew from past experience that getting the manager wouldn't be of much use. Their Happy Hour is a joke, the bartender showed us it's just a mix of hardly any alcohol you are better off getting your own bottle.
