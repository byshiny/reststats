Happy hour on weekdays is 4-11pm. The drinks are nice and strong. Weekends are also a good time for post brunch for drinks too. \n\nI find their prix fixe to be delightful aswell. There is a small TV if you're trying to watch a game. The service is awesome (in my opinion) the times I have been here and Fan will take good care of you.", "author": "Horace S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-21", "description": "think there chicken witht he orange peel sauce is really good.

What a great choice! Our waiter, sorry I forgot his name, was super friendly from the beginning. My granddaughter was making conversation with him and he really was attentive. I enjoyed my mango mijito...both of them. The rest of my party also enjoyed their drinks as well...smiles all around. We all enjoyed our entr\u00e9es and really didn't have room for dessert but was given an ice cream sampler which the green tea was delish! Definitely will make this our go to spot when we come back to NY. I would of given 5 stars but towards the end of the meal, the restaurant got busy and our server got busy and less attentive.

In actuality it is probably a 4. Great happy hour  and great potstickers with an abundance of varieties!!! The manager Katie is amazing and remembers everyone's name and preference!

First time we had a great service: our waiter was very attentive, fast and on top of things, but second time around we had a different waiter, who seems to be lucking a lot of skills. We tried dim sum, lychee martini, sea bass, spring roll. Everything was fresh and delicious! I'm definitely coming back. I didn't give 5 stars just because WOOHOO and as good as it gets, according to my understanding of dining, more applies to the fancy upscale restaurants with $$$$. Otherwise I will give it a 5!", "author": "Iryna G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-01", "description": "Chance serves better dim sum than most places in Chinatown. The orange chicken called \"Chance chicken\" is a party, the happy hour is a great deal, the staff is very friendly and efficient and the decor surpasses that of every other casual Chinese inspired restaurant in the city.

It's in a nice intimate setting, not too packed on a week night. The music in the background is decent, yet you can still herself to have a conversation.

I had the prixe fixe for $28 dollars.  The tuna tartare rolls and filet mignon were done perfectly.  However, the banana mousse dessert was still halfway frozen.  The chance mojitos were an excellent paring of pineapple, mint and ginger and had a nice kick.  \n \nAlso, Anne K should know better to complain about their delivery service.  If  she was in such a hurry to get dinner, she should have picked it up herself.  I recommend that she do some research about how hard those delivery people work  (they were recently on strike at Saigon Grill.) \n\nOftentimes they are paid under the table bc many are here illegally.\nPlease excuse my digression", "author": "Andrew D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-25", "description": "Went to Chance last night with family.

I enjoyed the food overall, but there were some missteps along the way. Starting with the appetizers, we got spring rolls and crispy tofu with black bean asparagus sauce. The spring rolls were mediocre at best and have had much better elsewhere. The crispy tofu was very tasty and one of the highlights of our meal.\nWe both had the Curry entree--one chicken, one vegetable. The portion was large and very good, but compared to Song (a similar restaurant in Park Slope) it is overpriced with less flavor.\nAlso, the service was jumbled, and seemed unorganized.\nA good experience, but probably won't go back.", "author": "Dennis P."}], "servesCuisine": "Asian Fusion", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Chance Asian Bistro \u0026 Bar", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "223 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nVf4oOGcz96wVfNO9V1ZTg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17182421515"}
