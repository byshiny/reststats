The atmosphere is perfect. We had the raw clams, artichoke dip to start. For entrees, the Fisherman stew (delicious and a little spicy)  and the clam linguine (which i'm jealous my girlfriend had). Desert, the banana bread.\n\nIt was a great night all in all despite the pathetic loser next to us who was so rude to our waitress (Lauren was perfect the whole night).

From Brunch service to Dinner service it does it well. Friendly Bistro like interior. It is fun to sit at the bar as the bartender is friendly but table is for those who desire it also. I've been here for dinner and brunch and pushes out food that is comforting and good.\n\nWalter's makes a spicy kicking Bloody Mary. The chicken and waffles are on par. Crispy and nice and juicy fried chicken(although the last time one was slightly undercooked). The Walter's breakfast is always a pleaser and as far as bacon side goes it not as good as some others but better than many.", "author": "David N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-25", "description": "I went to Walter's for my birthday this past Wednesday and it could not have been a better experience.

Our waitress Natalie (Nathalie?) got every order in our group of 9 right- and the back-waiter brought everything out correctly to each person.

Sometimes it's hard getting a table but it's always worth it. Fried chick and steak are a must. Also the oysters are always amazing. I think the best oysters I have had in NYC.

Ambiance is casual, homey, yet clean and nice. Service is fast. Prices are fair, portions are good. Great for casual mornings with the family or friends, family friendly (although you may need to leave the stroller outside), and tasty all around. Prices are fair for Brooklyn.\n\nThe waits at Walter's can be quite long on a Saturday morning. But service is always efficient and friendly even though demand is crazy pants for them. The space is small and cozy, but they do have a couple of tables that can support larger parties of six or eight people. The booths are not super comfortable if you're carrying a lot of stuff, so try not to bring the stroller brigade. \n\nI've ordered: \nPomegranate lemonade - tasty and tart\nGinger beer - refreshing and spicy, served with lime for a squeeze of tart.\nShakshuka tomato stew - comfort food. Perfect winter breakfast melding rish egg yolks, a slightly acidic tomato stew, and lots of vegetables.\nChicken and waffles - the waffles are amazingly fluffy, with a fantastic maple butter. The chicken is super moist, tender, and has a fantastic crisp crust. \nWalter's Burger - classic great burger, cooked as well or rare as you like\nBlackened Catfish Sandwich - tasty, must if you like catfish\n\nIf you're willing to come early or wait a while outside, I'd definitely recommend.", "author": "Suanne L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-12", "description": "My favorite neighborhood spot! Cozy, always buzzing and no attitude.

Apparently oysters are their specialty. \n\nWe ordered a round of a dozen oysters - with all varieties to taste - and the pinot blanc wine - which was a nice pairing. We quickly realized that our favorite oysters were from the East Coast (From Virginia/Maryland area specifically). \n\nAfter that we ordered the Artichoke Dip - which was SO horrendous. That is why I cannot give Walter's a higher rating. Basically, the dish tastes like small artichoke bits (presumably de-frozen) surrounded with oily jack cheese that was microwaved. My spouse and I took one bite and looked at each other in shock. I think this is because we frequent Freeman's Restaurant in LES (in Freeman's Alley) and their artichoke dip is killer, unbelievable. So, we just could not believe the poor quality and ingredients that were used at Walter's. My spouse uttered, \"So they basically took artichoke, a bunch of jack cheese and put it in the microwave... We could have done this\". I concur with the assessment. \n\nConclusion: The oysters were good, but you can get the *same* East Coast oysters on Happy Hour at the Mermaid Inn for $1 each (!). So, next time I want oysters I will make the logical decision to eat at a locale where the oysters do not break the bank and the other menu items are also good, not Walter's.", "author": "Fazeela S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "Pretty much a mixed bag for me.  Pretty good food and drinks, despite the bartender being a little standoffish.  I had the watermelon and feta salad which was fresh and nice. The deviled eggs had a little bit of a strange synthetic aftertaste, but I think it was mixed with Sriracha to give them a little kick - maybe that did it?

I loved that they bring you mini banana chocolate chip muffins when you're are seated. The service is great, laid back and very friendly- there was a short wait and I appreciated that they recommended a nearby coffee shop instead of having us wait around at their own bar. The menu was small but varied, so there was still something for everyone... I wished my hash browns had been a little crispier and that the bagel of my breakfast sandwich had been a little toastier, but overall great experience in this sunny little breakfast spot and I would return in a heartbeat.", "author": "Helen L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-18", "description": "We've gone here for brunch many times, especially for the chicken and waffles.

We had VERY mediocre steak and eggs. Maybe it's just the brunch menu? Although Walters has a great and convenient location and the ambience is a perk. We just had to ask multiple times for basic items - so the table wasn't set properly (had to ask for salt and pepper, a steak knives to eat steak, etc.) then no one checked on the table and the servers weren't as warm as you would expect.

They give you a good amount of smoked salmon too. Fried chicken and waffles were good but I've had better at other places. The chicken was juicy but not that crispy. Ask for it to be extra crispy because I saw some tables with raw middles.
