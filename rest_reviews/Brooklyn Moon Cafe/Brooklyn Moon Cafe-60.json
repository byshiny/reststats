We have a table of 5. The service is awesome, but the food...not so much. The mac and cheese does not have any cheese. And the greens...well, they left much to be desired. And then, there was the roach that one of our party had to kill....DISAPPOINTING! And rather than comping ONE drink (that's all we asked for - only one free drink!), the management wanted to penalize the waiter, who was the positive part of the experience!

Prices are awesome only $14.95 and $1 extra for mimosa.The guava  flavor mimosa was spectacular, wished  it would  have been cold. Food wise I had fried  fish  and mac \u0026 cheese.

For starters I order the cat eggs , which I was not a fan of. Cat eggs consisted of turkey bacon wrapped in plantain. To much bacon not enough plantain , the plantains were not soft. My table entrees took a while to come , longest wait time I experience in a while. Despite the wait , my table enjoyed our meal. I ordered the fried chicken breast along with a side order of Mac n cheese and rice n peas. Grabbing the attention of my waiter was quit the task. I wouldn't mind revisiting Brooklyn Moon Cafe , however the service is poor, staff needs better time management skills. I requested the check for the table, and it took the waiter over 20 minutes to bring the check. I was expected better !", "author": "Maggie A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-13", "description": "Very nice location very clean and a great staff.

It is small, it is BROWN and it is delicious.\n\nIn a world of Brooklyn gone mad and an over abundance of \" coffee shops and hip bars\" it is nice to be in a place that reminds you of all the culture and flavor the Brooklyn offers.\n\nTo be absolutely frank my appeal to this place was a combinations of all the brown faces seated and the live jazz playing in the background.\n\nThe place is small but the atmosphere is comforting and the service is good. \n\nBecause it is a smaller establishment the wait time for food is LONG but I will say there was no issues once we received our food.\n\nKeep doing your thing Brooklyn Moon !", "author": "Wanda W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-26", "description": "Zero stars. Sigh, this place and most of their incompetent employees. The long Saturday afternoon my family visited (believe me, had they not teased us with food \"coming in just a moment\" we wouldn't have been there for two damn hours waiting to eat) the lady servers working were professional, but the cooks, the male waiter and busboy that came to our table had to have been on another freaking planet. \"Good service\" isn't being a chucklehead that jokes about why your appetizers hasn't been coming the last hour and a half, or pretending to give a damn when asking about a watered down drink you took an hour to bring, and then taking a half hour to bring an alcoholic beverage that you don't even have to make. Waste of time, waste of money, and even though I wasn't paying I was still pissed off for my late-lunch-turned-tapas companions.

Ordered the whiting, cheese grits, salad and a side of fries. Everything was flavorful. 1 dollar flavored mimosas, cant beat that. There was a dj that played R\u0026B. The bartender name was Mike.

My first experience here was really good. The mimosas were amazing and cheap, and the bartender was really nice and sociable. It was amazing seeing all the pretty girls with nnatural hair as the staff too. However, it\u200b seems like each following time I've\u200b come here the service just went down a little. This past time of coming here on Columbus Day weekend\u200b\u200bd, the service was just awful. We didnt have to wait for a seat which was amazing since we were there during peak brunch time, but our food took almost an hour to get to us and they forgot a couple items we had ordered AND our server got an attitude when we asked about the missing items as if we were bothering her for asking for the food WE ORDERED. And it wasn't\u200b just us but the lady next to us who was there by herself was waiting for crazy long too. I'd be a little more understanding if the place was super packed and\u200b we ordered a lot of\u200b food\u200b but I\u200b just simply don't\u200b understand how it could have taken so long. Also, they didn't\u200b have their regular menu out (which sucked) but rather a printed brunch menu that I'm assuming they only use during certain times of the day. My issue with this, other than it making our options ridiculously limiting,  is if there were so few items to choose from and everyone would have to get damn near the same thing, why would the food take that long?", "author": "Jazmyne D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-05", "description": "I kind of love this spot. The vibe and the atmosphere is always dope.  The drinks are super strong and the food is delicious.\n\nI've been continuously working my way through the menu.  The curry mussels are a must-have. First of all, they're huge!  I really wonder where they are finding mussels of that size from.  They come in a simple appetizer plate on a bed of greens which soak up the seasoning nicely or as a dish with an additional 4 (i think) and your choice of side. I'm partial to the macaroni and cheese.  The jerk chicken is very tasty but you can get equally as tasty jerk dinners from your local Brooklyn carry out for less.  It's good but it's not necessary to the average Brooklynite who may already have their preferred jerk spot in their respective neighborhood.  The crab cakes a delicious but they only come in 3s and you may not want to share.  The spicy shrimp is a standout appetizer that you actually can share.  It's perfect!  I tried the whiting off of my friend's plate.  It was cool to me but I don't really eat too many fish dishes so I don't have much of an opinion. She loved it though *shrugs*.\n\nNow to the drinks...they're the added selling point that would bring me  in here multiple times in the same week.  They're not the cheapest outside of Happy Hour which I always seem to miss (they've got great deals everyday) but they also aren't absurdly priced.  On top of that they're all very strong so it's worth it. I recommend the Seawater.  The Mango is also a nice.  \n\nI notice a number of reviews criticizing the service but I have yet to have had an issue.", "author": "Keilon L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-11-18", "description": "Very tiny inside, disorganized waiting system and terrible service! My friend from grad school recommended coming here for Sunday brunch last week after she had been to the restaurant about a year ago and we were both terribly disappointed. First off, there's no waiting area and the bartender with the dreads and the undercut is the rudest human being on the planet. Interacting with him and the confused hostess made me and my party reasonably decide to take our business elsewhere. It's sad to write a bad review for this place because I believe this place is black owned but there are wayyy better places to go in Brooklyn. I guess this place started off great and then went completely downhill.
