Their array of raw ingredients is extensive and I have yet to be disappointed with any of the juices from the menu. I usually get the 'Get Smart', which is a mix of beets, carrots, spinach, and orange - cold, sweet, delicious, and the perfect way to start my day. The beverage menu also includes smoothies and wheatgrass shots ($2 each), and I love that they have a wide array of mix-ins (protein powders, chia seeds, bee pollen, etc.) that can be included in your drink at a nominal cost. For those that want a more conventional (read: solid) breakfast, they serve egg sandwiches, wraps, tossed salads, and toasts. I, for instance, have my eye on the $5 avocado toast for my next morning visit. \n\nWhile waiting for my juice to be prepared today, I was perusing the hot sandwich menu and was delighted to find that they have a vegetarian option. At $7, this 'Tofusion' sandwich seemed to have a slightly steep sticker price but I swung for it anyway upon my return at lunchtime and I am so, so glad I did. Nearly 10\" long (if not a full foot), this is a behemoth of a sandwich in both size and stuffing. A medley of hummus, tofu, zesty pesto, cucumbers, tomatoes, and a surprisingly generous helping of avocado are layered onto a neatly toasted and sliced ciabatta roll (vegans may want to eschew the pesto layer, which probably has cheese). Packed with protein and fresh veggies, this was a light yet completely satisfying meal and well worth the price, especially considering a sandwich half this size at the nearby health foods store is the same price. If I had any complaint, it's that the tofu was relatively plain and undressed, but its blandness is a negligible point, especially since it's paired with more flavorful buddies. \n\nThings can get a little chaotic in here, especially during the lunch hour when the guys behind the pizza counter are shouting \"Next! Who's next?!\" over the din of customer traffic. Dining in is NOT recommended since there's really only four or five seats along a wall counter. However, service is extremely efficient - no one waits around long for their food - and the guys behind the juice/sandwich/salad counter are always congenial. They remembered my usual order after just two consecutive visits and treated me like a regular, chatting amicably with me as I waited for my drink. For the friendliness, food, fresh juices, and incredible value, this little pizzeria has definitely earned its keep in my list of lunch spots.", "author": "Jane I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-04", "description": "Great place for breakfast and lunch!\nI get my breakfast here every morning, if you want a healthy quick breakfast this is the place to go and the price is very reasonable.

Meh, unless it's \"premium\" pizza with fresh mozzarella, it's a pass. Then came upon this new place. It was one guy in a small storefront about 200 feet square. Pino is his name, from Sicily. There were 6 slices left, none the plain kind. They all looked a bit dry. But I was hungry and the man seemed nice. \n\nI got a spinach and ricotta, no red sauce. Oh yum. And not because I was hungry. In spite of the dry look, the spinach was plentiful and flavorful. The ricotta was not overly salty and in just the right amount to give the slice that fresh ricotta texture And the crust? Some pizzas are defined by their toppings. This pizza is all about the crust. The bottom was perfectly crispy without the top being burned. You could hold the slice without losing any of the toppings. It was barely foldable and actually cracked when you tried to fold it. You can taste the wheat, which was caramelized by the crustiness of the bottom. But it wasn't like a whole wheat that overtakes the rest of the slice. The flavors were well-balanced. \n\nAlso had some garlic knots which were moist with olive oil but not dripping, and full of fresh garlic. Might be the best garlic knots in the city.\n\nThere is a juice bar, but it was closed at 9:30pm. So it was just Pino and a few nutty customers including moi in the little storefront with one counter to eat at and a handful of stools.\n\nIt was worth stopping in. I dare say better than Grimaldi's.", "author": "Kiai K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-08", "description": "Awesome place, great for lunch, dinner, or whenever!

A space that's only slightly larger than a nearby studio apartment is filled with dozens of people. Some line up for salad or juices, though most are with me waiting for pizza. \n\nAntonio's has an efficient but basic system. Orders are taken down the line, you pay and then the order comes out of the oven. It's a grab and go slice joint, where ordering, heating, paying and eating take about 10 minutes at most. \n\nAnd the pizza is pretty fine. I'd stick to a plain slice as the throw on pepperoni slices on my pie were nothing special. The crust is nice and thin, the sauce not too sweet, this is solid B+ pizza. If this was downstairs from my office, I'd go a couple times a week.

They have quite a selection of items from heros and pasta to pizza and salads. I wasn't really in the mood for pizza so I ordered the eggplant parmesan hero.\n\nIt was definitely a hero! Huge and it was quite tasty with a good crusty bread and nicely seasoned and breaded eggplant. For only $6 you can't go wrong with this option. They also put it in a nice cardboard box so it won't be all crushed by the time you bring it back to the office. It does take a lot longer to prepare, so if you are in a rush, I would go for the pizza or salad instead.\n\nI would definitely come back to try other options on the menu. It's a pretty small and congested place so on a nice day take it to go and eat in the plaza outside of the courts.
