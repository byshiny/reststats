The crust is always thin and crispy like any toasted bread product should be. A little on the pricy side for pizza though. We had 4 beers, prosciutto pizza and a salad all which came out to about 65 bucks.\n\nFood: Excellent (but pricy)\nAtmosphere: Good\nService: Excellent", "author": "Dane M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-17", "description": "Awesome pizza. Probably one of the best pizza's i have ever eaten. There is nothing overly special about the place but the service is great, food is amazing. Highly recomend anybody to check it out at least once. I go with my girlfriend or friends here anytime we want pizza or just want to have a relaxing day. The pier is right outside and its beautiful. The windows give you a nice view of the brooklyn bridge and a bit of the city landscape. Really great place to just eat pizza and enjoy your party's company.", "author": "Gerardo T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-27", "description": "Really enjoyed the pizza here.

When we ordered the waitress tells us that they were out of green peppers which sucks because I like to order pizza with pepperoni and green peppers. How does a restaurant run out of green peppers maybe different Peppers but green come on.\nThe view is amazing you get to see the city you're right under the Brooklyn Bridge and you get to see little bit of the water so once again the view is amazing and the restaurant is right at the corner so you have a great view from where ever you sit.\nI do feel though that the amount of money we spent for two large pizzas was not worth it 1 I didn't get my green pepper on my pizza and 2 the crust was ok could have been baked a little longer.

And to think there are 2 world class pizza establishments less than 5 minutes walk away. Plus one WITHOUT an hour wait (at peak times) a different (towards Dumbo) 5 minutes walk.\n\nService is just so bad you think the owner/operator must be in Colombia and this is just a way to launder some money.\n\nPizza is mediocre at best, ... but I only regret having read reviews like mine AFTER we threw away the better part of $60.\n\nYes, as they (several others, for sure, re this one) say, 1 star is only there because Yelp isn't perfect either - a zero star option is needed and with \"Iggie's\" the only accurate rating.", "author": "Ed T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "Really amazing sauce. I could eat spoonfuls of it by itself. But the pizza(called \"The Pizza\") needed a bit of salt. I've heard there is better in Brooklyn but it's pretty dang good. The Pistachio Gelato was great too.

First off, I really enjoyed the food at Ignazio's. Second, the waiters were fantastic (specifically Tosh) and were always ready to help if we needed anything. Third, the amount of food served was enough to serve four people at least three times.\n\nThe cicillian opus pepperoni pizza pie that we ordered was very well balanced with the ingredients and the basil leaves that they topped it with expanded its flavor enough to the point where it was different, but still very enjoyable.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very nicely put together and if you sit in the right spot, you get a great view of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridge (as well as much of Manhattan itself).\n\nAgain, the service was great and I really enjoyed the food.\n\nIf you ask me, I think I may be heading back to Ignazio's for some more soon.", "author": "Lucy C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-16", "description": "This place is the worst pizza place I've been to in NY! The food takes FOREVER to come and when it does it's mediocre at best. The heavyset man who was there the one time I went was incredibly rude!!! It took the waiter 20 mins to bring my friend a cup of coffee. When I asked about it he tells me sometimes it takes 20 mins to get the machine working then proceeded to argue with me. So much for customer service and caring that they people who you are serving are happy. Trust me as a life long New Yorker this behavior is unacceptable.

The sun is hovering inches over the horizon at the end of a brutalizing hot summer day.  And then.  You step into the double doors of Ignazio's and a refreshing blast of cool air embraces you.  Gotta love that industrial air conditioner.  ;)\n\nGreat place with a fantastic view.  Price tag is decent (i.e. $34 for a medium pie w/ basil, red cherry tomatoes \u0026 bbq chicken ...slices, not chunks ...and only cause they were out of prosciutto) BUT when you factor in the view of Brooklyn Bridge, the almost unobstructed view of downtown Manhattan and the cute date sitting across from you who is smiling and isn't cross cause we didn't wait 1/5 hours to be crammed into Grimaldi's... perfecto.  That is, seating is easy if it's 2 people.\n\nBut yeah, cash only.", "author": "Jay M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "Went here for lunch with my mother after visiting a school in the fall. Cute little pizzaria. We split a pie and an order of Estelle's meatballs with mozzarella as an appetizer. Meatballs were very delicious and was such a big serving we ended up taking 1 home.

It actually reminds me of a family-chain ex: Califronia Pizza Kitchen, BJ's, Yardhouse..those type of place.\n\nThis imply, portion are extremely generous and expect kids running around everywhere.\nThe pizza isn't Brick Oven, but at least they don't cheap out on toppings.\n\nIf you're craving pizza for a good value this is a good choice.

I have eaten more then a few slices here - the baccon and avacado pizza?  Yes please!   \n\nNo bones about it - It's touristy, and slightly overpriced.

People working here have an ATTITUDE.\n\nWe are in 2015 and credit cards are going to be a thing of the past soon with Apple Pay and the like. And here we are with \"cash only\" places still.\n\nWe eat our bland pizza (too much cheese) and they say cash only but we have an ATM. \nI go to the ATM thinking ok, 3 or 4 dollar fee, not good but whatever. Of course the ATM didnt work. I asked them and nobody knew anything or could help me. It seemed they felt embarrassed about it. One waiter told me that it breaks all the time. Other people working here seem to be family members who don't take the job seriously.\n\nThey told me to go to another restaurant around the corner. I go there and it's broken too. I get my phone and search for ATMs. There is one by the ice cream store. I finally get my money after 15 minutes. Go back, pay and when i ask for the change they COMPLAIN!!! They said they want the tip. I was so angry. After making me walk for 15 minutes looking for an ATM they DEMAND a tip? RIDICULOUS.\n\nThe place looks outated and doesn't fit at all in the area.
