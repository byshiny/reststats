The chicken zorbian, lamb fahsah, hummus, and baba ghanoush are among my favorites. The bread, my goodness. It's a flathead about a foot and a half across, and when piping hot, soft and fluffy. I could live on that alone. If I have one gripe, and perhaps it's my own ineptitude, it's that when I've gotten takeout, the bread becomes incredibly hard soon after cooling down. Still working on tweaking my technique for reheating it. \n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and hospitable.

Enormous portions of excellent food, friendly service, and all at a great price, especially considering the neighborhood. \n\nWhen my friend and I came in, the waiter immediately brought out a dip, lemon slices, soup, and bread (and this was before we ordered anything). After we ordered we got a small salad. Tea is unlimited and complimentary, though you're expected to serve yourself from the samovar in the back. \n\nWe ordered the salta with lamb haneeth, which was way more food than the two of us could consume in one sitting. It was a bubbling stone pot of the stew plus a huge side portion of their slow-cooked lamb. I preferred the lamb to the stew (not a fan of okra), so I might get just the lamb next time. Some of the dishes on the appetizer menu also look great.

Fresh food, delicious fresh water served ice cold in chilled silver glasses (great on a hot summer day) . . . authentic Middle Eastern cuisine! When you walk in you are met with the smell of delicious spices, freshly baked clay oven bread, and a special kind of homemade tea that is unique to Yemen. The servers are warm and welcoming, and the restaurant is thoughtfully decorated. The hummus, baba ghanoush, complimentary soup, fatah with honey, and chicken agda (loubia) are incredible!!", "author": "Nicole M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-15", "description": "As a family we generally are not lamb eating people and like to stick with run of the mill  beef, chicken and fish diets; So, primarily it was good reviews that compelled us to give this place a shot and we were not disappointed: We ordered Lamb Haneeth, Lamb Fahsah and Humus. Haneeth came with the rice and it was totally delicious. We had lamb Fahsah with the oven cooked fresh bread and really loved it. \n\nNow the bread, soup and salad come free with the order. For desert, we had Fatah with honey and it wasn't bad either though I don't think I'd pay $10 anywhere else. The Yummy-Yemini tea came free and you are allowed to have as much as you want.\n\nI'd say the environment was casual demonstrating authentic Yemini culture but the service was polite and professional.

Service was fine. But man. I split the lamb haneeth for dinner, already knowing it was that much more expensive for dinner (22$ versus 16$ at lunch). Based on photos here and what I've heard, the entrees are large enough to split. However we got the most measly piece of lamb. Barely a serving and half of it was fat. The vegetable over the rice was the smaller DOLLOP ever. Like as if someone had accidentally spilled some on, not like it was meant for the dish. So essentially we were left with a huge amount of rice and barely any meat or sauce. I will say the lamb so super tender but how disappointing. I don't know if it's because we weren't Yemenite(although being North African, all the food and flavors are familiar to me) but that's what made it that much more disappointing. I know there's supposed to be more sauce and even more lamb. The soup that came with it was very familiar tasting, but also really salty. Bread was great. On the fence about if I'll return. I can eat the same food at home so", "author": "Sacha-Avi S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "I lived in the Middle East for years and had Yemeni food 2-3 times a week.  After trying many other Yemeni restaurants in NYC and the US, Yemen Cafe isn't really that spectacular.  I think it's the most friendly for people who don't know about Yemeni food or don't speak Arabic.  The other Yemeni restaurants in the area have the same or even better food and are much cheaper.  Yemen Cafe is way overpriced and the last few times I went the service was terrible.\n\nYemen Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz/yemenrestaurant-brooklyn-2) in Bay Ridge has waaaay better food (including dessert), it's half the price, and the staff are super kind (and speak perfect English).  Be careful not to accidentally end up at the other Yemen Cafe also in Bay Ridge though!

A large amount of food for the price.  Haneeth is slow roasted lamb served with a side of wonderful lot seasoned basmati rice covered with a great vegetable sauce.  It was all so good.  The lamb was extremely tender and tasty, and the rice was cooked perfectly.\n\nService was friendly as well.\n\nI can wait to come back and try some of their other dishes.
