Hot and juicy, satisfying size, just the way I like it. I got the mushroom and Swiss cheese burger, with the sweet potato Smashfries. Those things were AMAZING. Crispy and well seasoned, they were the perfect pairing for my burger. For about $12, this was a satisfying meal, and I hope to see more Smashburger locations around NYC.", "author": "Sanskar W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-18", "description": "Sounds like a great burger.

A franchise dishing out great burgers and fries at a great price.\n\nSmashburger is conveniently located on Dekalb Ave, with the restaurant steps away from Junior's, Fort Greene Park (to walk it off), and Brooklyn Hospital (if you don't walk it off).  The place is across the street from LIU's Health Sciences Building, so I always see stressed out PT Students chowing down for the 30 minutes they sacrificed from intense studying (remember this all too well).  I have already gone 3 times and will continue to return for those Smashfries!  Perfectly covered in olive oil, rosemary, and sea salt, Smashfries are perfection (although the fries from Smashburger on Route 17 in Paramus are bland in comparison).  I usually make my own burger with grilled onions and chipotle sauce or BBQ sauce on a whole wheat bun and I am never disappointed.  Would like to see more locations throughout 5 Boros!", "author": "Annie A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-22", "description": "Smashburger makes a decent burger and fries, but with five guys around the corner i don't see a reason to eat at this location.  the fries here are nothing special, which is the main reason i like five guys better, and the fried pickles were pretty bad compared to others i've had in the city.  i did a build your own burger with american cheese, ketchup, spicy mayo, lettuce, grilled onions, and tomato.  i really liked the spicy mayo and the lettuce and tomato were very fresh, but the burger meat itselt was kinda bland and wasn't that juicy.  If i was near a different location and five guys wasn't around the corner i'd give it another shot.", "author": "John P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-04", "description": "On Friday we stopped at Smash Burger in Forte Greene. It was a SMASH! Unbeknownst to me, it was their anniversary...and I learned that Mayor Bloomberg was the first NYC resident to eat a burger there. \n\nI decided to try the SMASH Fries...they were absolutely delicious. Not your average fries. They were\ntossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic. To top it off, they serve white wine...and I ordered a glass with my fries.\n\nWhile I was there, I also had a chance to chat with the staff. I had the pleasure of meeting Rose, a current LIU student studying English and chemistry. \"I absolutely love the atmosphere here, says Rose. I will miss it when I graduate this year.\"\n\nSo if you are in Forte Green, Downtown Brooklyn, Clinton Hill area, please stop over and visit SMASH Burger.  \n\n Don't forget to say hello to the proud owner: Mr. Jim Denburg.\n\nLet them know that you heard from Apples \u0026 Oranges Public Relations.", "author": "Apples Oranges P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-14", "description": "I want to make love to their burgers. \n\nHere's why: A juicy burger with guacamole, cheese, seasoned mayo, onions and tomato on a delicious bun with bits of goodness baked in.

Add a Dr.Pepper and smash fries and you have the best happy meal ever.  Maybe switch it up with a vanilla shake occasionally.  You order at the counter and then they bring the food to your table.

We ordered 2 classic burgers and smashfries to share. The burger was pretty good, nice and juicy and all the flavors melded nicely together. I'm getting hungry as I type about it.  The fries were shoestrings and the idea of the rosemary, olive oil and garlic was good, but they weren't tossed consistently so some fries didn't have the flavor.

All were spot on. My one complaint is that the jalapenos on the spicy baja sandwich are raw (I like mine pickled). \n\nThe manager is literally one of the nicest guys in downtown Brooklyn. Staff is friendly too. They bring out your food and even bring you a glass of water if you're super lucky. They have tables and chairs outside so I imagine it's a nice option to eat under the sun.\n\nAlso, it's super convenient to get to.

It's so amazing that I used a curse word in my reviews which I never do. Just writing this review makes me drool over the thought of it. The sweet potato fries were sinfully delicious.
