Overall we had a solid time.  Place was about half full when we came in...it was only about 630.  Started with cocktails.  I had a Gin Genever or something like that.  It was very tasty and well-made, and I believe $12.  Pretty typical for these new fancy Brooklyn restaurants.  For dinner I had the half chicken.  Yes it was a little on the salty side, but I really enjoyed it.  It was about the most moist chicken I've ever had at a restaurant, and the sauce and vegetables complemented it nicely.  My friend ordered the pork chop special which was really like pork chop 3 ways.  His plate was substantially larger than mine, so might be a good choice if you have a monster appetite!\n\nOur waitress was adorable and friendly.  She offered us recommendations for cocktails and food and was attentive.  I did like the design and atmosphere of the place.\n\nI'd probably give the place 3.5 stars, but I rounded down because exiting the restaurant proved to be slightly treacherous.  The door is right in front of the subway entrance and there were a couple steps that seemed hard to navigate.  Or maybe I'm just extremely uncoordinated.  Overall, I might return here if someone else suggested it, but with so many other similar places in the area, I'd probably choose to try others before returning here.", "author": "Jeff R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-23", "description": "Lovely interior. Great with a group. Service a little neglectful and sloppy but my entree was truly spectacular.

We also split a bottle of wine.\n\nThe good:\nThe flavors of the dish were well matched and harmonious.  \n\nThe bad:\nMy pierogies were undercooked and barely room temperature.  The rabe was too salty (and I love salt).  The steak was amazingly prepared and a great cut -- but 1/4 of the portion we get at our favorite TriBeCa steak place (Landmarc) for essentially the same price.  Since when did eating in TriBeCa become a good value??!\n\nThe ugly:\nThe service was terrible.  The waiter was pushy (he as been pushy with my fiancee in the past).  As soon as we finished our meal (which was not a lot to eat!), we had more than 1/2 the bottle of wine left.  The waiter and all the staff circled us like vultures (checking in on us every minute or 2, picking up our bottle of wine to see if we'd finished it, etc.) and made us feel totally unwelcome and rushed.  I've actually never experienced such aggressive and obvious 'turnover tactics.'\n\nI will never, ever step foot in that place again.  If I'm going to spend money on a meal and wine, I want to at least feel like I can have a conversation, enjoy myself, and finish what I've purchased.  \n\nOh -- and I was still so hungry afterwards that I had to get a slice down the block.", "author": "J.

Unfortunately, Recession Specials are all the rage these days. But if you feel like treating yourself one night, head to No. 7.\n\nGranted, I've only been here once. But once is enough to know that I want to return, and enough to write a Yelp review recommending you go there, pronto!\n\nMy group splurged and we each ordered an appetizer, an entree, and split a couple of desserts. For an appetizer, I got the tuna with korean pear and basil. It was perfect! Just enough tuna served up in bite-sized pieces that teased your stomach just the way you want it to.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the hangar steak. It. Was. Heaven. I can't even describe how tender the meat was. It was packed with taste, and it may have been the slowest I've ever eaten anything because I refused to ever be done with it. But best of all are the kimchi pierogies it comes with--a little bit of spicy, a WHOLE lot of deliciousness. The butternut squash side was really good too. All the components worked so well together.\n\nOf course we weren't going to turn down dessert. We shared the butterscotch pudding and another chocolate desert that I can't remember.

Instead, Kord has written a menu that, while terse, borrows from the ethnic diversity of the outer boroughs--kimchee pirogis, Asian pears and Israeli couscous--but still travels to Manhattan for staples that well-traveled diners expect--hangar steak, pork chops, seared tuna.  \n\nNews of No. 7 has been uproarious, given the Brooklyn address (and in Fort Greene, rather than Williamsburg or Park Slope) and well deserved, if not without certain shortcomings.\n\nThe space is well conceived: low, comfortable couches and armchairs sit in a window-paneled nook and look out onto the bar where a number of American beers can be had at reasonable prices.  A patina of age and distress that registers as one wanders over to the hostess stand behind which are three beautifully designed banquets that easily seat five in loquacious horseshoes just across from the pass where the bar adjoins to the open kitchen.  An ivory dining room nestles two-tops around the remainder of the restaurant's perimeter and a larger table still maintains its autonomy.  \n\nThe open kitchen is a sterling touch as it lies in the margin where diners may or may not want to put their attention.  From there, Kord and two other cooks perform a type of East meets West fusion that has moments of great success but also produces certain muddles that would escape even E.M. Forester.\n\nOur meal began with delicious crusty bread served with a buttery butter bean puree and quick-pickled cucumbers, which served to whet our appetite.  An appetizer of tempura broccoli and black bean hummus offered entire stalks of the verdant vegetable, but the black hummus was superfluous as it could not withstand the size, heft or texture of its pairing; furthermore, the florets had been packed with some cheese or curd whose texture mirrored the smear of tahini and black beans. \n\nTwo salads came with the same pile of beautiful baby greens dressed in citrus vinaigrette that was crisp, clean and wholly appropriate.  An \"everything focaccia\" with a goat cheese spread was poorly conceived and should have been argued against.  Previously, the dish was plated with a brioche crouton, but the focaccia (a sad take on the everything bagel) cheapened the dish and made it seem like a lunch special in midtown. In comparison, that same salad served with thin sliced pork, whose color and flavor echoed the red pork that hangs in Chinatown windows, and a panko-crusted and fried soft-boiled egg was a highlight of the meal.  This egg, ingenious and unctuous, gave the salad and the pork counterpoints in mouthfeel and fun.\n\nThe hangar steak was as tender and rich as that treacherous (but cost effective) cut can be.  It was artfully plated on a bed of butternut squash puree crossed by deep green broccoli rabe and three kimchee pirogis.  The much-anticipated pirogis disappointed: they had none of the succulence of ravioli, little of the street-fare glee of Korean mandoo, and none of earthy fire of kimchee.  The conceit of this entr\u00e9e is on target; only the execution of those pesky pies need be tinkered with.\n\nA plate of grouper on Israeli couscous was ho-hum.  The fish itself was lightly seasoned and overall it worked as a healthy (female-friendly) choice but seemed out of place on a menu that was so much more creative.\n\nAs our meal entered its endgame and the busses and trains that criss-cross Brooklyn awaited, our server (who seemed eager to please but something of a food novice) encouraged us to have dessert.  The banana pudding and the apple tart succeeded in that they did not overwhelm.  The banana pudding arrived in a glass bowl and cuddled a core of crunchy, savory and salty nuts or crackers (our attempt to find out the filling went unrequited).  The apple tart came with a smear of ch\u00e8vre foam (a tad pass\u00e9, true) but the flavors were tight and bright.  The \"crust\" was a walnut shortbread that slid too easily across the plate, so an anchor might enhance the diner's overall experience.  Nevertheless, the desserts did not exert too much force on the meal.\n\nThe check was remarkably low at the end of the evening.  No. 7 is just a couple stops from home and, then, a few feet from the subway exit.  As an aside, the bust stop is only a couple storefronts down.", "author": "Kevin K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-24", "description": "Did you ever get the feeling that the chef has had everyone he knows write a glowing review of his new joint, and a whole bunch of other people have decided to write overwhelmingly negative reviews to balance the flow?

I'd struggle to make a case half as passionate as any of the previous reviewers - positive or negative.\n\nYes - the space is really cool, and whoever designed it did an excellent job, but is that why you go to a restaurant?  And yes, the wait staff and bartenders are rude at worst, or abrupt at best, but this is New York.

No. 7 clearly wants to be the clever, avante garde kid on the block - the poster child of New Brooklyn.  It just winds up being really confusing.  Grits with shrimp?  huh?  You're probably not going to find dishes as creative/inventive anywhere else, but all the unnecesary complexity leaves the food overseasoned, oversalted, and often times overcooked.", "author": "Rob W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-16", "description": "The second time was even better...\n\nI think that i have now at least tried the majority of the offerings on the menu and am even happier with the food the second time.\n\nFirst however lets have a drink...the bar (while nice in atmosphere) was not terribly friendly and the bartender really seemed like she was annoyed to have to deal with me...i did like the extra little mini-pitcher of martini to supplement the small martini-glass size...\n\nThe food..\nthey seemed to have thinned the white bean puree white a bit and it's a good thing, it's still nice but it is a little less filling now.\n\nThe CHICKEN (!!) is really very nice.  Yes i know that the chicken is often the chef's least favorite offering (added for finicky and tasteless old ladies) - this is not the case here.  It's actually an amazing dish with a boneless breast rolled and crispy-fried in the skin with carrot(?) puree boc-choy and a truffle jus - really a winner - hearty and tasty(!!) but not heavy\n\nI had the Tuna Entree which perfectly-cooked tuna steak served with fava beans and chopped collard greens.  This was really tasty but had been over-salted considerably - otherwise it would have been really amazing.\n\nThe Pork appetizer was really great. it was two hearty slices of cured/smoked/aged (damn-it i need a menu) pork with a small side salad and apple slices (?) was really an amazing flavor combination.  Perfectly balanced salty/smoky/sweet/sour flavors in each bite...just really a nice little starter.\n\nThe only real vegetarian dish (shame - i do get it, forget them, but this is Brooklyn) was ok.  It seemed to be house made noodles (or filo dough even) layered with veggies and topped with (very) stinky cheese.

It's a gamble to invite a bunch of people out to dinner at a restaurant you have never visited, but this time it paid off:\n\n1. The restaurant itself is classy and intimate but still easily accommodated our party of eleven.\n\n2. The specialty cocktails (which bear seemingly random numbers instead of names) were unique and proved to be delicious.  Mine was composed of porter apple, tequila, and black tea liqueur, and it was amazing.\n\n3. The appetizers are absolutely insane.  In skimming Yelp reviews, I had seen the fried broccoli appetizer mentioned with some frequency, so we tried that.  We expected it to be broccoli florets that were lightly fried, but no: it was an entire stalk of broccoli, breaded and deep-fried, with some sort of cheesy sauce oozing out from somewhere.  It was decadence at its best.  We also tried the cold octopus, and we were pleasantly surprised to find the octopus was really tender, not chewy like octopus can be.\n\n4. The entrees, while limited in option, were great.  I had the artic char with celery root puree and brussels sprouts.  My only quibble was that the brussels sprouts were really, really buttery - but that didn't stop me from eating every last one.  The boyfriend had the steak which came with a surprising (but delicious) fried pear.\n\n5.

Fried tempura style with a hearty batter that oozes flavor all over your wet dirty mouth. its $7 and comes with dill. With this in my mouth, I thoroughly enjoyed masticating.\n\nThe hangar steak was also extremely well executed and came out nice and red and for $24 is a great deal.  It comes with kim chi pierogies, aptly named, because its a fusion of kim chi \u0026 pierogies.  Awesome.\n\nThe bread also comes with a nice potato based puree, tasty and free.\n\nPlace would get five stars for the steak and brocolli, but everything else is overpriced and ranges from decent to mediocre: this includes the Monkfish.\n\nAs for desserts, what's the fuckin point when CakeMan Raven is down the street. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that the chicks here are not hot, besides the ones I came here with.  Draw what conclusions you will. Converesely, the martinis come with a flask to hold the extra martini from the shaker, more martini for your money and that is Awesome.

I agree with Furyk - it's a gem! The restaurant is beautiful. The front bar is very old school, intense tile and a lounge area set against very, very, big beautiful windows. This week is their soft launch, so there are some unfinished details. The back room is getting plants apparently, which will be nice. Still, I ate in the back and really enjoyed the banquet and tables. A gorgeous wood floor, too. The bathrooms are great, big with white tile and wood again.\n\nI spoke with the restaurant manager/owner, Matt, who told me about the wines that will be coming in shortly and plans for coffee in the mornings and brunch will be served in the upcoming months. The garden won't be open till the spring, but he let me take a took and it's pretty big, lots of green.\n\nThe staff was incredibly nice. I did wait for a table, but it was only 15 mins., so my friends and I got a drink. \n\nI guess I should mention what I ate:\n\nI had the tuna app. and green salad. Both were delicious. The salad comes with this bread that is simply too yummy for words. We actually ordered a second round of that. Not sure what's in it - butter beans, butter, something else. \n\nI had the roast pork app. as well. My friend ordered it and I will definitely order it next time. The chef cooks it with a fried/poached egg! I recommend it. \n\nFor entrees, I had the hangar steak with kimchi pirogues. Never had that before and was delighted. Hangar steak really isn't my thing, but I wanted to try those darn pirogues! The broccoli and sauce it comes with are also stellar.\n\n I'm not sure what Jim is talking about. The dessert was one of the best parts! I had a banana pudding that my entire table couldn't get enough of. We ordered a second round of that as well. We were there late and the chef sent over a sandwich for us to try. I think it was pork shoulder? Not sure, but it also had cucumbers, spicy mayo, really simple. He was giving it to a few tables as it was under consideration for the bar menu. I really liked it. Surprisingly too, because I'm not so much of a sandwich gal. To Furyk's point - I think the chef is ironing out the kinks in the menu. Brooklyn ain't easy, but I really enjoy the process of making it all work. He's clearly top notch. I googled this place and it came up that he worked at Jean Georges, so you know... \n\nI think this is what Fort Greene is missing right now - a bigger sized restaurant that has a bar and really high level food. \n\nThe real thing about this place is that you want to linger. We were there until around 1:30 (!!!) just drinking. I recommend this place for groups of people especially. I also saw two people eating alone at the side tables that face the very open kitchen. Not sure about the date vibe though.\n\nOne of the bartenders is from Bonita, a staff member from the Farm  was there and it was nice to see some familiar faces.
