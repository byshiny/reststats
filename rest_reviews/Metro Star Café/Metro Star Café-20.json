I used to come here a lot when I was a student at city tech. What a suprise to see the same people working the food counter and the food tasted just as good as it did in 1999. The hot food up stairs is very good and the price is good for the amount of food you get. If your in the area I don't think you'll be disappointed.", "author": "Olena P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-06", "description": "Like Andy H., I discovered this place while fulfilling my civic duty at the courthouse in downtown Brooklyn.\n\nMetro Star has a pizzeria downstairs, but serves hot food, salads, and sandwiches upstairs, where you can actually sit down and eat your lunch. \n\nI wasn't sure what I wanted when I walked in, but I knew I wanted something kind of different, so when the guy behind the counter suggested this sandwich, I just said ok.  Baked chicken cutlet and fresh mozzarella with lettuce, tomato, and oil and balsamic vinegar on a toasted crispy Italian loaf.  Delicious and relatively cheap, considering the amount I've paid at Subway for three lousy slices of turkey to cover my 6\" sub.\n\nThis place made sitting for jury duty that much more tolerable.  Grazie!", "author": "Beatrix D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-08", "description": "Sopped here on the way to MetroTech from the subway, to get a breakfast.   Fast, plentiful, tasty and a price that couldn't be beat.   Not fancy.

Inexpensive lunch spots in downtown Brooklyn are difficult to find.  Not only does this place have really decent pizza, they have a two-slice-and-a-soda-deal for $4.50.  Cheapest tasty lunch I've found so far, amigos.  Those disgusting gyros from the street carts don't count.", "author": "Kyle H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-20", "description": "This is one of my go-to places for lunch while at work when I'm not in the mood for anything in particular.  The reason for this is that they have such a wide variety of food that I can usually just find something there and be very happy with it.\n\nMy top three meals there are:  the roasted turkey sandwich on whole wheat with lettuce and a cranberryish sauce, the thai chicken wrap, and the salmon over salad with noodles on the side.\n\nIt's pretty much on par price-wise with everything in the expensive Brooklyn Heights area, but at least it is all delicious.", "author": "Daniel C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-05", "description": "I use to frequent this place for the pizza, until today!  The lady came all the way close to the back of the line (lunchtime the line is out the door) and asked me my order.  I told her 2 plain.  She asked me if I wanted the soda with it I said no.  She took the five dollars out my hand.  When I got to the front of the line she said I gave her nothing and started speaking Spanish to her Co-Worker.  Lesson Learned!  Will never go there again.  If I would have went fool up in their I would have been the cray z one.  Should be Metro Rob Cafe cause I was robbed without a weapon.", "author": "D S."}], "servesCuisine": "Cafes", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Metro Star Caf\u00e9", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "369 Jay St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CvveR_PJ00_KeqfgR7u58Q/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188525894"}
