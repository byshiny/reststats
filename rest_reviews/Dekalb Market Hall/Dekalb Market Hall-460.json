So many awesome options. I take people here all the time, and I recommend it highly.\n\nMy favorite places for food: Arepa Lady, Bunsmith, Eight turn crepe, Likkle More, and Wilma Jean. Hana Noodles, too (though I don't eat there often because it's carb-heavy).\n\nClose seconds for food: Katz's Deli (pricey, but still great). Bread and Spread sandwiches. Fletcher's BBQ. \n\nFavorite places for desert: Ample Hills Ice Cream, Cuzin's Duzins donuts\n\nAlso, some of the specialty places are great. The NobleTree coffee place is awesome. The cheese shop is amazing.\n\nPlaces to skip: Paella shack (overpriced, not enough meat/food). Foragers (everything other than the chicken itself is poor quality). \n\nI haven't tried the sit-down places yet, but they look very good. I think it's an Italian/Pizza place and a spicy chinese food place, if I'm not mistaken.", "author": "Noah S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-30", "description": "Best place to get different types of tastes!  So many varieties and also a Trader Joe's near by if you need to do some food shopping!  Conveniently there's a Target right upstairs to do regular shopping as well.

It gives you great variety of foods. It definitely has a funky feel to it. It's almost like an upscale food court lol. However, you can get beer and wine here too and even walk around with It.

Lots to choose from but favorites are the BBQ Lamb tacos, Smoked Crab tacos, Ample Hills Ice Cream  and Katz's Deli. I wish the poke spot there would add salads.

Such a great variety of places to have lunch, dessert or even grab a beer.  Some of the stands are a little pricey and need some additional seating but all in all a great stop to make for a variety of options.", "author": "Meritza H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-11", "description": "There's a lot of variety for sure and the quality of the food is top tier without a doubt, but let's be honest, this is the expensive part of brooklyn. How are you going to charge $7 for just a cheeseburger?! Yes, yes, it's delicious as heck but it's no shake shack (YEAH I said it!)\n\nPrice aside, this is a culinary playground and I will continue to visit this money-sucking palate pleaser.", "author": "Lissa D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-05", "description": "Great food selections, limited seating.

I somehow always wind up getting ice cream from Ample Hills no matter what, it's just so good! And there's a shop there where you can get some really nice local brews, and even walk around drinking your drink while you peruse the other restaurants. There's something here for everyone, and it's a great place to go and eat after you've done all your shopping at the stores above. I bet it could even be a great date place if you're not sure what kind of food your date would be into.", "author": "Tamara H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-22", "description": "Food and service is awesome at all vendors. Location is great. Trader joe's is inside to shop for home as well.

There can be hit or miss depending on the stall or area you visit at the hall, but make no mistake, there are meals fit for KINGS. I dare say that the market hall's churros dipped in hot chocolate sauce are delicacies beyond mankinds imagination. I personally lost myself in the goodness of that chocolate. Additionally, there is a yummy spicy kebab with yogurt sauce(sounds unappetizing I know but I personally guarantee that it will send you to your next life). The Dekalb market hall doesnt only have stalls for informal meals. If you're looking for a great sitdown meal, I recommend going to Han Hynasty, a step up from the traditional Chinese takeout with elevated decor and REAL traditional Chinese dishes. A small note, the Dan noodles were so spicy I started tearing up in pain, you have been warned. A final note, the store named Katz Deli is a daylight robbery with its $25 price tag and quality inferior to deli sandwiches.", "author": "Jeeper K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-18", "description": "Linos subs amazing!\nHomefrits truffle fries flavor is too much.

Everything is kind of overpriced, the lines for some of the stalls are really long, and it's almost impossible to find a place to sit. All of the food is average, there's nothing that is truly amazing.
