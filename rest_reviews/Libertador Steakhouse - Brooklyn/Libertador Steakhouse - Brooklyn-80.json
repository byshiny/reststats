Libertador is a high end yet casual Argentinian restaurant with a meat-centric menu. The rustic yet classy atmosphere is beautiful and fits the neighborhood wonderfully. Prices are a bit higher than what you'd want to pay for a weekly casual dinner but is reasonable for what you're getting as most meals are $20-30. To start we tried a couple of their empanadas (2 for $8), we ordered beef and chicken but recieved beef and ham. The crusty dough was perfect but I wasn't thrilled with the fillings, especially as the beef had lots of peppers and even olives inside of it, something they should have described on the menu as my girlfriend loaths them. \n\nFor a meal we split the Parillada Para Dos (mixed grill for two for $45). This comes on a cast iron grill with short ribs, prime skirt steak, new york strip steak, chicken breast, chorizo, served with salad and your choice of homemade mashed potatoes or their \"famous\" french fries provenzal (of course we opted for the fries). I found most of the meat to be a bit greasy and not the most tender cuts of meat except for I believe it was the strip steak which was perfect. The salad came in a tiny bowl on the side which wasn't anything special. The fries definitely did live up to our expectations however, they were super crispy garlic fries that I would definitely get again. \n\nAlthough I wasn't blown away by everything I had here the atmosphere and service was wonderful and I would definitely consider coming back for the NY Strip and fries in the future.", "author": "Matt E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-13", "description": "This restaurant is excellent.  My wife and I ordered the mixed grilled for 2 and it was exquisite.  The service was also great.

Yet at the essence they deliver well prepared Stakes of your choice. All food is fresh. Staff is courteous. Great casual wine list with great prices per glass. I ordered a glass of red. It had turned. I politely brought it to their attention.  No questions asked. They came to my table with a sealed bottle fresh in hand. Gave me a pour to insure all was good, and it was. \n\nThe only problem, and this has nothing to do with the restaurant.  The neighborhood is changing, and you have your jerseys and transplants ruining the very casual relaxed vibe of this carefully executed decor, and menu.  Sunday through Thursday is a sure shot for a more low key great dining experience. Sorry if you are not a NYC native.  The majority of transplants and jerseys hanging in Brooklyn, can ruin the best dining experience. Whatever happened to restaurant etiquette regarding the way the customer should respect a fine dining establishment??????  I'm being honest yet picky. I'm getting tired of all you to cool for school transplants mucking everything up.  Yeah. Btw. At Least learn your cuisine before you critique it.", "author": "jay r."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-27", "description": "One of the better steak places.

It wasn't too busy on a Sunday night. The restaurant is dimly lit and it has high ceiling so it feels very spacious.\nThe food is definitely on point! We ordered sweetbread and yellowfin tuna carpacio as appetizers. It was my first time trying sweetbread, it was grilled perfectly, tender and moist! Got skirt steak and another steak dish for entrees. The skirt steak was cooked perfectly! Seriously to die for!

What does one do on a Saturday morning with a tablet?  Every other restaurant in the area has wifi - is the password really this important to the bottom line?  Just to be clear,  I was 1 of 2 people in the restaurant at the time. \n\n I had to leave to go to another restaurant that had wifi (fyi, every restaurant in the area has wifi or wifi access).  I adore the owners  but the decisions made  by staff are interesting at best.  \n\nHope things change!\n\nConcerned neighbor.", "author": "A B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-09", "description": "Had the 14oz skirt steak medium rare.

We chose this restaurant based on its reviews on Yelp to celebrate my mother's 67 birthday and we were NOT disappointed. Mom's request was that she wanted good steak and boy did she and all of us get that. \n\nFirst of all there were 18 of us and some in the party were running late because of traffic. And I mean late. \nThe hosts had our tables ready to go and seated us so we could wait for the rest of our group to arrive. \n\nSome places won't seat you unless the entire group is there AND within a certain time frame. Nope, our hosts were awesome. \n\nOnce the entire group made it in and the food was served everyone and I mean everyone was delighted with their dish. The meat was tender, juicy and just perfect. I don't eat much meat and ordered grilled chicken but I tried my daughter's and nephew's strip stark and porterhouse respectively and quickly regretted it. Don't get me wrong the grilled chicken dish was amazing but it's rare that I have such regrets about passing up a steak. I guess we will have to go back soon and make that up! ; ) \n\nAmazing atmosphere, food and people.

The way they cook the meat, the provoletta wasn't grill. Not a real Argentinian restaurant. They don't even serve the full menu on weekends, which is dumb.
