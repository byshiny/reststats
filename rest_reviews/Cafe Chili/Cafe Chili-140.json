Unfortunately, the food here is just mediocre.  The service and the decor help, but it eventually boils down to the quality of the food.  I might stop by if the others are packed but if there is an open table elsewhere, that's where I'll be for my thai.", "author": "Sang H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-18", "description": "I was very surprised after reading all the negative feedback that this restaurant has recieved.  My boyfriend and I go there almost every week and we are never dissapointed.  The atmosphere is very nice, the food is delicous and the service is always very good.", "author": "Melanie T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-10", "description": "Very, very disappointing. Nice interior. However, the food was well below par. My drunken seafood noodles were a mess of overcooked angel-hair pasta with rubbery seafood in soap-dishy-tasting broth. The fried tofu appetizer was the consistency and flavor of cardboard.
