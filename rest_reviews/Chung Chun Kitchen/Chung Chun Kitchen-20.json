I decided to order the orange chicken with vegetable fried rice. Chicken was good but rice sucked. Very little vegetable's. I also had an order of crab claws for an appetizer which was too much food but good price. 2 claws and I'm good. Orange chicken again not bad and not crispy but sauce was good.", "author": "William C."}], "servesCuisine": "Chinese", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Chung Chun Kitchen", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "338 Myrtle Ave", "postalCode": "11205", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BiQVxjC71uhb7KKQafkfdw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188552119"}
