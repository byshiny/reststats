Not hungry enough for a whole burrito/burrito bowl? It's not on the menu but ask for a quesadilla with your meat of choice and they'll whip it right up. Come in at the wrong time and the line can go on for days but it moves quickly. Sure they have their off days, under cooked rice once, too salty guac another time but definitely more home runs than strikes. They aren't stingy with the toppings either.

I'm in the nieghborhood pretty often because my school and gym are near, so chipotle (CH) has become one of my fav lunch spots. However, as many Chipotle devotees, may tell you, what may start out as an occasional hankering can quickly become an addiction lol. \n\n It is located near a couple of colleges and school, so in addition to the locals and nearby employees,  there is a fair amount of young people who dine here but they are pretty tame and I've never seen them cause a ruckus.  \nMy one gripe with this particular store is the people behind the counter. While on the whole, the employees due a satisfactory job, there are  certain employees, when I see them, I sigh because I know they will get my order wrong. It seems as if they are either in too much of a rush to fill your order or they're simply not listening carefully to customer requests. The assembly line prep of the food is quite efficient, IF the the ingredients you asked for are actually included! \n\nSpeaking of ingredients, IMO, everything from the onions/peppers to the guacamole are fresh and delicious. As someone from a carribean culture, rice is a staple in my diet and as such, I have high standards when it comes to it. I have to say that I am amazed if a fast food place can provide decent rice and Chipotle surely does deliver on that end!  The one exception to my love affair with Chipotle's food, however, are the carnitas. To me, they were pretty bland so that's a selection I won't be making again. \n\nI've been to a couple of other chipotles, but overall,  this particular one is my favorite . Its big (2 floors of seating), there are multiple bathrooms, and of course, the prices are cheaper in comparison to it's manhattan counterparts. Sure, a meal here may cost you more than traditional fast food places but you're paying for quality and the cost difference is about $2, so it's not as if you're going to be breaking the bank.  In a world full of prepackaged food and fried something or other, CH is a fresher, tastier and healthier alternative! \n\nBonus Tip: if you like the burritos but you feel as if they're too big/ too much food for you, order 2 soft shell tacos and ask them to fill them with whatever you'd normally put in your burrito..its like 2 mini open face burritos!", "author": "Cassandra B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-01", "description": "The food was great, but the service sucked.

I have to say this is by far the worst Chipotle I have been to.  The staff is somewhat rude and tries to push the line along despite the bottlenecks. (I.e., nowhere to go).  But worst of all - last time I ate the Chicken bowl it was disgusting.  The chicken taste like left over giblets, bone, fat from the wrong cut of meat.  Maybe that was a one off experience, but the portions are always lackluster as well. Luckily they opened a newer location by Metrotech so I started going to that one.", "author": "W J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-09-04", "description": "I love Chipotle and in general, I like this location.

It's about $2 less for my order than I pay in Manhattan.  A few years ago Chipotle jacked up the prices in NY, but skipped the outer boroughs, and I take full advantage when I'm nearby!\n\nDisclaimer: I'm a chipotle fanatic, and have probably been to most of their NYC locations, but for price and seating, this (along with the one on 18th \u0026 8th in Chelsea) is one of my favorites.\n\nThey have an upstairs area that is rarely full despite the huge crowds, and the long lunch lines move quickly.  They occasionally use a mobile POS (register) device to speed up the process.\n\nOnline ordering is available if you want to bypass the line, but whenever I see someone picking up their order at the register, the cashiers seem a bit inconvenienced and overwhelmed trying to handle the order while staying attentive to the huge moving line they're trying to ring up.", "author": "Daniel K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-24", "description": "I love chipotle but this location is pretty horrible. The staff and managers are rude and the food is inconsistent. The white rice is often overcooked or completely flavorless and the chicken isn't always cooked enough. They also refuse to correct mistakes. When a burrito rips or they put the wrong topping on they just expect you to take it and talk back if you say something. They also think they can get away with talking about customers or telling each other to give you the old ingredients so they can put new ones out by speaking in Spanish, but I can absolutely understand what they are saying and it's just rude. The line gets backed up, and one time I asked for guac without being able to see it. When I got up to the counter I saw that it was completely brown and asked them to make me a new bowl without guac but they refused, assuring me that the guac had just been put out. It didn't taste right so I pushed it to the side, but I got sick and was throwing up all night.", "author": "Jeri E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-23", "description": "I am a regular at this Chipotle and it is a chain.  \n\nConsistency is standard of any other Chipotle.

The girls that actually prepare your food are cool.  I talk to them in Spanish so it makes it easier to order and receive what it is that I want.\n\nThe clientele wise brings about an interesting mixture of hipsters, law enforcement, lawyers, and 20 some year olds.\n\nDecor Wise: Upstairs is better than downstairs.\n\nUnderground Business:  Lower Level restrooms have to be unlocked by the cashier whereas upstairs they are open and unlocked.", "author": "Carlos S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-13", "description": "Used to be my favorite Chipotle location until Greensboro, NC and ATL, GA happened *sigh*.

Thirdly, there are choices in your burrito making, which also adds to more confusion.
