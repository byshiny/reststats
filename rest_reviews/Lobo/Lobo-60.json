Its been a very long time since I walked out of a restaurant. But i walked out of this one. Waitress was SO RUDE!! I'm not sure what was even wrong with her. But she was livid the whole time she served me.\n\nI stopped in after a spa treatment to enjoy a calm, solitary dinner. I sat in the bar area to keep it simple \u0026 quick. Boy was that a mistake. She was really angry, like boiling over...and she took it out on me for some reason. Eventually she abandoned my table and a busser took over. \n\nAnd although all of the registers have swiping mechanisms, they claim to be cash only. What a joke! My spa is across the street so I'll just take my credit card \u0026 business to the myriad other restaurants on Court Street.", "author": "Darlene H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "This place is awesome.

Tex-Mex is a friend of mine. Lobo, you're no Tex-Mex restaurant.\n\nBut seriously y'all, this place is pathetic. They threw Velveeta on top of a few mangled pieces of romaine and called that a side salad. Also pretty sure the tortillas were made in a factory.\n\nThe disrespect some other reviewers have mentioned here, though, extends beyond the waitstaff.

Honestly the food is always just \"ok\" for me (no more than 3 stars for food) but I really love the margaritas and the service is friendly (usually sit at the bar). We always have a good time.  I usually get the passion fruit margaritas. When I go to Lobo it's because I'm really in the mood for a margarita and salsa and chips. The salsa is good and spicy - last time I went the chips were stale but they haven't been in the past so will assume it was an off night for the chips. \nI always get enchiladas since I love enchiladas but theirs is just ok a little lacking in flavor and a bit dry. I should really try some different items on the menu and maybe find something I really like--maybe more tex and less mex. \nGo for the margaritas and sit at the bar!", "author": "Heather B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-12", "description": "I don't understand how this place only has a three star average. If you're not amped when you leave here, you're probably doing it wrong. I started coming here on the regular for wings years ago. I can't remember what first led me here. Possibly one of the only restaurants near my favorite movie theater. Then one day I tried the ribs (!). Eventually I also tried the Tex-Mex fare too. You really can't go wrong. The garlic wings are amazing. They make their own bbq sauce, which makes the bbq wings and ribs fantastic - I like my bbq sweet with at least a little spice (and my parents are southerners and I've had wings all over the country and NY - I'm not easily impressed). Bartenders... I've had my favorites (one I sincerely regretted not being brave enough to ask out the one time I was there and also single when she was working). They're all polite, chill, and good at their jobs, and remember their regulars. Free chips and salsa, which are fantastic. If you're not good people, don't come here. I don't eat meat much these days, and I don't drink all that often, but I always look forward to coming here.

Well, Lobo has big portions. I'll give them that. \n\nThis is Mexican food as created by someone who must have read about Mexican food in a Reader's Digest from 1962. The cheese on my enchilada's was definitely American cheese. The salsa tasted like it was Ragu marinara right out of the jar. It's edible if you've just gotten off your time machine from 1960s Milwaukee and have never tasted good Mexican food. \n\nBut, for those of us who have...stay away. Don't waste your time. \n\nBut I won't be too mean. Have a drink. The drinks are good and cheap. The outdoor backyard is nice. Sit and sip a drink.

The margaritas are great and their entrees are enormous (I tend to go for the smaller dishes or the Skinny Twins enchiladas, as they are more manageable for me). \n\nWe had never noticed the garden area before, I love it out there, it's nice and relaxed. Inside, I prefer upstairs unless we are hanging at the bar. It's best for groups up there and cooler in the summer. \n\nToday, I was totally jealous of the boyfriends Shrimp and calamari ceviche salad, it looked perfect for a hot day. next time...", "author": "Michaela E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-07", "description": "Great food and usually great service. They are typically pretty fast to get you your food and it's always tastes amazing. Brunch. lunch, and dinner are always a great deal and full of great choices. I highly recommend this place.\n\nThere is an outdoor garden when the weather is nice and an upstairs with seating as well. There is a bar to sit at with two TVs if you want to watch a game.

I am solely reviewing their brunch menu! (I will say my sister and her boyfriend come here about every week for either dinner or brunch) I've been going to Lobos with my sister and her boyfriend for years, I would guess around 7 years, so I am a seasoned reviewer.\n\nThe brunch is so good. Their buttermilk pancakes are so sweet! They taste like custard and they seem to just melt in your mouth in a good way. BEST BACON I HAVE EVER HAD. They know how to cook bacon crispy without burning it and that's very rare. Eggs are flavorful, they pair great with the pancakes. Home-fries are pretty standard. I usually get a mimosa and it's amazing not to mention strong. While you wait they give you chips and salsa l, add some hot sauce it's yummy.\n\nThe customer service is amazing, everyone there is so nice! 10 stars for customer service. You can eat outside, downstairs, or upstairs. I recommend upstairs, it's more comfy. It's very hard to find parking so come early and prepare to drive around.

Nothing spectacular, but the food is fresh, flavorful and plentiful. They know what they are trying to be and they succeed. Service is prompt, friendly and the place itself is cute and has a pleasant feel. Seems to get a good eclectic crowd. D\u00e9cor is warm, lots of wood, with tacky (in a good way) Mex touches. They accept only cash, which I never appreciate.

Large enough of a portion for the texas sized that I would recommend this as an entree way over our other entrees.\n\nOthers had Guac, did not like it as it was one dimensional (too much avocado) but I dislike avocado so others might give it more.
