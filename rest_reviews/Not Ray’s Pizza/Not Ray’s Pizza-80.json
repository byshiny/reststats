The slice is hot and gooey and soft (I know that pizza purists do not like it that way, but I do). There is plenty of sauce and cheese on the slice. Those complaining about the $2.75 price could always go get the cardboard, flavorless, and naked $1 slice from the spot near McDonalds. THAT is not pizza, but bread smeared with ketchup.\n\nThe best thing about Not Ray's is its Stuffed Meat Slice - someone complianed about the $4 cost - hey, it is STUFFED with Sausage, Ground Beef, Pepperoni and cheese in a deep dish type of crust! See how much that would cost in Manhattan. The slice is a meal itself.

It's my favorite type of pizza, really classic New York style (not this crazy thin-crust trend that taken over as of late.)  I usually get their plain slice but the sausage and pepporoni version is also great if you want some protein.  Also love how their decor is all these photographs of places claiming to be \"Ray's Famous Pizza.\"  My two gripes are the crust could be a bit more flavorful, and they need to stay open later on Friday/Saturdays--I was crazing pizza at 3:30 once (granted I've stayed up past 3 am maybe 5 times in the last year, so this isn't a realy problem) and only Not Ray's would do, but they were closed.

It's not Ray's that's for sure. In all fairness, I've only been here late at night before they close or during the non-peak hours. It's on the corner in a really small space, there are a few chairs there but I wouldn't plan to eat here by any stretch of the imagination.\nThe guys who work here are really nice. The garlic knots are good and the pizza with the real mozzarella cheese is really nice too. Other than that it's not much better than any other take away pizza place.

However I was starved and also craving protein, so I went with an extra meaty slice that was twice the thickness and had pepperoni, sausage and other toppings.\n\nWhile hefty, it was also kinda blah.  The toppings on top were good but the sauce, cheese and underlying flavors were not very interesting, so I ended up picking away at it.  And the crust tasted like... undercooked dough.  It was cooked, but simply lacked finishing. There are places, even corner slice joints, who aspire to make great pizza.  \nI got the sense this place is simply content to get by.
