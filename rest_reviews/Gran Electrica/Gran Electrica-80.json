Why this place isn't a 5-star rated restaurant is beyond me. The staff and service were amazing. Since we're new to the neighborhood, we didn't realize we probably needed reservations but they had a cancellation and were able to accommodate us. If you can, SIT ON THE PATIO! It's awesome. So romantic and cozy. \n\nGo with a classic margarita or the spicy grapefruit. The queso fundido with chorizo was out of this world. We ordered the carnitas tacos and finished up with the chocolate mousse pudding dessert (can't remember what it was called). \n\nAll I can say is that everything from the food to the service was 5 stars so don't pay attention to the rating here. We're normally kind of Yelp snobs but in this case, I'm glad we overlooked the rating and we'll be back here A LOT!", "author": "Stephanie F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-13", "description": "Tucked around the corner from the continuing white-washing of DUMBO, coughShakeShackcoughLukesLobstercough and long-ass lines for Grimaldi's is a wonderful little Mexican place. \n\nThe D\u00eda de Muertos vibe welcomes you to this small restaurant with a lush, green patio in the back. On this particular day, it was, as the weatherman would say, hot as balls, so we opted to sit indoors. \n\nSplit a guacamole, which arrived quickly. It was topped with pickled jalapeno and quite tasty. It's that time of year where guacamole is so rich and full of good fats. Nom nom nom. \n\nI ordered the ceviche, which, while not at the level of some Peruvian spots, was cool and satisfying. It was a rather small portion, but it was filled with yummy fish. It wasn't too lemon-y or onion-y, so I was happy. \n\nOh and fucking Kanye West was playing on the stereo. Like College Dropout, classic beats. 5 stars. \n\nKatie ate her pork tacos hella fast. She's a self-proclaimed slow eater, but something about Mexican food makes her ravenous.

I remembered hearing about it when it first opened by kind of forgot about it. Upon walking in, I was struck by how....cool it was inside. For lack of a better word. It felt out of place in DUMBO; it felt more like a Williamsburg vibe, but not pretentious. For starters, you must be beautiful to work here. Seriously, the hosts, the servers, the bartenders, all stunning. There is a wall of greenery behind the host stand along with a neon sign for the restaurant. Neon was located very strategically and simple throughout the restaurant. It was a more modern twist on 80s chic (which, yes does exist people).\n\nThe bar takes up the entire front room and has a very active bar scene. The space utilizes the decor from the past very well and incorporates it into the restaurant seamlessly. There are a few tables inside in the next room, but majority of the seating is located outside; which is so lovely. There are string lights above all the tables and trees and greenery throughout the space. There is a brick wall in the very back that blocks the sounds of the harbor and downtown well, so your dinner will not be interrupted. \n\nMy husband and I each got one of their margarita cocktails and they were INCREDIBLE. I got the margarita de pepino. It was DELICIOUS. Just a hint of spice and extremely refreshing. When my husband took a sip he said, \"It's like jumping into a pool!\" My husband got the margarita de toronja picante which was just incredible. Gave you insane brain freeze though because it made you suck down a lot at a time because it was so tasty!\n\nWe split the guac, which was very flavorful and fresh. It could have used a bit of cilantro and could have been a bigger portion, but we were not disappointed. I ordered the veggie tacos and was blown away. There was small summer squash, caramelized onions, peptitas, microgreens, and some sort of creamy queso sauce. Just incredible. I could have eaten another order. My husband ordered the tinga de pollo and inhaled it basically. He just loved it. Each plate comes with 2 tacos, and I think a bigger person would probably need 2 orders of tacos. I was very satisfied after, but my husband was still hungry. Prices are very reasonable so this is doable. \n\nThe service here was impeccable. I want to say we had between 4-5 people attending to us all the time. I felt like I was at some super high end establishment, just without the pretense. Our every need was taken care of and done so with a smile. I loved this place. I would absolutely come back.", "author": "Joanna V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-27", "description": "Went on a Sunday night. Had to suffer through dinner with a DJ absolutely blasting hyper-vulgar hip-hop (I'm no prude but every other word was m-fer, etc) so loud that I had to yell to my date sitting across from me. Waiter disappeared for 10-15 minute stretches. Food is consistently ok if a bit pricey, drinks are better, but I didn't go to Gran Electrica on a Sunday night because I really wished I was bumping and grinding in a club. Oh, and there was some employee who was super excited whenever the DJ would play something he'd like, this guy would screech at the top of his lungs and jump up and down. It was just a really annoying scene that had no place in a restaurant. I get that it's part of Gran Electrica's \"vibe\" but it was way over-the-top and ruined the whole experience.", "author": "Michael S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-21", "description": "Cute spot! Best recommended for drinks. Don't bother to order the slightly overpriced chips/guac/salsa because the chips taste like they've been sitting in the kitchen since 1992. Fish tacos are pretty good. Capirotado is delicious! Service is EXTRA. I believe our conversation was unnecessarily interrupted without so much as a, \"pardon my reach\" to fill our water glasses after every few sips... at least fourteen times, zero exaggeration. Our waiter even asked to \"clear these papers\" within seconds of us signing for the bill. Lol. Final recc: pop in for a drink and a taco or two at the bar if you're in the area.", "author": "Britt M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-30", "description": "Amazing authentic Mexican food with a NYC twist!

We sat at the bar for about 45 minutes, ordered drinks and guac, and the guac took about 30 minutes to come though we asked about it several times.

Their patio is unreal in the summer - super romantic and lovely. \n\nDefinitely make a reservation if you can - it can be pretty packed inside. I had my birthday dinner there last month, and they were super accommodating of our group of 9 (if you have 10+ people, be aware that you'll have to go with a pre fixe menu). We were seated basically immediately and service was quick and friendly (and our amazing waiter did not complain when we handed him 8 credit cards at the end of the meal). It can be a little dark inside, so it's not a place I would take my grandparents, but great for dinner or drinks with friends!\n\nI get the fish tacos every time I go, and am the actual happiest person. The fish is crispy, the slaw is excellent, and they're filling. I usually hover between 1-2 orders. (I think it's 2 tacos to an order? I usually end up eating 3 total tacos). \n\nTheir drink options are also wonderful. I got the Ay Mami at my birthday and loved it.
