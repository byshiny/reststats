We ordered water and it took over 15 min for us to get our waters and the only reason we got it, is because we asked another waiter. The the table beside us got their drinks and salad before us even after they arrived after we did. I don't recommend the wings but we got 'The Pizza' and it was really really good. The crust was thing and the basil was delicious! If you come here, make sure you bring cash because it's a cash only place. The restrooms are gender neutral but it was dirty and not flushing properly... To conclude, Iwould come back for the pizza but don't expect the best service.", "author": "Carmen Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-19", "description": "As a native New Yorker I am proud to say that all of the pizza places that call themselves \"the best pizza in all of New York\" are lying unless they are Ignazio's. This was by far the best pizza that I've ever tasted. The location is great! I would love to see Ignazio's open up pizza resturants in Manhattan or the Bronx as well. This is the perfect spot to go to in the summer after a nice walk in Dumbo. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you are looking for the real New York slice than come to Ignazio's!", "author": "Ali M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-03", "description": "Found this place completely accidentally meatballs are amazing but unfortunate didn't have time to take a picture of them because It smell so good I devoured them in a matter of seconds and the margarita pizza was perfectly crispy crust just the way I like it not cheap water down marinara sauce great experience great service we will be coming back here PS don't forget about the awesome lemonade", "author": "Allen G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-22", "description": "Bring cash or your ATM and a healthy appetite.  Got off the subway not knowing where I was or going and made my way to this pizzeria almost literally tucked under Brooklyn Bridge.

The ingredients were used sparingly and the dough is really tough.

Sure, the wait was still long even though we were the first in line. Sure, they told us 5 minutes when in reality it was 25. Cash only and pricey pizza... but hey, it was good! \n\nWe got the special: avocado bacon tomato. It wasn't really anything special but it was pretty tasty. I got a cappuccino which took a long time also. But maybe that's their trick: make you wait a long time to get your appetite roaring.", "author": "Elsie W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-23", "description": "We ordered pepperoni,bacon and black olives pizza.

We went here because it was the closest place and it was pouring rain. The hostess would not let us enter the restaurant and made us wait outside in the rain while they got the seats ready...it was relatively empty inside so this was just rude. At first, she would not let me enter with the group I was with and that was just icing on the cake. \n\nI ordered a wrap and it was awful. Very bland, no flavor. We also ordered some pies and they were subpar as well. Didn't think it was possible to mess up pizza in NYC, but I was clearly wrong. \n\nDon't go here even if a hurricane is about to blow you away. More than likely the rude hostess will make you wait outside as the winds blow you away while they get your table ready and cook you some terrible pizza.", "author": "Taraqul K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-08", "description": "To expensive for mediocre pizza.

There wasn't enough cheese, and the 3$ extra topping was a few tiny pieces. \nThe crust was dry and not edible\nIn the check we got a 20% service included!\nHow rude!", "author": "Liav H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-08", "description": "The pizza here is delicious.

Big mistake. Although the crust was nice and crispy, the top was a soggy mess.  It felt like a slightly more upscale version of whatever local slice joint, except 3x the price. Service was mediocre.
