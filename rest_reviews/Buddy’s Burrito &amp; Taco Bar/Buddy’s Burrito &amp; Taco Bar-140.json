I got carnitas, which was ok, not the best or worst i've had. i forgot to ask for refried beans instead of black beans, but they did have whole wheat tortillas. i almost went to california taqueria down the street, but then changed my mind at the last minute-- kind of wish i had gone with my first choice.", "author": "Sara N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-09", "description": "We ordered from here last night. I had the brooklyn burrito with chicken, which was AMAZING, and my companion had the tacos with steamed shredded beef...he was a fan except all the tortillas fell apart making them real messy to eat. \nI agree though that their guac is seriously lacking. If it's fresh like they say it is, it's fresh from one of those packets. \nI'll definitely order from here again (and before california taqueria), but no more guac unless they find some avocados somewhere and start using them.", "author": "MK B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-28", "description": "great burrito spot in cobble hill.

The food just tastes good. Its not the fanciest tex-mexican on earth its just a rather large hole in the wall with consistent tasty take out food - you can eat there but I wouldn't.  We love the nachos (no meat) which are the best nachos I have ever had.  And their burritos are really really good. the place across the street is awful.  The fish tacos are hit or miss.", "author": "Julee W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-02", "description": "A really underwhelming burrito. The meat lacks much taste, the sauces are not noteworthy and the thing falls apart about half way through.

Huge, tasty, filling burritos.  Yum!  I like the grande steak burrito with the extra \"green\" sauce.

However, it is one of the places that I almost always make a point to visit upon returning home. I'm a big guy, and therefore I need a big burrito. A lot of Mexican joints say they have \"big burritos,\" but none compare to the \"El Grande\" at Buddy's. It's so big that they use 2 tortillas, and weighs over 8 pounds. Fine, I made that last part up, but nonetheless it's pretty enormous. My personal favorite is the El Grande with both chicken and steak, a mixture of both types of beans, cheese, guacamole, pico, and sour cream, no lettuce. Delicious. If you want something a bit smaller, go for the Brooklyn Burrito which is also very niiiice.", "author": "Jonah P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-02", "description": "You guys are CRAZY!

When they came the soft shells were a sopping wet mess and completely inedible.  I understand that tacos don't always travel well, especially soft tacos, but when I called them back to fix the situation, there wasn't a manager working and the staff couldn't do anything to resolve the problem.  They told me to talk to the manager the following day and they gave me his name.  When I called him he said he wasn't the manager and there were no managers.  All I could do was call the owner the following day.  I spent $9 (plus tax and delivery tip) on 3 tacos that I couldn't eat and have no recourse except to try to track down the owner.  That is ridiculous.  The tacos may be good at the restaurant but not delivered.  I will never ever order from there again.
