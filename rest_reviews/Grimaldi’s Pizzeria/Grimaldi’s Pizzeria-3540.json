I waited in line while the rest of my family went to the nearby Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory for snacks (very yummy). Once we got in an piled into our table, we kept it simple: half pepperoni and half cheese with the antipasto dish. Everything arrived and I'm thinking, \"That's it?\". Looks can be deceiving so I kept an open mind and dug in.  After finishing everything I'm thinking, \"That's it?\". I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what the big deal is with this place. I had better pizza in NYC next door to my hotel.\n\nI would have given three stars but I had to wait an hour to get in.

You may have to wait in a line that (at least when I was there) extends to the other end of the block. But it is damn good pizza. Damn good, authentic (well, at least more than Dominoes) Italian pizza. \n\nWe had the pepporoni and garlic and one with sausage and mushrooms. They were simply amazing! Fresh mozzarella on all the pizzas. I'm not sure how you can go wrong. You know, one thing did go wrong--our sausage was a little undercooked on part of the pizza. Scary for processed meat. They threw it away and made us a new one. Not burnt. Just done all over the second time. The manager that evening came over to ask how things were going. We mentioned that the sausage was a little raw, but that the server had taken care of it. He said, \"we do not make raw sausage,\" promptly got up from the table and talked to the kitchen. Really hoping no one got in trouble, that stuff happens, but you know, I like the proactiveness. \n\nHad all the desserts. Large table, fun for sharing. They're all great. But, um, the connoli was un-freakin'-believable. I've had my share of connoli, this was the best. If you save room for dessert (yeah, it's impossible to do), get the connoli. \n\n...and so p.s. and not really relevant to my review: how is the manager of this place driving a Bentley?? Just asking.

It is the best pizza I've ever had. And if you go right after work or for an early lunch there's no line to get in. But after my last experience there last week, I don't think I'll be ordering anything there anymore, not at this one. \n\nMy husband had seen a calzone the last time we were there and that's all he could talk about for weeks, so when we got there that's what we ordered. Unfortunately they put too much into it, so it took 40 minutes to get it. In the meantime, we were able to notice how the tablecloth hadn't been changed in days. And how there were mouse droppings in the corner - EEK! \n\nI'm pretty sure calzones come with cheese and sauce in them, but this one was all cheese. We asked for some sauce on the side and the server brought it out in a mug. The mug was all crusted over with sauce - it looked like it had been left over from somebody else. And the calzone was cold in the middle. \n\nWe ended up leaving right after which nearly made me cry as the couple next to us had a delicious looking pizza that came quickly and smelled so good. So don't get the calzone! And I'll have to try the Grimaldi's in Douglaston and pray its a bit cleaner. :(", "author": "Rebecca G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-03", "description": "The atmosphere is so-so, the grumpy manager is not making the scene any better.

Yes, we waited 45 minutes on a Sunday (plus 20 minutes inside for our pizza). Was it worth the wait? Well, not exactly.

My friend and I went to Grimaldi's on a cold winter night, after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, which definitely worked up an appetite. And going at night, or when the weather is not great, is the best time to go to Grimaldi's, because the line/wait to get inside is shorter and faster. Once inside, the tables are very close together and the ambience is casual and has an old town feel, with all the pictures hanging of the owner posing with famous celebrities.I think the atmosphere greatly added character and flavor to the pizzeria, which , other than the pizza, is a major reason why New Yorkers and tourists must come here once to truly get a feel of a NYC old style pizzeria.  My friend and I ordered a pie ( they only sell pies, with either 6 or 8 slices, and more I think as well) that was half pepperoni, half cheese. Our wait time was alright, only about maximum 15 minutes. During this time, I realized as I looked around that many tourists do frequent the spot, which added to the location's bustle. One we got our pie, the pepperoni on the slices were thick and savory, tasting very fresh and real compared to other pizzerias' dismal pepperoni cuts. The crust was perfect, not too thin nor thick, and had an almost  lightly-buttered aftertaste. The cheese pizza was perfect as well. A definite for tourists, especially after a walk across the bridge, and locals alike looking for a great bite to eat at great prices ( cash only!)", "author": "Jemi J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-06", "description": "A NYC classic experience.
