I definitely would not wait in line for two hours for their pizza. \n\nAs much hype as this place gets, the prices are very reasonable: $12 for a small, $14 for a large (8 slices), and $2 for each topping.\n\nWe got a large with mushrooms, pepperoni, and Italian sausage. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The Italian sausage was delicious and added a little spice to our pie. \n\nWe also shared a canoli, which was absolutely delicious!!!  The shell was crispy and the cream was thick and decadent. I'd definitely order it to share!\n\nLast words: cash only!", "author": "Matt S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-27", "description": "Got in fairly fast because we were only a party of two.

This coal-fired-oven pizzeria (I didn't even know that was a thing!) is tucked away almost under the Brooklyn Bridge, making it feel like a totally New York experience. The pizza was the crispy-chewy, fold-it-in-half kind that my Yonkers-raised partner has always bragged about ... and now I'm spoiled, too. After this, to say the local Papa John's just doesn't cut it, is an understatement.\n\nWe did find it odd that the beer and wine list on the menu had been covered over with opaque tape. Our server explained that they had forgotten to renew their liquor license. How does a restaurant forget to renew their liquor license? Tea and water it was, though not exactly the ideal beverages for pizza.", "author": "Eric P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-23", "description": "Pizza was fantastic.

The service was poor, the waiter only said \"its meant to be salty\" when we asked for a change of toppings (we did not demand a new pizza or refund. The pizza is not worth the money, please please please people, especially tourists, walk the extra 10 feet to juliannas and trust me you will NOT regret it at all.

Great pizza. I'd say Patsy's in Manhattan is comparable. As of right now Grimaldis does NOT have the liquor license.

I mean for crying out loud, I had to wait in the line out the door and down the street for over an hour to be seated, so I wasn't going to be pleased if it didn't live up to the hype, but let me tell you fellow Yelpers, this place can make a pie. Crust was great, really good sauce, cheese and toppings. I went for the \"small\" regular pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and onions. The small is definitely big enough for 2-3 people to share depending on how hungry you are. I ate all of it except 1 piece because I had not ate all day, so I was hungry to the point that I had a headache.\n\nCool place inside and I was digging the Rolling Stones they were playing. The staff is friendly and funny. They love giving you a hard time if you ask for something and the guy at the bar was telling me jokes left and right.\n\nThis place definitely proved why people wait outside in line for over an hour. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this great za!", "author": "Joe L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-12", "description": "I would give it 4 1/2 stars. Although the pizza is wonderful and the price is relatively inexpensive I think the place is slightly hyped. I came here expecting the most amazing ever in New York but I think I had better. When it's hot it's really good but the pizza can get cold easily. Thin crust, good cheese.\n\nSeating can be very intimate since you're almost next to strangers if you don't come in a big party.  If you want to come just to try out the pizza without waiting come at odd times (I came at around 5:30pm on a Monday) so I didn't have to wait but by the time I left there was a long line outside.\n\nOverall good service, good food, a good place to dine. But probably not worth more than a 10-minute wait. The surrounding neighbor is gorgeous, being under the Brooklyn Bridge and all. Maybe this is why the place is overrated.\n\nBring cash and a few friends so you can get a variety of pizza. Rule of thumb: a small regular pizza (6 slices) is good enough for a party of two.", "author": "Hieu P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-05-29", "description": "Since the move this place has definitely took a landslide for the worst. The customer service always sucked. But the food always superseded that. So I dealt with it. Flash forward to today. It moved to a more spacious, 2 floor mansion as opposed to its former matchstick box location. The customer service has stayed the same, they know people come here no matter what so they don't care. But the pizza sure has taken a toll. \n\nMy last experience was pretty lame. I came here because my relatives from Puerto Rico love this place. So I got invited. They came with an entourage of about 8 plus me and 1 more. Can you believe they seated us in the cramped corner on the first floor just so that they won't have to open the more spacious 2nd floor? Really! \n\nEven the table behind me stood in awe at the face of discontent we had. This should never have had happened. \n\nWelcome to NYC!, know that New Yorkers rarely eat here now.", "author": "Alexis M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-04-27", "description": "THERE IS NO ALCOHOL!\nThey don't have an alcohol license so beware if you want to unwind and relax. You will have soccer playing on TV and white neon lights. Such a waste of a Saturday night and it ruined the opportunity to have a fun evening after a hard week's work. I wish they had had the decency to tell us upfront. \n\nAlso what looks like the owners are not friendly and it's the 2nd time I am being barked at to wait in line or get to my seat. The young waiters are adorable though.\n\nPizzas are good though. I love the ricotta cheese + ham + mushroom combo.\nBut a good pizza is not worth being talked down to and  not having a nice glass of wine.\n\nIt's my 2nd time and never going back there.", "author": "Mara B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-09", "description": "Very neat place to go.

The place had a very casual look and feel and had a lot of pictures displayed that the owner took with celebrities.  The pizza itself was not bad but some parts of crust was burnt badly.  The service was okay but it wasn't the best either.   I was able to try juliana's pizza to compare.   It is not an accurate comparison sincewe ordered a different type of pizza.

Our overall experience was very positive. Despite a lineup, we got in fairly quickly. Our server was fast and efficient. The pizza was excellent.

Got the normal pepperoni, mushroom, onion, pepper (OK pepper was really good) pizza so I can have a fair comparison with the deep dish that I have had before and pizza here didn't hit the spot.

The sauce was good but a little bit too sweet for my liking. The cheese was fresh and delicious! Nothing kills the taste of pizza faster than overly processed cheese :/ . I just wanted a few more herbs in the sauce and this pizza would've been perfect for me, but then again, if you're into very simple flavors then this should tickle your fancy! Hah weird saying... Anyway don't get me wrong, I do enjoy simplicity in my food, but this needed just something... Oregano maybe?\n\nThe place is nice and clean and the service here was awesome!
