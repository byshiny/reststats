I love this place so much that it almost kills me to not give it 5 stars, so I'll start with my reason for the markdown: they seemingly don't have AC in the summer or heat (as I found out tonight) in the winter. It's incredibly unpleasant to eat there when you're freezing your butt off, and my boyfriend and I live too far away to take the food home. \n\nNow, onto the positive: this is some seriously good, seriously cheap Mexican food. Most items on the menu are around $10 or cheaper and the portion sizes are generous. The meat is cooked to order and is consistently great. The food isn't the prettiest thing in the world, but it's filling and delicious. Also, $4 beers? Sign me up. \n\nWorkers are always really nice. They take cards too which is huge. You order at the counter but there are plenty of seats inside. There's tapatio hot sauce at every table and there are a few salsas to try too. Pickled jalape\u00f1os are self-serve. Guacamole is included and the portion size is BIG. \n\nAll in all, this place is the real deal. I had someone tell me that the best Mexican food should be no more than $15 a plate and this place is the perfect example to corroborate.", "author": "Hannah M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-08", "description": "This place is great for authentic Mexican food.

I was looking for somewhere to grab take-out before taking the train home. Yelp led me to Buddy's.\n\nI had their steak quesadilla, which comes with sour cream, pico, and guac. I like that it came with all of these condiments - usually places charge extra.\n\nThe quesadilla was a very large portion size and I was really full from finishing it - I almost didn't finish it!\n\nCounter staff was very nice and my quesadilla was very quick to come out.

I came in for lunch, was not busy at all, placed my order nice and easy (just got a burrito with pork).  Two people come in after me, and their food was made before mine... (barring it was a solid ten minute wait anyway, which didn't really bother me, as I wasn't in a rush)\n\nI get the burrito, and damn, this thing is big (cue Michael Scott).  I could tell it was very hot, so I let it sit for a minute before attempting to eat it.  I grab some Tapatio hot sauce, napkins, and so on, pick the burrito up, take a bite, and bam, the whole thing falls apart.  I don't mean the normal, oops the liquid built up at the bottom part and started leaking, I mean, the burrito just torn and rice/beans/pork just went all over the place.  Ok, no big deal, i'll just go up and ask if they can re-wrap it, i don't care if some insides are lost.  I go up, they just say no, and I kind of go, you can see I tried to take one bite, it wasn't user error of someone who just has no idea how to eat a burrito..\n\nSo I have to do what I HATE, and that's eat my burrito with a fork and knife, since there was absolutely no way of making this work.  I have to say, besides the burrito being hot, meh.  It's alright, not amazing.  \n\nIf I lived in the immediate area, i'd probably come back to give something else on a menu a chance, but, I don't.", "author": "Justin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-05", "description": "If you are ever on Court St and craving some really good tacos, nachos or burritos.

I went to the counter where they had the chicken burrito which was a part of my order and I told them the mistake. The person at the counter told me too bad and that the steak burrito was now mine as I took a bite out of it and he threw out the chicken burrito in front of me.

As soon as I stepped in for a pre-movie burrito, I recognized it from years ago when I was here on a cold winter night. This time it was raining. Something about harsh weather drives people to Buddy's...\n\nIf you've only got a half hour for some filling grub, this place is perfect. Order up at the counter and your burrito (I got the Brooklyn one) will be ready in minutes. Grab a Corona or Pacifico for a few bucks more, and guac and chips to set the mood.\n\nThe burrito was good, definitely above average for New York, and generously portioned. I probably could have split one with my buddy and been fine. And the guac was decent too, though a bit too plain for my taste. Luckily, there was plenty of hot sauce on hand.", "author": "Yan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-02", "description": "Best Mexican food that I've tried in nyc .

I read a bunch of the positive reviews, so I had high hopes for some tasty food. \n\nI had to do some work on my computer so I got the wifi password, plugged in at the first table near the window and ordered what I think was called Buddy's Bowl. It was filled with rice, beans (I got mine without-because farts), lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and salsa. I also added some grilled steak to my order. \n\nTypically I would just stop at Chipotle when I'm in the area. I'm kinda secretly in love with them, but I wasn't in the mood for Ebola so I passed this time. Also, they're only a couple of blocks from one another so I deliberately came to Buddy's with the whole \"shop small, shop local\" idea in mind. \n\nSo as soon as my meal came, I dove in. The ingredients tasted fresh, but I was a little worried about the portion size. With all the reviews specifically dedicated to complimenting the large portions here, I was a bit surprised when I was almost done and not nearly close to being full. \n\nI decided to slow down my eating (which is not something I'm particularly good at since I'm a teacher and I often need to finish a meal in under 15 minutes). \n\nSo I finished my meal and sat there for another 30 min or so while I typed away, waiting for my stomach to tell me I was full. Sadly that wasn't the case. \n\nIn total I spent a little over an hour at Buddy's. Like others have said, there is no AC in the summer. Don't expect any heat in the winter either. I was in a full coat, scarf and gloves while I ate here. \n\nIn conclusion, the food is good, but if you're like me, you may want to order something extra if you're getting a Buddy's Bowl. Also do takeout and eat somewhere else unless you want to pretend like you're outside.", "author": "Lori K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-14", "description": "The food is consistently delicious, ingredients are always fresh and service is efficient. Most of their meats are cooked on the grill right after ordering. My favorites are the beef and chicken bowls which come with beans, rice, cheese, pico de gallo and salad. The burritos are also good and seem to be more popular. Food taste pretty authentic and the fact they sell beer is a plus!

Nelly would be thrilled. There are fans spinning but no AC and during a NY heat wave that's kind of a bummer, but honestly, it doesn't take away from the amazingness of the steak burrito I just consumed.\n\nI watched the man behind the counter cook up my perfectly marinated steak. It's piping hot and juicy as hell. I ordered the Buddy's Gourmet Burrito with steak (8.44 including tax) which comes with medium spicy steak, guacamole, cheese, and salsa. There were huge tomatoes and chunks of onions in the burrito, it tasted fresh and delicious.\n\nSo please give this place a shot.
