I can't ever eat an individual slice in one sitting. They make the best cheesecake hands down. I had the chicken parmasean it was pretty decent nothing to really for over but the portion size was enough for two eatings. I also ordered a slice of the sugar free cheesecake for my friend and he loved it. I took a bite and you wouldn't be able to tell it's sugar free, my friend is diabetic so I didn't want to get him a regular slice this did the job.

So, I'd visited Juniors in Times Square about a year ago with some friends and left disappointed by the tasteless food, but decided to give this Brooklyn location a shot since this is where P. Diddy made his group walk to get cheesecake on the old MTV show \"Making the Band\" and I had a friend in town who wanted to see what they hype was about. \n\nI ordered the BBQ chicken with yam fries and coleslaw and my friend ordered a burger and spicy fries. My friend's burger was so overcooked that I'm very surprised that her throat didn't close up from dryness. My chicken was so bland that I couldn't take more than a few bites. \n\nWe continued to eat because at that point we were both so hungry that waiting for a new order or attempting to go somewhere else  was not an option, less we pass out in the process from hunger. (I exaggerate and don't take real hunger lightly, but you get the point)\n\nWhen the waiter came back with the check, he looked at my nearly full plate and said, \"So you didn't like the food?\" I politely said, \"No\" paid the check and we left. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning here... not even for the cheesecake.", "author": "Brittney G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-11-26", "description": "Horrible customer service.took me 10 minutes to buy cheesecake.

CHEESECAKE. EVER!!!\n\nStraight-forward, to the point. We had the classic. We had coffee and tea.

I had little to no expectations so my experience was just fine. The service and food were not outstanding, but I had no complaints. I got the lunch combo of half a sandwich and salad for $14, and it was actually pretty filling! I had the pastrami sandwich, and while it can't compare to Katz's, it was decent. \n\nAs for the cheesecake the 4 of us split 2 slices - one strawberry cheesecake and one chocolate mousse - and we couldn't finish them. They were gigantic! I really enjoyed the chocolate mousse because the flavor was so rich. The strawberry slice was kind of plain. \n\nSo although the diner itself is just ok, the cheesecake is still the star of the show. Junior's is worth checking out at least once.", "author": "Helen D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-18", "description": "Absolutely awesome!
