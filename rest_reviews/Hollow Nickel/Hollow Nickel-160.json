Great happy hour specials. Large beer/whiskey menu. YES!!!!\nThere were some initial concerns with the service and delays getting food out. When these concerns were expressed, the manager treated us very kindly and addressed our concerns with total professionalism. The atmosphere was wonderful, the food was delicious, and the prices were great! What started off as a rocky night was completely reversed by the professionalism and grace of the manager (and hey, who doesn't have an off night now and then, right?!?). I would definitely go back and recommend this place for happy hour, dinner, socializing, etc... AND THEY HAVE A LARGE GARDEN! SCORE!", "author": "Karyn M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-16", "description": "Came here randomly after work with a friend one day just to grab a quick bite and drink. I was skeptical but I had to try out the place since all the reviews seem to be so great.\nHe ordered a burger which he said tasted good but he's a big eater so the burger which turned out to be a slider was quite small but tasty nonetheless. I ordered some sweet garlic wings which were pretty good.\nI'm a real critic when it comes to my mojitos but i ordered one anyways just to give it a try. It turned out to be pretty AWESOME! \nDefinitely a nice, cozy, chill spot. And I must mention again, GREAT MOJITO!", "author": "Willz S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-17", "description": "Great atmosphere and bartender. \nAte casual business dinner, average burger, very good poppers.", "author": "Douglas S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-30", "description": "Great neighborhood Bar.

Bartenders are super friendly and the prices are amazing!!! $5 for a well whiskey (which is Evan Williams and old overhault) and the food is really good!!! I had a burger that was cooked perfectly.

My fiance and I hosted our engagement party on Saturday May 4th, reserving the back part of the bar ahead of time with about 25 people or so. Working with Lori to arrange everything, Hollow Nickel offered us incredible flexibility and just made it as nice and easy as possible. The night of the party could not have been better. First off, the bar is gorgeous, and their back room was just what I had pictured when looking for a casual but elegant place to host our event. When we arrived they had put down reserved signs and candles on the tables that were ours, and introduced us to our server for the night. Our server was absolutely awesome! He took care of our large group all night (about 5 hours) without a hitch, and was lovely to each and every guest (so much so that all my friends are still praising him!). The bartender also did a fantastic job because every drink was perfect (not too sweet, not too stingy on the alcohol). About midway through the night the kitchen surprised us with enough complimentary fries and chipotle mayo on the house (which could not have come at a better time). \n\nEveryone was so lovely, thoughtful, attentive and overall just made it an awesome experience for us and our guests. I would recommend Hollow Nickel to anyone in a heartbeat!", "author": "Ivy F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-14", "description": "As a neighbor near by, I am into this place. Very nice dark ambiance. Good vibe. Good selection of beers. Fairly priced at ~$5-6.\n\nOwner seemed like a great guy.
