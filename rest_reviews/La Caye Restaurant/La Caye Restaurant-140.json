But the wait is a bit long and it seems that many of the dishes are spicy. To start, I am Haitian and have been eating Haitian food all my life so its hard to impress me...I loved the idea behind the dishes. The sliders, salad, and dessert, ect. But everything had a kick to it, except the dessert. There are parts of Haiti where spicy food is common but not everyone has the palate for it or the tolerance. I would have loved everything if it wasn't such a struggle just to get through my meal. But if you are a person, like my girlfriend who loves spicy food this was the perfect place to be.", "author": "Cathia L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-29", "description": "Nice decor, polite service and excellent food translate into the right ambiance to break bread with friends. Authentic Haitian cuisine delivered with class. Most likely because we arrived late they were out of the kabrit. No big deal, there was plenty of delicious treats left on the menu. Everything ordered was good with the lambi boukannen and black rice worthy of special mention. \"Prestige\", the local beer in Haiti is available along with a limited selection of choice wines judging by the very pleasant bottle of French red proposed by the staff. Definitely worth a visit if you've never tried Haitian cuisine. If you did elsewhere, I recommend a comparison with Lacaye - you will not be disappointed.

And I'm glad I did. Through mouthfuls of Creole wings, black mushroom rice, and akra as well as a few more rounds of Sak pase mojitos than we should have had, we gossiped, laughed, and enjoyed our time at La Caye. \n\nThe wings are flavorful and pack the right amount of heat without overwhelming your taste buds (but my spice-o-meter is quite high just so you know *blushing*). I eat black mushroom rice often compliments of my mother and sister, so I worked through the akra, which is a seasoned and deep fried malanga--tasty. Jean, the co-owner made sure to stop by and say hello and chat with us and the other patrons. Our server was also amazing, and her attentiveness was balanced (we felt neither ignored nor rushed). \n\nWe also wrapped up the night with complimentary cocktails and an order of red velvet. The red velvet was moist, tender, and not overly sweet. While it doesn't come with icing, the warm cake is nicely contrasted with two scoops of ice cream--and that's all right with me. \n\nLa Caye is a nice addition to Fort Greene's culinary hub. I had a good time and will definitely be back.", "author": "J M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-14", "description": "4.5 stars..a trendy haitian sit-down restaurant in brooklyn? Didn't think it could exist in my lifetime. Came here on a Wednesday night from LI: cozy spot, very nice ambience, very warm \u0026 friendly, half full..you wouldn't think u were in a haitian cuisine--hey no offense I'm just saying.\n\nWaitstaff were very attentive, fun, and as soon as our waitress open her mouth with her \"creole\" we realized she wasn't haitian at all. Very impressed with her and the staff's efforts.\n\nApps: haitian wings--nothing haitian about them but they were amazing, akra (fried fish fitters--good \u0026 not as greasy as your haitian aunt's would be, and the codfish with french bread was out of this world.\n\nMain course: I got my fritaye--a mixture of griot--fried pork, fried plantain, and ordered Haiti's well-known black mushroom rice on this side. THE RICE WAS just as good as my mother's, tasted very good. Our table of 6 ordered different things. \n\nOverall excellent experience and service I will be back..

I'm black and try to make the effort to support black businesses. I won't be coming back to this place. The bartender was very rude. In the context of a restaurant or bar, if I as a customer walk in, say hello to you and you do not respond, that's unacceptable. No one greeted me or my friend when we walked in. The bar was empty except for 1 person at the end. The bartender did not respond to the greeting I directed to her. She heard me, saw me, ignored both of us, turned her back, and turned back around and made a face at me. She didn't ask what I wanted. She looked at me, bugged her eyes, and jutted her chin out like 'WHAT?'.\n\nI didn't leave a tip. My friend probably did. Rude service always sucks, but it's always particularly upsetting and disappointing for me when it comes from another black person.

As a Haitian man who grew up eating nothing but Haitian food all my life this restaurant made me happy. The \"black rice\" as ppl like to call it was on point. They did not take anything off of it. Usually with Haitian restaurants, it's a hit or miss. They tend to sacrifice authenticity because they have to cater to the general public who's palettes aren't used to the spices of my home. Anyway, the rice was awesome. I had the diri djon djon (black rice) with fish and my friend who's also a Haitian woman had Fritay, which is a sampler of all sorts of fried foods. When our food came, we both tastes the rice first and as it hit our tongues we both KNEW we would be back to this restaurant in the near near future.  The food was A+!!!! \n\nThe decor of the restaurant was great. It's very intimate and would work awesomely for date nights for a couple. Their outdoor patio, which is where we sat, is very nice. It's also accommodating for large groups. I can't say enough about this restaurant. I will definitely be back there for another visit. This place gets ALL THE STARS!!! Our waitress was also amazing. She was very attentive and nice. She laughed at my jokes whenever she came to our table!

They weren't traditional sangrias, but they weren't distinct in any way. They were disappointing. We decided to switch it up and each ordered a glass of rose.  I asked the waitress if it was dry and she went on AT LENGTH about how incredibly dry the rose is.
