I am a fan of the BBQ Baby Back Ribs...so good...taste so much better than BBQ's. I'm also a fan of the Buffalo Shrimp appetizer, its the best. My second choice in appetizers is the catfish fingers! The sweet pea soup is good. The rolls are good. The creamy cold slaw is good(not the free one that they give you before the meal). Last, but not least,  the shrimp parm is another hot item on the menu.", "author": "Jasmine F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-19", "description": "Despite living in the USA for a few years it was my brother in law from the UK who found this place, which quickly became an object of my affection. I've been to the Juniors off Times Square and in Grand Central Station and purchased the same chocolate cake, which at $7 isn't cheap, but, certainly hits the spot (for several days if you're good  as you do get a very generous portion). The cheesecake is excellent and I say that as someone who doesn't even like cheesecake! I was partially converted by going to Juniors, although in my book chocolate still rules the day. I actually made a special trip to Juniors on my birthday a few years back for a slice of cake, whilst disguising my intentions to my little sonhey, how do you fancy a trip on the subway to Times Square to pass the morning great stuff. Btw: if there are several of you buying a whole cake is much better value.", "author": "natynatster"}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-09", "description": "food poisning!

This place is overrated due in fact to being another establishment of old Brooklyn. The cheesecake is pretty good, but not spectacular.

Baby Watson makes a better cheesecake and the chemicalized fruit poured out of a can than they use to top things at Junior's is sad. A much better bet in Grand Central Terminal would be Two Boots, the New York Oyster Bar, or Zocalo. Avoid the Chinese restaurant. The Italian coffee bar is fantastic, and the desserts are everything Junior's isn't. I think Little Pie Company makes better desserts, including cheesecake.", "author": "newyork2011"}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-17", "description": "By far the best Junior's location.
