Some came with my breakfast and I just thought I would give it a go. I was never so amazed at every bit of it being edible and tender. And flavorful. My friend and I had the best breakfast I have had in a long, long time. We have the eggs, waffles, tater tot's, and your choice of meat. Even their tea selection was great.\n\nOur server, and as far as I can tell all the servers, were aware and conscientious and attentive. It takes a little bit longer for your food to be cooked, because it's real food. They're back there beating up the individual egg orders for instance.\n\nThey gave us free doughnut holes because the time of day, and those were very appreciated and delicious as well.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Ciel D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-17", "description": "Went here on a Wednesday night around 7pm and it was nearly abandoned. The waitress was available for questions, which is good because they have some interesting things on the menu! The special sauce is a mixture of all your basic sauces, like mustard, ketchup, relish, mayo. We got it with our sweet potato fries and it was great for dipping!\n\nMy friend ordered the Supreme and I made my own burger with bison, \"green leaf\", baby spinach, cheddar, mayo and ketchup. We were both stuffed halfway through and took most of the fries to go. When they say \"green leaf\" they literally mean one leaf, so I'd ask for \"two green leaves\" next time. Other than that, my custom burger was delish. \n\nMy biggest complaint here is the price. $10 for an appetizer of sweet fries?! I ended up paying $22 for my burger, half the fries, plus tax and tip. A bit ridiculous but maybe I'm just not used to NYC prices yet. Let's be real, I don't think I'll ever get used to them.", "author": "Naomi D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-29", "description": "I went for the lunch special salad (since I've had many burgers here before) and it was amazing!

My husband was pissed i left a $5 tip.. he felt it was too generous. Oh Tiffany, fix your face,  PLEASE.  If we call you over,  we don't want to see eye rolls.  Smiles go a long way.  And whats up with $8 cans of cider? Boy were we side blinded by THAT one! So,  let's get to the food.  I had the berry blue salad,  which I enjoyed.  My husband however had  a $14 burger that was dry AF! My Cousin had the \"Falafelwraptor\"... it was wrapped in cabbage and drowned in 100%  vinegar and \"stuffed\" with falafel crumbs-$14 \nThe tab for a salad two sandwiches and a few brews was over $90... we all felt cheated.

I was walking down the street, not thinking I wanted a burger for lunch but then I saw these bright yellow garage doors that opened up the entire restaurant and a beautifully designed frame wall and I couldn't resist.\n\nI am so glad I came here. As if the decor didn't already blow me away (seriously, at least come by for that and TRY to say no), the menu was so explanatory and helpful in deciding what to eat. You have the option of building your own burger (bun choice as well) or you can choose a pre-made burger. They don't just offer beef, but also bison, elk, duck, turkey, etc. It's also very apparent that they care where the meat is coming from, which I really appreciate.\n\nI got the Supreme Burger (beef patty, bacon, onion rings, etc.) and it was cooked perfectly. Not overdone, just juicy enough. Typically I don't feel great after eating burgers, but I felt wonderful all day after this. Definitely think there wasn't a lot of grease on it either which was awesome. In the words from the man sitting behind me, \"Patty is a little small but, you know what, I don't need a big fat one.\" True that. I didn't think it was that small, but to each his own. Also, I can't help I overhear when someone talks loud and is sitting a foot away. Swear its not as creepy as it sounds.\n\nI had sweet fries with the burger and LOVED them. I felt healthy, while still not, and they were just the right amount of crispiness that kept the inside soft and potato-y. Also had the fried pickles to start and they were good, a new experience of sorts. The batter wasn't just bread crumbs, but also sesame seeds (I think) and other mix-ins that added a little kick. The dipping sauce paired with them also seemed to have more fresh ingredients in it. I'm glad I tried them, but I'm used to plain (but not plain) southern style fried pickles, so I can't get away from that.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back.", "author": "Kaley R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-04", "description": "Solid veggie burgers, but there were food remains on the floor and my seat.

The atmosphere is casual, a little rustic and cool. Two of the walls have garage style doors that were open the day we went so we enjoyed the beautiful spring day.  The menu is a mix of very healthy food with some items fried so if you watching calories be aware. \nThey offer lunch specials which are essential combos of a main item, a side and a beverage at a discount price. \nI hade the Falafelwraptor (GF) 9.55\nFalafel, Feta, spicy pico de gallo, alfalfa, cucumbers, pickled red onions with lemon tahini dressing in collard green wrap. Gluten-Free. Calories: 630.\nGot that with a side of slaw and a very generous sized iced tea.

I thought that I had tried just about all of their protein choices but I didn't realize that they change their menu up fairly often. It was great to be able to attend the Elite Event and sample the new additions to the menu!\n\nThe wham bam burger is out of this world good - fried chicken breast smothered in wham bam sauce (buffalo + bbq), topped with bacon. I also really loved the Lamburger topped with avocado and a yogurt sauce. I wasn't a big fan of the vegan burger we sampled which I think was the Prairie. The biggest surprise was the fact that they have amazing salads and brussel sprouts. I sampled several salads and all of them were great, like actually good enough to order them instead of a burger at a burger spot. That good. They also offered a really good cider that I had never tried before called Down East.\n\nLastly, their shakes are to die for. The vanilla peanut butter is great but the coconut, avocado,and lime \"Cococado\" shake (which is vegan) was the standout.", "author": "Hannah C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-12", "description": "What I like about Bareburger in general is that each location is uniquely different. Whether it's what's offered on the menu, the layout, or the service provided they all feel like Bareburger but it's like a different relative that you're meeting. They have different personalities.\n\nWith that said...\n\nI specifically like this Bareburger because it's conveniently across the street from Trader Joes. I'm kidding only 30% though. Like I'm either in here before I go grocery shopping or after but no matter the order in which it happens just knowing I'm going to Bareburger relaxes me. What plays in that is that this particular Bareburger offers table service. I've only been to one other Bareburger in Fidi and unless I'm unaware, table service is not offered there.\n\nSo not only can I get table service and get greeted by these warm bubbly waiters here, I can also get just as bubbly as they are because this location has alcohol on the menu. SCORE! So I get the great staff, I get the bubbly, AND I get my food delivered to me like I'm on the food network judging the chefs. The presentation of each dish here is always remarkable like is this even considered fast food? They always plate their food like they just know annoying yelpers like me are coming in ready to take pics. It's neat, it's good quality, and you can tell from the look of it, it's instagram ready...ALL.THE.TIME.\n\n:-*", "author": "Jana P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-21", "description": "Bareburger's a chain now, originally from Queens but now all over the nation, and if you've been to one you've been to them all.

Their fries are solid, they have beer on tap, and the food comes fast.\n\nTheir regular burger I think doesn't really hold up to Shake Shack but the specialty meats are pretty fun, and probably considerably healthier.

I felt the need to visit Bareburger again because the service and food were excellent. However, I didn't have such a great experience here the second time around. \n\nI came on a Saturday afternoon; it was rather crowded, but there was one table available. When the server came over, I felt he was a bit pushy. I placed my order which was a beef burger with cheddar cheese, fries, and a shake. The food was ok, not as great as the sliders I previously had, but that's ok. \n\nOverall, I would visit Bareburger again, but probably not this location.
