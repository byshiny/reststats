Got the Chimichurri sandwich which really didnt taste much like Chimichurri at all. Just tasted like a regular steak sandwich. Not terrible but not what I expected. Meat was tasty but the sandwich had too much mayo and mixing with the tomatoes it got pretty sloppy. Bread was nice and crisp on the exterior though. Go a side of Yellow Plantains and they were pretty good. Flan was pretty tasteless, my coworker said it tasted like the cup and yes a piece of Flan in a paper coffee cup is a rather odd sight. \n    Overall took a bit for delivery but being in Red Hook everything takes long, I would give them another shot when the Latin craving hits again.", "author": "Tory L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-11", "description": "If you're wanting some great Spanish food, this is the place to go. Not only is the food amazing. I've had the Cuban, the flan, the alcapurrias and empa\u00f1adas all AMAZING. The price is reasonable for Cobble Hill/ Carrol Gardens area. And let me not forget the outstanding customer service, they make you feel right at home.

They usually take forever with a delivery but today they were pretty quick.  I like them becuase its super cheap good spanish food.   I got the fried eggs with potatoes for breakfast and I also ordered a side of grilled chicken.  I need my protein.  The coffee is always super strong-AMEN.   The food is a little greesy so you need to make sure you tell them to be light on everything like the butter and olive oil because if not you can feel the heart attack with each bit. \nOver all good cheap and tasty.", "author": "Guido T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-10", "description": "What can I say it is typical classic Dominican Restaurant. Big portions of food which is quite tasteful I must say.

I don't quite know what they use for seasoning but they were tender, juicy, and tasty as hell.  At one point I found myself gnawing at the meat closest to the bone like a rabbid dog.

Their filete a la parilla or en salsa is excellent. Me and my coworkers always band together on Sundays (yes open on Sundays...yay!) and order a ton of food because we are hungry and sad that we are stuck at work on a weekend. Their beans aren't the best but the fish makes up for it entirely!\n\nThey deliver fast except that one time where they couldn't find the office but after we guided the bike dude on the phone to our building, he now has our address embedded in his memory! \n\nThe only thing is that they are a bit overpriced compared to other Puerto Rican/Dominican spots. Maybe because they have more awesomeness packed into their food. Wow...Yelp did not correct awesomeness. Did not know that was a word....\n\nAnyways! If you do eat there at the actual restaurant be prepared for a wait. It's pretty small and when I went it was busy and they had one lady doing tables and taking orders on the phone AND doing the counter. Damn! But yes eat this food!", "author": "Cynthia G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-26", "description": "This place is just okay. Food isn't anything special. Nothing compared to my mom's cooking or other Dominican restaurants I've been to. Yellow rice was bland, bistec encebollado was good but nothing great, maduros were hard and not sweet and soft. Lemonade was great. Chicharron de pollo tasted okay but too hard and dry. Could have had better flavor. \n\nWould not come back.

I have to admit, It was very enjoyable and the food was very well cooked.
