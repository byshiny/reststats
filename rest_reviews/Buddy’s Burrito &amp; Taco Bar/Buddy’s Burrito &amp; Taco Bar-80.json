Made in a hurry. Fair price. Flavorful, light but filling, and fresh! The burrito was stuffed. Delectable taste hit the spot [on my taste buds and in my belly]!!! Best burrito in a long while. The only thing missing were a toss in of a few chips. Chips extra $2.  I will surely return. Pleasant staff. Cash or credit.

The staff were really friendly \u0026 delivery person was super sweet.  All I can say is that the portions are very good and the guacamole, tomatoes, and onions are fresh and deelish!!!!\n\nThe Super Veggie Taco is like 1/2 a burrito, I ate it with a spoon because it was piled high.

All of them that we tried, their reaction was the same, \"yeah, it was good. But not great\". I could tell they were trying to be nice. On their last day we walked around the neighborhood and walked past this place. We were getting pretty hungry, so we decided to stop in and my parents ordered a ton of food (every other place had tiny portion sizes). On our way back to my apartment, our bag felt as heavy as a small child and smelled amazing. My parents fell in love with this Mexican place! They loved the southwest chicken salads. I still eat here every now and then. Definitely the best Mexican I've had in NYC and when my parents visit, they won't leave without stopping by.", "author": "Tia S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-14", "description": "Do not come here if you plan to go out in a slinky dress after. Do not come here if you are getting fitted for your wedding gown after. Do not come come here if you want that Scarlett O'Hara waist afterwards. These monster burritos go down swell and tasty. The Yelpers who compared this to Chipotle made me cringe..the food here is far yummier and filled more substantially. This may not be your authentic Mexican burrito, but this NY/Californian hybrid sure tastes fine. The shrimp Bklyn burrito has a flavor that has been lacking in so much fast food Mexican I've had lately. The vegetarian one is okay also. The service here is friendly, if laid back(read, a little on the slow side).\n\nI've seen the other Yelper complaints about cleanliness. I didn't see much to complain about when I came.", "author": "Helen Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-20", "description": "Went there today for the first time...

Unlike Chipotle, there is no vat of chicken or beef.\n\nThat's annoying when you're waiting.  BUT, it tastes really good!  And in a non-Chipotle type of way.  They use stewed tomatoes which sounds nasty but works really nicely.  And the guys are always nice.

I specifically told the person on the phone that I wanted a burrito with steak, and received one with chicken. I paid the delivery guy, checked to see if the order was right, realized it wasn't and called him back. He told me that he couldn't do anything about it because he had already delivered it (I took about a minute to call him back) I would probably eat at buddy's (in person) but I wouldn't order delivery again.", "author": "Sarah B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-30", "description": "This place has great burritos. They're stuffed full of ingredients, all of which are balanced in portion. The food is hot, fresh, and filling. Also, the guys making the burritos actually know how to roll them, so that's a plus. Like many have stated, it does get hot in restaurant, especially by the counter. That's only a problem in the summer; in the fall and winter things are comfortable.", "author": "Aatish P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-18", "description": "We get delivery from Buddy's a couple of times a month. I have only eaten burritos but the wife gets quesadillas as well. It works quite well for me. You would think it is hard to go wrong with a burrito but so many places somehow manage it. Buddy's knows what they are doing. The ingredient quality, size and taste are all very good to me. I think out of a dozen+ burritos I've only gotten gristly meat once. I get the chicken, enchilada pork (fave) and steak and all are good. The vegetarian chili burrito is another favorite and really excellent. Their beans are flavorful. The rice is perfectly cooked and the tortillas are always fresh. To me burritos are really a matter of personal taste. Over 20 yrs, I've yet to find one that matches the amazing, late, great \"Tortillas\" in Atlanta GA but I know plenty of folks who hated their burritos. As outlined above, Buddy's at least consistently delivers a good quality product (which you certainly can't take for granted around here) and one that I happen to like very much. Their service is always fast and courteous. If you're in the market for a good burrito you should definitely give Buddy's a try.", "author": "Henry M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-08", "description": "I get nachos for dinner from here more than I'd like to think about ... but they're always awesome.

Best tex-mex in the land. Mmmmm shrimp. Really shrimp. Not, like, tiny and out of a freezer bag shrimp. The steak: it's juicy. It's real steak. None of that shaved steak grossness. Yup, the portions are entirely huge so I often take my quesedilla to go and save it for later/tomorrow (this works best when guac and salsa are on the side). \n\nChipotle!? Seriously!? Gross. \n\nAlso the dudes are awesome. I practically grew up eating here.
