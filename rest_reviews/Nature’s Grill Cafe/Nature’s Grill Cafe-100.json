It is the chicken and bison combo wrap with the bbq sauce, turkey bacon and cheddar! Amazing and everyone around me had order envy. Even strangers were asking me what it is that I ordered, I should definitely get a cut of the profits from promoting this sandwich. YUM. Since I got free double meat, half a wrap was more than enough for me and I had the other half at home. I got a side of sour cream to go with it and perfection. This will definitely be in rotation!\n\nA bit pricey, but I guess since it comes out to about two meals, i am still winning!", "author": "Cynthia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-26", "description": "I'm a big fan of the Nature's Grill in Bay Ridge, and this one did not disappoint.  The taste, is very, very similar (which is a good thing).  I had the meat lover's pizza..and it was pretty good.

The menu has so many options to choose from, especially if you're not a full fledge health nut but want to try something new. The Nature BLT is my go to, along with one of their delicious smoothies and some wheat grass shots, I'm good to go. Of course they have custom salads and the option to create your own.

The staff are a bunch of airheads. I even smiled at one of the delivery person when I passed by and was completely ignored. Wtf? He wasn't even cute. The food was also bland and it took forever.

Sooooo glad I checked it out. I'm a BIG fan of their other locations, one in Bay Ridge and the other in Bensonhurst.\n\nBeen here 2x since I discovered this place and I LOVE IT! Everything is great! I love their Chipotle Sliders and the Salsa Steak Wrap! I walk into a place with a name, Nature's Grill and always manage to get the most unhealthy stuff lol\n\nAlso my favorite smoothie is the Maui Sunset, it has Strawberry, coconut milk, banana, yogurt, pineapple. Delish!\n\nStaff is attentive and friendly, and with charming decor, this place fits right in at the trendy strip in Bk Heights!", "author": "Angela G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-13", "description": "I ate here with my friend who is on the paleo diet due to some health issues. The name of the restaurant alone \"NATURE'S GRILL\" proves to be a huge misconception. I used to come to this place to eat because it was a huge leap from neighboring restaurants, however, you do not get the quality fresh, natural foods the way you think. My friend ordered sweet potato fries and called and asked beforehand if they were coated with anything, and she was assured that they were purely sweet potatoe. Naturally, when we went there, she ordered it, and again, for reassurance, asked the waiter if they were coated with anything  because she had food allergies and needed to be careful \u0026 he to claimed that it was just sweet potato. After ingesting them, she started to get flushed in her face and complained about stomach pains. It wasn't till then that she RE-ASKED the waiter what was in the fries, and he answered \"to be honest, we buy the sweet potatoes already made in a package.\" HELLO! if that doesn't scream out processed food then I don't know what does! Is this just presented better than your local McDonald's? DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU WANT QUALITY HEALTHY FOOD. Long story short, the sweet potato fries were indeed coated with flour, and now unfortunately she will be dealing with a flare up that she was obviously trying to avoid.\n\nNOOOO STARS if it were my choice but Yelp wouldn't let me post otherwise", "author": "Erika G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-30", "description": "This is my go to spot. Delicious food, friendly staff, quick service. They are doing some sort of makeover that looks pretty good too. Great prices.

It's unfortunate when \"healthy\" eating equals unappetizing food! The greens in my salad were wilted, the chicken was dry. There was ginger sauce was slopped so heavily on to the chicken, it destroyed any other flavor in salad. My bf got the teriyaki rice bowl and the bison tasted like liver. And we don't like liver!

I am not a breakfast person so I ordered the turkey burger and made it deluxe meaning it came with sweet potato fries and a pickle.  \n\nMy food was amazing.  The best at my table since everyone else got pancakes and eggs.  \n\nMake sure you ask for some bbq sauce to dip your sweet potato fries in.

Gave it more than a fair share of visits! They don't listen, it's over priced and not good healthy food it claims to be. Got my last order wrong 3 times and had to send it back \u0026 by time I got it I wasn't hungry then! It's only good for smoothies! Disappointing that food comes out cold! And we waited nearly 30 minute before we got it. I know it takes time but surely a baked potato with sour cream and scallions with a side of medium cooked steak is not hard??
