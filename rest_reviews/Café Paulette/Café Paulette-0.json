My husband and I decided to come here for our Valentine's Day dinner at the last minute. We don't come often. However, every time there was a new French bar tender behind the bar. Nonetheless, they were all very cheerful and interesting to chat with. \n\nThough, the wine list is not a long, the bar tender always had great recommendations. \n\nWe were early enough to get two seats at the  bar. The restaurant filled up soon. There was a Valentine's Day menu that included a glass of sparkling wine. We both ordered the pan roasted duck breast. In other restaurants the duck breast usually cooked medium rare and sliced. We had the whole breast unsliced and well done. It was a bit chewy, but the flavor was excellent! \n\nNow, the smaller space next door became a popular wine bar. People waiting for a table at the nearby restaurants, not only at Cafe Paulette, would go there to have a glass of wine, or two before dinner.", "author": "A G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-12", "description": "A wonderful neighborhood restaurant.

Interior is nice but limit drink menu.   Ambience is not very French.   They have HH from 5 to 7 ant the bar which is not bad but even at half off oysters it not cheap. \n\nApps was decent but the French onion soup could be better.", "author": "Judy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-04-27", "description": "The service here is average, but the waitresses aren't too attentive. It took a few minutes before anyone acknowledged that we were waiting for a table. \nThe food was not bad, I had the croque monsieur and my boyfriend ordered the eufs norvegiens. The salmon from the eufs norvegiens lacked flavor. The coffee here is also terrible, avoid at all costs. Overall the experience was just okay, but I much prefer Walter's down the block where the service and food is much better.", "author": "Qi G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-27", "description": "So I go in for happy hour. The bartender says wine is $7 a glass. I order 3 glasses of the sparkling rose off the wine menu she hands me. She neglects to tell me this is not part of happy hour (you literally just said it was), hands me a $85 bill then says \"oh I should have probably told you that wasn't part of the happy hour menu\"...yes obviously. I will never go back because she could have rectified the situation and chose not to.", "author": "Mike N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-05-27", "description": "Great location - wow! On the corner of the park. Cool! Beautiful sunlight at dusk. A dozen bootleg kumamotos for $54. Twice the size and twice the price. Was our average dinner for 2 worth $174? Not sure. Really amazing location though. The park is so nice. More expensive than balthazar and a fifth of the feeling.

I had the Croque Monsieur, and it may have been the single best breakfast I had in NYC.

We had intended to dine at Walter's but there was a wait as expected, and the rain put a damper on our be flexible plans. \n\nThere was a brief wait at Cafe Paulette, but my friends and I were able to wait inside before sitting at one of the booths by the window.  We shared a bottle of sparkling rose, which was delicious. I ordered the burger, medium. The burger was just okay which makes it kinda disappointing. The accompanying salad was tasty, as were the fries. The burger was kinda dry and I never got a chance to ask for more aioli because the server Just wasn't coming back around. I've had so many tasty burgers in Brooklyn, that a just okay burger for almost $20 was not okay. \n\nMy friends said they liked their food. The presentation was good-- the avocado toast with salmon looked amazing! We had some coffee after brunch, and that was decent. \n\nOverall, the best part of this brunch was the sharing of wine with two friends I hadn't seen together in quite a bit. I may be back if a friend suggests it. But when craving a burger, I'll likely go else where.", "author": "Maria M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-01-14", "description": "Just ate here.  Have been here for brunch before.   Last experience was good.  This one not so much, felt pretentious.   Had my biking gear on which was Ike $500 worth but anyway was getting stared at by some patrons.  The waitstaff also seemed uncomfortable with me there.  Wasn't offered a table and it wasn't that full, but it's like they didn't want me to be seen in a seat.  It's not like we were in Soho.  I felt I was rushed out even though it was in a polite way.  Just wanted to have nice burger instead of going to another place around the corner.  The burger was delicious.  Probably won't be back though.", "author": "Royce W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-25", "description": "This place was near our hotel and the online menu looked like it would work for all of our party, plus they were on OpenTable--which I always appreciate.\n\nWe were not disappointed with Cafe Paulette from the excellent Croque Monsieur sandwiches to the powerful coffee that will stimulate the growth of hair on your chest! The only things that keeps this from being a five-star joint is slow service and a slight lack of air conditioning. Our server appeared to be the only one working and we could have used a little more attention and air flow. \n\nBonus: They were shooting scenes for an upcoming episode of \"Elementary\" right outside the restaurant.\n\nBottom line: Quaint bistro in a quiet neighborhood of Brooklyn serving up solid food and incredibly strong coffee.", "author": "Warren D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-18", "description": "Love this wonderful neighborhood place! We always have a great meal...love to sit at the bar and just relax with some nice wine and a comforting meal. The only thing that they could do is to upgrade their baguette....there are so many great bread sources in Brooklyn now.

We were a party of six, 3 adults/3 tweens, so made a reservation. Even though some of us were 10 minutes late the others were able to sit and order drinks at our table which was greatly appreciated given the ratio of hangovers to grownups. The coffee was strong, food great, ambiance relaxed. Classic fare such as eggs Benedict came out quickly with sides of both salad and superb fries. What really stood out was the excellent service: our waiter was professional and attentive but not obsequious. He brought additional milk for coffee, provided information on the menu items, and didn't flinch at a poor attempt to speak French.

I have worked in the food industry so I am a very patient person...but come on. Only 1 server working today during lunch. Took 20 mins to be seen after being seated. When our food came out, we watched the server bring it to the the other table (mind you, we were 1 of 2 tables of customers in the restaurant). Could you really not distinguish between the 2 groups of customers you had? The server literally could not figure out how to run a card or poor a glass of wine (at a French restaurant) properly. As we were about leave, the server told a new customer that he could not sit at an empty/slightly dirty table until he cleaned it. 5 mins later and still hadn't even attempted to clean the table but had plenty of time to yell friendly convo to his cooks. If you are only going to have 1 server, at least make sure he is competent for his job! \nOther than that, the croque-monsieur was great.", "author": "Elliette D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-25", "description": "Terrific bistro in Fort Greene.

I could easily spend 3 hours in that place. Just sipping coffee, reading a book, or chatting with one of the folks there.
