Lions Heroes and/or Arepa Lady? Had them both before. And there she was, Bunker for the win with their Banh Mi sammy. Sold.\n\nHere's the thing with the Dekalb Market Hall. You order a blockbuster lunch, where the heck do you eat it? The tables are few and far between.\n\nI was able to sit at Bunker, they're one of the few vendors with a counter \u0026 bar stools. I ordered the Saigon Bahn Mi. Not the largest sandwich Bahn Mi I ever ordered but packed with flavor. \n\nNext: Dulcinea for churros. Not just any churro, I had each of them stuffed with nutella, peanut butter and dulce de leche. Mmmm\n\nFinally coffee (But of course) at Nobletree Coffee. \nSo far heaven! But I'm thinking, I'm leaving this land of Oz for dopey Long Island. I gotta squeeze in some more goodness!

The tacos were ok, they had too many people making food but they kept passing every order down the line to finish it. Two of the tacos actually got the wrong garnishes on them, so that could be why the food was off.\nWe also tried the Ample Hills ice cream place, which had a nice unique selection and the staff was nice, they let you try even multiple flavors.\nIt definitely a nice place but they are very pricey for the portions, especially being in Brooklyn.", "author": "Hannah V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-24", "description": "OMG... just addiction...and more addiction for all foodies...\n\nMy son and I adore this place...\nAs a lifelong Brooklynite...who has seen this area change and morph into what it is now...

I was on food detox the month of March, so even though it was quite tempting to try a bit of everything, I opted for what I thought was the safest for me: BK Jani.  The lamb chops were sooo good: really tender and juicy crusted with all the right spice rub and I felt magnanimous sharing it with my husband and son, who had the cruelty to tempt me with those crunchy- attractive churros later on when he knew I couldn't have it yet.  No, I didn't succumb. The roasted veggies from BK Jani had the right burn of spice which can be tamed by the cucumber salad or tatziki sauce on the side.  The latter, I had to skip though due to dietary restrictions.\nI am sure to be back in the near future,  on an attack mode.  I've got my targets: Paella Shack,  Arepa Lady, Dekalb taco, Likkle More and yes those churros from Dulcinea!", "author": "Penelope M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-23", "description": "Wikiwiki - I came to Dekalb market several times but have never tried this place.

No details required, just get the pastrami sandwich and you'd be all set. Also I tried Bahn Mi sandwich from Bunker, pretty damn yummy too. We walked around and saw the famous steve's key lime pie, ample hill ice cream, eight turn crepe, etc. I think food vendors here are a lot yummier than Brookfield Place or Urbanspace. \n\nThe reason it's a 4 not 5, there's not enough sitting tables. Given how many vendors there are, I only spotted maybe 4 or 5 communal tables. The rest were just one-off standing tables. It's quite annoying if you are holding onto a Katz's sandwich and dying inside to eat it but couldn't find a comfortable sitting area to do so.

Unfortunately, most of what we picked were just so-so.\n\nFletcher's barbecue\n- brisket sandwich ($13)\nSaw an article with rave reviews \"no need for bbq sauce as the sandwich is perfect on its own\"...not. I had high expectations because we saw them take out brisket that was super tender and juicy it fell apart a little as the lady was cutting it. \nThe brioche buns were yum, but the brisket itself was disappointingly dry. Slightly redeemed by the bbq sauce, I managed to finish it. Also, is it just me, or the sandwich is more like slider sized.\n\n- chicken wings\nIf you like your wings *smothered* with thick bbq sauce, then this is for you. The chicken  was on the dry side as well.\n\nPierogie boys\n- Potato and cheese ($12)\nTopped with caramelized onions and sour cream\nAgain, high expectations. I read that they make it as you order. But when they handed me the tray within a minute of ordering, I had my doubts. \nBit into room temperature pierogy, I expected a lot more. To be fair, that was my first pierogy - but when it tastes like potatoes and none of the promised cheese...\n\nNachos\nThis was pretty good! The chips were purple and thick, but oh so crunchy. Loaded with various sauces, it was a good one.\n\nTruffle fries\nThick cut fries drizzled with truffle oil, served with garlic(?) aioli, this was a table favorite. Although if you like fries soft on the inside, and not crunchy all the way, you may prefer truffle fries from elsewhere.\n\nMilk tea from noodle place\nWow! If you like milk tea, you *must* try it from here! I am not sure what secret ingredient they use, but this is a head above the other milk teas.

For me, it is super convenient to get to because it is right off the Q-train (literally, you exit the subway and the entrance is a few feet away). It is located under TRADER JOE'S (insert heart eyes) and the Alamo Movie Theater! So you can easily spend an afternoon here by eating lunch, seeing a movie, and picking up goodies at Trader Joe's!\n\nIt certainly isn't as crowded as Chelsea Market (hooray for those who ever felt claustrophobic there), but with comparable food options to choose from. I had the Pierogy Boys, which was quite yummy. I ordered the sampler, which was 2 meats (braised beef cheeks with pork buns and herbs), 2 mushroom and sauerkraut and 2 potato and cheese. It also came with bacon and a dollop of sour cream. The meat pierogy was my favorite, with a delicious blend of aromatic herbs, umami gravy and hearty meats. I quite enjoyed the plumpness of the freshly boiled dumplings as well.\n\nI think there is more seating here than at Chelsea Market, but that is not to say that seating is plenty.

Had an Arepa de Queso with shredded chicken which lived up to my expectations. Would definitely get again but not before checking out the other vendors in the market hall.\n\nPierogi Boys: Tried the potato and cheese pierogi. Not a big fan of pieorgis and wouldn't get a second time, but they were very good and filling.\n\nAmple Hills Creamery: They allow you to sample flavors and they even have an exclusive flavor that's only available at Dekalb Market Hall. I had one coffee flavored ice  cream with oreo cookies inside and an oatmeal cinnamon flavored one. Both were really good and will be back to try more flavors.\n\nDaigo Hand Roll Bar: I ordered the spicy tuna hand roll and the snowcrab avocado hand roll. Both were amazing. Fish was very fresh and food is prepared quickly. The only thing is that it's a little over-priced and not very filling so I'd recommend it on a day you're not too hungry and want some good quality fish. \n\nWiki Wiki: Great poke spot! Got the chili alioli tuna poke bowl to satisfy my craving for spicy food. Tuna was very fresh and the rice was very good too. I didn't like that you couldn't customize your own poke bowl, but the combination of ingredients was well chosen.

There's two already. Gotham Market and now Dekalb. The later is the larger. The highly anticipated opening of the Dekalb Market Hall in the waiting after the other Gotham Market open but it is a tale of two food halls. Dekalb is much larger in the basement. Plenty of choices for everyone from Spanish to burgers to seafood. Fortuna just opened and waiting on the Han Chinese to open. There's even first Katz outpost. The market is great for foodies like kids in a candy store. Prices are reasonable to moderately pricey depending upon your budget and taste. \n\nThe really issue I have is the lack of seating in this place. It is almost like the developers wanted to cram as many food stalls as possible to make money (Gasp) rather than making a pleasant place to eat. Unlike Dekalb the Gotham Market has plenty of seating plus outside plenty of light and air. I find it to actually be more pleasant of the two really. The food choices are more limited but that doesn't mean there's plenty to choice from. It just feels more relaxed especially for larger groups. Dekalb on a Sat can be overrun with strollers galore and they are all hogging valuable seating like squatters at Starbucks 'work' on their poetry. Thankfully, Fortuna has plenty of table seating and most of the time we just get to go which I think is that the developers intentions.\ner of the two.", "author": "David N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-12", "description": "I came here with a few friends last week after hearing about this place on Facebook.
