Always wanted to check this place out if I ever came to New York.  Well I'm here and since it was impossible to find parking down town New York we drove to Brooklyn and hit juniors.  \n\nThis famous institution looks just as it did when I saw it on tv about 5 years ago.  The food was great I had the burger which was perfectly cooked could have used a little season but was from fresh ground beef very good overall.  The bread basket with cornbread was nice also.  \nSurprising the beets and coleslaw were pretty good also.   I was disappointed by the cheesecakes due to the presentation.  I was thinking they would be on the level of presentation of Cheesecake Factory but feel short of that.  I opted not to get one especially after one of the ppl That was with us stated she had it and personally preferred that other cheesecake place.", "author": "Stephen C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-26", "description": "I'm so saddened and disgusted by the state of this place.  What was once a thriving landmark restaurant is now a mostly empty, sad tourist trap. \n\nThe drink menu is not really a drink menu. It's a list of all the liquors in stock... WTF? The food menu is equally dismal and everything is severely overpriced. \n\nThroughout the years, this was a place I came to with my family for celebrations, with friends after work for great drinks and dinner, or just because... Too bad this may be my last time. \n\nBrooklyn is dying!", "author": "Lora R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-16", "description": "Like the food but it's getting a little too pricey IMO.

In my opinion they have the creamiest and most tasteful cheesecake around which is what keeps people coming back.   As for the diner side of things the food is plentiful and tastes pretty good.   The dining room is clean and service is pretty good.   Parking can be a pain so if you can use public transportation or Uber then choose that option.

Ridiculously slow. I would have given this place a higher rating because the staff is just pleasant and always smiling, but unfortunately, my patience was wearing thin. I ordered a tuna melt (open face) sandwich. I have to say, Juniors is very generous when it comes to food portions. I'm also not sure that anyone can finish their plate in one sitting. I had leftovers for the next day, which is always a good thing. I love their steak fries - these folks know how to fry 'em! The tuna, however, was a downfall. It was oddly cold when it arrived at my table. My friend from out of state ordered a burger and asked for it to be a medium-well, but sadly, they got her order wrong and she ended up not eating it at all. What I can recommend for you all is to order their reuben egg rolls.

It definitely was worth the trip. Our host was a little pushy because we didn't know what we wanted but she can tell we were not from New York. The food was pretty good, I had pancakes aka hotcakes and turkey sausage. My fiance had a veggie omelette which we shared and their famous french toast which was really good. Before we left we grabbed a 12\" NY strawberry cheesecake which we were able to bring back to Chicago in one piece. Thank God I had a AMEX gift card because the food is wayyy too expensive.

Nothing really tops a good ol' Junior's cheesecake!\n\nJunior's boasts a timeless menu filled with American diner staples coupled with their own unique cheesecakes. For $8-$10, you can get a HUGE cheesecake enough to feed two people for dessert. Their favors range from sugar-free to fresh strawberry to apple crumb cake and everything in between! I was pretty disappointed to compare my sad slice of plain old sugar-free cheesecake (or \"diabetic-friendly,\" as the menu calls it) with my friends' decadent slices topped with fancy fruit and rich chocolate, but that's not to say that the sugar-free slice is bad. Junior's is the best spot to catch up with your friends over a cup of hot chocolate or satisfying slice of pie, and the ambience of the restaurant really adds to the overall vibe.\n\nWith all that being said, I'm still not a big fan of their regular food. Their burgers were dry and fries pretty bland. I definitely wouldn't call Junior's the best classic American diner out there, but I would dare say that their cheesecake is among the best. I usually only come here after a meal elsewhere, and the trip is well worth it.

Very appealing to the eye. I ordered the fish,shrimp scallop entree with fries. It was outstanding.

Ain't nothing special about this spot as far as the cuisine.  As a matter of fact I forgot all about it until this showed up in my feed.  Real talk I don't even remember what I ate.  I remember I was going to try the jerk chicken but this heavyset Jamaican lady that was at the table (we were a large group) looked at me like \"ya mad?\"  I might've ended up getting a burger or something like that.  The cornbread and the shrimp bisque soup was cool.  Other than that I might've well have ate at Applebees (FYI I don't eat at Applebees).
