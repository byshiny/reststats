We had calamari for an appetizer. The corn bread that they bring with the pickles and beets was delish. I had the broiled seafood platter which came with scallops , shrimp, fish filet,  French fries, and collard Greens (this was a first for me and I'm a fan now) The tartar sauce it came with was amazing. For dessert I took a strawberry short cake to go \u0026 a strawberry cheese cake. The strawberry short cake gets the thumbs up from me. The service : the waitress was very attentive and very nice.

(We did have soup, entrees, and dessert, but that still seems like a long time.) \n\nSo, after becoming used to being rushed in and out by staff trying to turn tables, it was very nice to find a staff member (thanks, Winston!) that was happy to refill drinks, wait twenty minutes to take an order because one of the party members was late, and in general provide excellent, personal service for an entire afternoon. \n\nOne issue - which is not Junior's-specific - parking in the area is horrific. If you don't have to drive there, take the subway. There were three garages in the area, and they were all full. We finally found a spot on the street a couple of blocks away, so our designated driver had to run to feed the meter once an hour. (This does help make room for more cheesecake.)\n\nThe food was good - I had the pastrami and corned beef combo, two rolls, one with each meat and fries. They were very filling. The matzo ball soup was amazing, and I am not a soup person. The German chocolate cake was very good, but by that point, I was stuffed. \n\nI'm sorry I didn't try the \"Something Different\" which is a brisket sandwich on potato pancakes with gravy. I think my arteries clogged just a little when it was placed on the table. \n\nThe chocolate egg creams were very good. If you don't know what that is, just go order one. I'll wait. You'll come back to thank me. \n\nWhile it may not be the same as in it's heyday, it's still a good diner. Plus, there's always the cheesecake.", "author": "Kevin G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-17", "description": "Gotta love Junior's in Flatbush.

I was in the city so I decided to go to the Brooklyn Junior's for a slice of cheesecake and a strawberry shortcake. I took my cakes back home to the BX and would you believe they sold me a bad cake! The strawberry shortcake was rotten. The preserves were sour. I kept eating small piece by small piece hoping it was just the flavor and I just gave up and threw it away. I was angry not only because strawberry shortcake is my favorite and that they are OVER PRICED but because I trekked there from where I was and it was out of the way plus an hour fifteen minute ride home.

I do have to say that their cheesecakes are very delicious, and unique in their own ways. However, I think their cheesecakes can be overwhelming. Their cheesecakes are too sweet for my taste buds, and a bit too heavy on my tummy. Everytime I eat their cheesecakes, I feel like I don't have to eat anything more for the rest of the day because I am so full. \n\nService was ok.

Well.... gotta say, really wasn't that impressed. I prefer a graham cracker bottom, but unfortunately they didn't have any. Only sponge cake- which I wasn't a fan off. They are also pretty pricey even for the plain.\n\nI also came here for lunch with some coworkers. I got a pastrami sandwich and ceaser salald. Really can't go wrong with that. However, my coworker got the french toast (menu item that seems pretty fool proof), and I could instantly tell by her face that she hated it. It didn't even look like french toast. I wish I had taken a picture. It looked like it was fried and crunchy- not adjectives that you hear when describing french toast. \n\nTo top it off, our waitress was lousy. Service was slow, and she appeared to have an attitude everytime we asked her something. Even after telling her that we were in a rush because we had to get  back to work, she took about 10-15 minutes to even bring us out the check. Mind you, she was catering to only one other table. Unacceptable.

Diner decor and classic music playing in the background.  My husband loved that he could get a beer in a diner.  I ordered unsweetened ice tea, which was good.  \nTo start, the server brought us a little bowl of pickled beets, one of my favorites.  Another bowl contained slaw covered with pickle spears.  Good slaw, but the pickles tasted a bit medicinal.  We ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with fries.  I had mine on challah bread, which I loved.\nWe returned for breakfast.  With an entree order, you receive juice and pastries/bread.  I got the vegetable omelet with cheddar, accompanied by home fries.  As hungover hungry as I was, I could not finish this massive amount of food.\nThe prices are not diner prices, which was the only thing that informed us that we were not in a time warp.
