I ordered a cheese and white pizza with broccoli. Pizzas never came because they ran out of broccoli. It was via seamless so the best option instead of sending one pizza without broccoli is to send no pizzas at all. We live in the only place in the world with a grocery store on every block but I am guessing that the broccoli species has become extinct because I can't imagine another logical explanation. Come on business owner. All pizza in NYC is garbage. Keep an emergency bag of frozen broccoli in the back fridge. Yes I would have been upset if my pizza showed up with no broccoli but I don't even like broccoli that much. No one eats pizza to get their daily dose of vegetables in. IF THERE ARE 2 BROS WORKING THERE THEN ONE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TO GET THE BROCCOLI.", "author": "Andrew S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-19", "description": "Do I have to give any stars? This place is filthy and by far the worst pizza shop EVER! I ordered my pizza which took forever. The men behind the counter were busy handling cash and food with no gloves while checking cellphones and ladies all at the same time. While waiting I had to use the restroom so I went in and to my dismay it was filled with trash. Yes garbage in giant black plastic bags swarming with flies. Both sink and toilet were unreachable. I'm assuming the staff uses the same restroom right? Immediately did a u-turn and exited the store. Went back to sit in my car looking into the Resturant in disgust.

A few desperate months ago I ate here for both lunch and dinner and got a little bit of a throat cold-- granted it was the winter and I was sucking wind hard trying to blow off the fresh slices. \nI love the widdle tables and the widdle benches and how there is no door so the people just spill out into the street with their pizzas like trash from a hoarder's garage.", "author": "Carl W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-27", "description": "When they first opened up they were excellent. The place would be packed all of the time. Now when I go in there it's to scope out the slices and I usually walk out. The lack of cheese is just sad. You can't even ask for an extra cheese slice!

That said, when the person making the pizzas decides it's o.k. to handle money, touch anything and everything in the place which includes the door to bathroom and / or storeroom AND THEN put his hands in the cheese to make another pizza, a big fat NO to that!! This person did all these things while wearing gloves but kind of defeats the purpose of the gloves in the first place, no??

Three slices only cost me $5 and I waited less than 5 minutes to have the pizza reheated in the oven. The pizza is really crunchy and the ingredients taste good too. I would personally recommend the mushroom if you have no problem eating them. The only disappointment is you rely completely on luck if they have what you want.

Why you might ask. Well because I'm convinced it tastes better at different locations. This location however is the worst. I had two slices and didn't finish either of them. I ate about 60% of each and when I got to be about an inch and a half from the crust I just threw it out. It was just dough at that point. With that said both slices (which were from different pies) didn't have much cheese or sauce and was just largely dough.

I really wanna go on a slapping spree at Pizza Hut, Dominos and Papa Johns. No wonder all the New Yorkers I know talk so much trash about those places. \n\nTwo nice large slices of pepperoni and a soda for just $4. Can't beat it. The crust was good and complemented the pizza. The cheese tasted kinda smokey. Just the right amount of sauce. Walk in, get your pizza, sit at a stool and eat it and then leave. It was great. \n\nDefinitely better than those jumbo \"I'm too drunk to notice this tastes like crap\" slices they sell here in DC on club nights. \n\nWord of caution: I don't think those two guys working the counter were actually brothers.", "author": "Ordale A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-03", "description": "They say bread is the cradle of civilization; a staple food that fostered life for the masses throughout the years.

How relative?  \n\nFor one, the slices at two of the Manhattan 2 Bros. I've been to (6 Ave and 37th, 8th Ave and 38th) are vastly superior when cooked well - thick crust with lots of cheese.  The 2 Bros. here in Brooklyn skimps on the crust and sometimes the cheese as well.  \n\nAnd for two, for $2-$4, I can get a better meal experience and better slices...at the VERY SAME RESTAURANT.  Howzat?  Avert your eyes from those cheap, tempting plain slices, and turn them to the counter with premade pizzas with toppings.  For only 50 cents more, you can get a slice swarming with meatballs.  For only $1 more, you can get a creamy ricotta-topped white slice (depending on what's available, with or without hordes of olives), a slice teaming with veggies, a buffalo chicken slice, or a full sausage and peppers slice.  \n\nEach of these topping-ed slices is a meal on its own for the light-medium eater.  For a big eater like me, 2 topping-ed slices is enough to fill me up.  And their taste, while not great, is definitely superior to the mediocre plain slices' taste.  \n\nAnd because the topping-ed slices have been sitting out for a while, be sure to ask them to make the slices hot.  DO NOT ACCEPT THEM IF THE PIZZA GUY BRINGS THEM OUT OF THE OVEN EARLY.  Ask him to heat it a little more, or you'll regret it while eating a warmish-lukewarmish slice.  \n\nSo to recap:\n- Avoid mediocre plain slices.\n- Topping-ed slices are good value and fill you up.\n- Ask pizza man to heat the suckers up until they're crispy", "author": "DC C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-10-04", "description": "First impression of New York...\n\nI was hungry and I couldn't ask for something more.
