The French name of this Japanese crepe made it sound exotic to my plebeian ears, but my dreams of a fancy feast were slightly dashed when I watched him pull out a squeeze bottle of French's dijon mustard (hence the French name?) as he made it.\n\nOverall, Eight Turn is solid though. The dude who took my order and made my crepe was nice enough, and my meal was fast, affordable, and solid. They even threw in some seaweed snacks as part of the lunch special. \n\nI'd do it again, although I'd spring for the famous BLT next time. It must be famous for a reason.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-30", "description": "Excellent service!

Look no further Eight Turn Crepe is a small shop that has the yummiest crepes. Their crepes are packed with fresh fruit and homemade custards! We tried the sweet Matcha Stripe Chocolate - strawberries, chocolate sauce, matcha custard cream, crushed hazelnuts and we had added a scoop of Vanilla ice cream. These crepes are shaped into cones, so you can eat on the go without the need of spoons or forks! They do offer both sweet and savoury crepes. We highly recommend you visiting this shop!", "author": "Karen S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-09", "description": "Consistently delicious, consistently great service! This place is located in Dekalb food hall in the basement of City Point. I highly recommend trying the savory crepes, especially the BLT crepe. They also have a punch card for frequent customers.

The bright stall featuring Japanese style crepes with both savory and sweet varieties called to us as we hunted for a dessert we could share. For $9 we got the Matcha Stripe Chocolate option which contained chocolate truffles, chocolate sauce, strawberries, whipped yogurt, Matcha custard cream and crushed hazelnuts. \n\nWe didn't have to wait long to put in our order and our warm crepe was given to us in a little bit less than 5 minutes by one of the friendly guys working there. The crepe was absolutely perfect. It was filled with all the delicious ingredients that perfectly complimented each other without being overly sweet. Next time I visit the market I definitely will be back to try another one!", "author": "Denay W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-02", "description": "I got the #2 on the savory crepes menu, which is egg white omelette with spinach, truffled mushroom, and cheddar cheese. $9 and with a student discount, $8.3-sh.\n\nBecause it was Saturday lunch time, the wait was about 10 mins. So by the time the crepe was given to my hand, it was already cooled off. The crepe was buttery and thicker than some other places. Only 3 or 4 mushroom slices and you really need to bite deeper to find them. But the truffle oil was very aromatic, adding extra flavor.\n\nIt was good, but not worth $9.", "author": "Jingqiao H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-29", "description": "Absolutely loved their crepes! I prefer savory crepes over sweet crepes so I ordered the shrimp avocado and it was delicious. The ratio of spinach, avocado, and shrimp to crepe was also perfect. Prices are reasonable in comparison to the general prices at Dekalb Market Hall and very well worth it. Service was fast and presentation was good as well. It was also very comfortable to eat and not messy at all which is always a huge plus.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-01-26", "description": "A nice, refreshing twist on the concept of the crepe, 8 turn was good but unfortunately didn't wow me. Perhaps it was the pricing, but we are in BK in a fancy dining district, so that may have factored into the experience. I got the strawberry Nutella, which happens to be the most popular option. It is a good size to share, especially after finishing a big meal at one of the other food stalls. Overall, it was just ok.

One of my favorite spots is eataly in Manhattan. This place reminded me a little of t-swirl crepe however the quality of ingredients here is much better. I ordered the almond banana Nutella crepe and it is definitely one of the top crepes I had. \n\nThe crepe itself is very very soft and moist which I love - just like a perfect French crepe. They give you an option of adding a scoop of ice cream or skipping which is also very cool.\n\nFor sure will be back.

I had the lychee crepe, asked for all lychee.. no raspberries.... it came with some edible flowers on top. You can also choose to have sauces to be drizzled on top. I had the caramel. Very good dessert! It was a bit soft though, so be careful when you eat it because it kept flopping to the side.

It was delicious. Takes a few minutes to prepare but well worth it. I loved it as soon as I took my first bite. My only disappointment was that there was significantly more sauce and less shrimps towards the bottom of the crepe, whereas the initial bites were a bit drier and compacted with shrimp. It was tasty nonetheless. \n\nThough I came in the evening, I thought it was really cool that if you order a savory crepe between 12 and 3, it comes with a free water.  Who doesn't love a good lunch special? \n\nI'll definitely check this spot out again when next in Albee Square/ dekalb mall/ citypoint- whatever it's called.

It's been very delicious every time I've gone, my one complaint is that there hasn't been more of it. Crepes by nature are pretty light and I got mine filled with eggs, avocado, goat cheese and sriracha, so it wasn't too filling. My other complaint (so I guess I have two) is that it's slightly expensive, but most things in Dekalb Market are, it's just a bummer to pay $11 for lunch and still be hungry afterwards. \nThey have a punch card which is nice, but you have to buy ten crepes to get one free, which means spending over $100 there to get one free item.
