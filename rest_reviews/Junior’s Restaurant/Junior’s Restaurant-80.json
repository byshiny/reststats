There are no half stars otherwise this would receive a 3.5 from me. It loses the half star based on prices.\n\nThere is also an Applebee's restaurant across street and a few blocks from a few small boutiques and fast food locations. Being there is no shortage of eateries in areas demands Juniors stay on top of it's game. Barclays Center and LIRR are just a few long blocks away as well as BAM including all the eateries that serve the visitors at Atlantic Center (restaurants there as well). \n\nIt's across Flatbush from LIU. Don't even think you'll easily find street parking here because you won't. The traffic is crazy around there. The Manhattan Bridge empties straight down the block, and the Brooklyn Bridge a few blocks away.\n\nThe location is handicap accessible with ADA restroom (not for other patrons) on first floor, and the restrooms for the rest of us will require you to climb a set of stairs (their private dining area is upstairs).\n\nThe first thing you encounter entering Juniors is their dessert and 'other' takeout counters. The restaurant is pretty crowded in feel. Moderate noise levels.\n\nService for us was prompt. One of the few deli style restaurants in New York that still provide you free pickles, coleslaw, and pickled beets!\n\nPricing is on high side for this type of food but again you get the 'freebies', the ambience is decent with memorabilia, and the cheesecake!\n\nThe cheesecake the star of the show. You won't find cheesecake better, perhaps beyond the sea there'll be on waiting for you. But if you're in NY and want to fly like a bird flying on cheesecake high you must make your way here at least once in your lifetime.\n\nBon appetite!\nCarson", "author": "Carson T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-12-03", "description": "I was told that this is a must go to diner in Brooklyn so my colleague and I decided to drop in for breakfast. Place looks very inviting from the outside and we were excited to try it. The breakfast dishes we got were good but the service was not. The waiter was short and absolutely not engaging with customers at all and not listening to the order requests. I asked for dry toast, ten minutes after my food showed up the waiter asked again how I wanted my toast and by the time I was done with my eggs toast with butter on it showed up at the table. Plus this place is not cheap for a diner. The cheesecake was so expensive that I skipped desert. For me this place was a one try spot.", "author": "Arkadiusz S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-24", "description": "I'm gonna be honest with you. When my aunt suggested we go to Junior's for a family lunch, I was all \"ughhh\" and \"aw, cah-mon really?\" If you're going to go to a diner in Brooklyn, it better have the best food ever plus flying tigers plus dancing clowns, minus dancing clowns, because that shit is scary. Anyway, knowing I probably wouldn't see any of these things, my hopes were not high. \n\nI'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised. We had 11 people ranging in age from 3 to 91. For serious yo. My grandpa is a mother fucking sorcerer. \n\nEveryone ordered something different. We had noodle soup, split pea soup, a chicken salad, 3 deli sammies, mini and regular pancakes, jerk chicken and the insane thing I ordered, which was a brisket sandwich with 2 thick ass potato pancakes serving as the bread. Because every last one of us is a fat ass, we then ordered 3 or 4 pieces of cheesecake, carrot cake, ice cream.....I think you get the picture. \n\nOther than Ben K. (yea, my brother is now also Yelp Elite ...*bows*...you're welcome) saying that his cheesecake was the most disappointing thing he ate (he still ate the whole thing), everyone was happy with their meal. It ain't easy to feed 11 Jews on Rosh Hashanah, and our waitress was on it. She even shoved a candle in a piece of cheesecake for the brother's birthday and sang us all a melodious tune. \n\nAll in all, for a diner known mainly for their cheesecake, this place did a pretty great job all around.", "author": "Lori K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-09", "description": "I love Junior's, there's something about being one of New York's oldest cheesecake chains that makes it so attractive. Plus, their cheesecakes are delicious! Although their other flavors are good, I really like just the strawberry cheesecake (regular cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry glaze on top). The slice itself is huge and is super tall to boot, and every bite is so fluffy and not too sweet - I'd agree that it's one of the best I've had in my life for sure. I'd previously gone to the location in Times Square, and that one is very touristy so I do prefer the Hoyt-Schermmerhorn location for sure. Always make a point to stop by and grab a slice to go after getting of the Q stop right across the street!", "author": "Carol L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-11-18", "description": "This institution isn't what it used to be. Bunch of lazy employees who don't care about customer service. Tried to call to see if they carried the tiramisu cheesecake at this location. After calls to both of their listed numbers and ringing for over 3 mins each I decided to walk into the establishment. No organization or system inside the at the counters. If there is a line, should you as the employee behind the counter follow who is next in the line and take their order? No. These employees acknowledge whoever is the loudest and can get their attention. What is this, the stock market floor?

I've enjoyed their cheesecake since I was a kid and is still my favorite which is why I've given them 3 stars instead of 2.  My review relates to the service I've received in recent years..\n\nJust last week I sat down with some friends for a going away party.  We all ordered our over priced bland diner food.  I ordered the very dry tasteless hockey puck style burger.. when we finished and asked for the check to be split evenly across all of our credit cards our waiter quickly scolded us and told us we should have told him this before we ordered and how it is going to take him extra time to do.  He advised we all pay separately but we said it is easier to do evenly.  He was quick to be sarcastic and explain to us how he can do easy math etc..  Eventually he did his job charged our cards, finishing the transaction by tossing our cards on the table mixed up.  \n\nMy point here is this.  If you come to Juniors just stick to the cheesecake and order to go or sit at the counter.  Don't expect to come here and get a decent meal or any kind of quality service.  Now there's some nice staff that work there as well, it just seems that Juniors has no need or care to deal with the bad ones..", "author": "Michael P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-29", "description": "Best place to get cheesecake in NYC.

Junior's lives up to the hype, okay. Yeah, I said it. We were walking down the street after our delicious meal at Hans Dynasty when I saw this guy on a bench eating this delicious looking strawberry cheesecake. It had real pieces of halved strawberries in it and a dreamy cheesecake filling and a graham cracker crust that promised of wonderful things to come. I seriously contemplated jumping the guy for the cheesecake. He laughed knowingly and pointed to Junior's front door. \n\nI admit that before I came to New York I never heard of Junior's. My friend kept saying that \"she had to go, she had to go\". So I said \"Alright we'll go\". I got to say it was a great idea. We sat at the booth and order three cheesecakes. Two strawberry pies and one pumpkin. The strawberry cheesecake is sold whole at the counter but you can also buy the pie whole. I think they ship across the country so I'll definitely be doing that.\n\nI did have time to take a look at the menu and it is quite extensive. Good old American fare. A little bit of everything for everybody. I felt that it was a bit pricey but it did look good. Might have to come back for the Reuben sandwich.
