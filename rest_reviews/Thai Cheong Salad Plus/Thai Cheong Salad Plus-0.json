There's a good variety -- not the largest I've seen, but they have okra, coconut curry chicken and other novelties not found at sub-par joints -- with an emphasis on sweet and tangy flavors.  It's fresh, frequently replenished and tended to, and they cover the cold salad section with sliding doors.  The no-frills digs are clean too.  Best of all, it even happens to be the cheapest in the area ($5.49/lb, less after 3:30pm).  It's no Jean Georges, but there's a time and place for everything!
