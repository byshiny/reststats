I can order via phone, walk over and my food is ready!! Plus they have a million bottles of malt vinegar for me to douse my fries in.

Enjoy the Cajun fries, grab a few in-shell peanuts, and be sure to get grilled onions and barbecue sauce on the burger because, well, you can! For no extra charge!

You order a burger or a little burger, specify the toppings you want, and add fries and a drink if that's your speed.  There aren't 87 different types of burgers, cause if you want one of those 87 types, you can just ask for the things that make it up.  They also do hot dogs.  It's not on the menu but they will do grilled cheese as well.\n\nThe burgers are made of fresh, not-frozen, beef.  The patties are small-ish, but the normal burger is two patties, with a \"little burger\" being one patty.  The bacon is generally really crisp.  Everything is very fresh.  You really can't go wrong.\n\nThe fries are cooked in peanut oil, so while they maybe aren't \"healthy\", they could be much worse.  They taste really, really, good.  If you don't like thier fries, then you don't like real fries.  I'm told the cajun fries are really good, but I'm kinda boring and like the regular fries.  A sign tells you were the potatoes came from, and you can verify this for yourself because the bags of them are stacked next to your table when they have just received a delivery.\n\nThere are open boxes of peanuts in the shell that you can eat while you wait.  Yes, you drop the shells on the floor, that's how it's done.  People with peanut allergies might want to beware of this.", "author": "Wook M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-11", "description": "This was the first of two Five Guys to come to Brooklyn. I absolutely love their burgers and fries. So damn good, especially to help with a hangover. Greasy goodness, and a big soda to wash it all down. I usually grab a hand full of the peanuts on the way out.", "author": "Andy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-07-03", "description": "Five Guys just opened in Brooklyn Heights.  It's basically burgers, dogs, and fries.  Everything is fresh and delicious.  You can get a single or double burger and choose your own toppings.  They have malt vinegar for the fries which I always get excited about, and they give you peanuts while you wait.  You have to order your own food to either sit down with or take out, no table service.  It's really really good, so go try it.", "author": "J K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-26", "description": "While the food is terribly unhealthy, I have to admit, if you want to cheat a little and indulge in a good burger and fries, this is the place to do it.

Like the beloved West Coast franchiser, this D.C.-based chain uses only fresh--never frozen--ingredients. You may always have a soft spot in your heart for the French fries at Mickey D's, but when it comes to cheap, fast food style burgers, The Golden Arches ain't got nothin' on the Guys.

I'm a fan of onions so I always get the grilled AND fresh onions, make sure you confirm this with the cashier before walking away. They always assume you messed up and the second choice of onions is replacing the first choice. It be better with a more varied cheese selection. Anyway, as you wait for your freshly prepared burger crack open some complimentary peanuts found in a huge wooden barrel. Fries are made from fresh potatoes and they stuff your lil' brown bag with 'em. Seriously they do, the fries are flowing out of their container like how a fat chicks gut flows out of their size 0 jeans. Then they top it off with another scoop of fries straight into your bag. Mmmmh maybe it's because of all these extra fries that we have so many muffin tops. Ima start lopping of stars on my reviews from places that serves hefty portions. \n\nDrink: Fountain soda + refills. You'll need it.  \n\nService/Ambiance: They take your order and hand you food, somehow In-n-Out does this friendlier.
