The classic at Hanco's has ground pork and is $8, which is not commonly found in other \"#1's\" in other banh mis. Although the grounded pork was flavorful and juicy, I would still prefer the typical ingredients you would find in the shops around 8th ave. That includes cucumber, more pate and meat, and a less messy filling. Haven't tried the pho here, but this area overall has pricier foods. \n\nThe thai iced tea was pretty authentic imo!", "author": "Carmen W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-29", "description": "I have the chain location on Montague street 4 stars, but I had to give this location 3 stars because I found a piece of hair in my summer roll. Not on top of it... but inside after I took a bite. Wasn't too happy about that.\n\nOther than that I do really enjoy the banh no sandwiches. Similar to the location on Montague, I like that they actually use big juicy pieces of pork in the pork sandwiches. I've had banh mi sandwiches from other places that use dry ground up hard pieces of pork in the sandwiches which is not for me.\n\nGet a stamp card. If you buy 9 sandwich/pho you get one free.

It was really crowded with only one table available, the one we took!

The flavors were amazing in the beef ph\u00f4; we both were so full but did not want to stop eating.

I live 2 blocks away from Hanco's and this is the closest I got to Vietnamese food. For that, I'm super greatful and will continue to support their business.\n\nMy go-to orders are:\nClassic Vietnamese Sandwich\nGrilled chicken Vietnamese Sandwich \nBeef pho with all types of beef without the raw slice of beef - this is because I usually take it to go or order deliver so the broth is not as hot as what you would get if you were at the restaurant. I think the blood kind of clouds the broth as well. \n\nThey have good bubble tea beverages with so many varieties. Again, the closest I got without going across the bridge to Chinatown.\n\nOverall, they are very consistent in flavor and I always know what to expect when I order food or drinks from here.", "author": "Melanie Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-11-13", "description": "Super disappointed. I ordered a sandwich and went to pick up in person. They asked me for my name and the sandwich I ordered. Then they proceeded to give me the wrong order....so frustrating bc it's so cold outside, by the time they realized and called, I'm already close to getting home.

The place was crowded.  The food was fine, but not great - there are better Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  The environment was absolutely awful.  There were a group of 8-10 teenagers who were sitting there before we arrived and remained afterwards and were not eating or drinking anything. They were loud, cursing, and taking up lots of space.  I understand that it's a reasonably priced place where teenagers can go.  But I wish that the restaurant would have addressed them respectfully.  There were people looking for seats and no one even told them, there are other customers that had to be served or that they were disturbing the customers.

I ordered a drink and a sandwich and waited for 25 minutes. A cold cut banh mi can still be made in under 3 minutes even if you toast the bread and the tea I ordered was pre-brewed. Seriously, this wait was ridiculous. Even with the people in front of me who ordered bahn mis, they're supposed to be quickly assembled. Anyone who's ever been to a viet super market with a little food court can attest to how quickly these are usually assembled by a pair of quick hands.\n\nCold cut bahn mi: \n1. sandwich bread was legit Vietnamese baguette which I recognized and can appreciate.\n2. I ordered a cold cut sandwich but not only was the bread hot, the whole thing was hot (this is how I knew things were a little off). The primary meat was not a cold cut but a type of flavored meatball/meatloaf. It was quite tasty, but not what I ordered or expected\n3. The pate is either non-existent, or tastes just like plain mayo. There was no visible pate (again, not very authentic)\n4. The quick pickles were nice, but TERRIBLY distributed. I'll submit photos, and you can see how all the pickles are on one side of the sandwich. I literally had to alternate bites on the sandwich and I would get entire bites of pickles, entire bites of meat.\n5. All said, it was still tasty but for the mistakes, I'm not sure it's worth $7.25 (especially when I'm used to banh mi for just under $5)\n\nThe vietnamese ice tea was pretty good, not too sweet, and still pretty milky. Warm boba? Not my thing on a hot summer day.", "author": "Nick H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-25", "description": "Just WOW, had an amazing vegetarian chicken Bahn Mi.  The veggies were abundant and delicious, the bread warm and crunchy just like how I like it.  I have never had vegetarian chicken and I was impressed, I would not miss chicken if I could get this everywhere.  I also got the \"real\" chicken spring rolls, also delicious.

And Hanco's fits the bill. I used to get the grilled pork, but have since locked my sights on the CLASSIC Banh Mi Sandwich. Why you ask? Because the crumbly goodness of the ground pork, that is why! And you know what I also enjoy? Licking all those lil crumbled morsels, that couldn't be contained in the crispy bread boat, off the paper. Judge not!....unless YE BE JUDGED, unless you are one of those \"classy\" eaters, then judge away.....and actually let me lick your paper.\n\nI finally got to try the Beef Pho. And really it left me a bit underwhelmed. My issues were it wasn't the most flavorful pho broth I've had and second it had TONS of cartilage. I wasn't shocked to find it in a Vietnamese dish since it is often used, BUT I ordered the beef. It should be the SPECIAL or TRADITIONAL if its going to be anything more than the beef. In my case, my wife is more Barbarian than I so she ate each jelly/bone textured bit. I gag just thinking about it. Therefore I will pass on the Pho in the Phuture.\n\nLesson of the day: GET the classic banh mi and let your Barbarian wife chomp on cartilage....SAVAGE.", "author": "Mike S."}], "servesCuisine": "Vietnamese", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Hanco\u2019s", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "134 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/N3l6obrY6QZNhueAeuwRiA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188586818"}
