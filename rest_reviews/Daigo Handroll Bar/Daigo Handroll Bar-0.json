My boyfriend and I split four rolls between us. The spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and yellowtail handrolls were all tasty and simple enough - fish and warm rice wrapped in nori. My favorite handroll, however, was the seared salmon belly with fresh scallions, which was the special of the day. All the rolls were prepared quickly and handed to us directly - no plates, no silverware, no problem.\n\nThe price is the main reason I will not turn into a Daigo regular, although I would repeat this experience occasionally. At roughly $7 per roll, these price tags are a bit high for such small, simple rolls. With that said, this is an easy, delicious way to satisfy your sushi cravings and possibly my new favorite stand at the Dekalb Market.", "author": "Nataliya M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-03-08", "description": "I've never been a big handroll guy. \n\nMy mom (and only my mom) will tell you I'm a handsome guy.\nNo one will tell you I'm a handy guy. \nI tried to be a handkerchief guy, but it didn't take.\nI'm becoming a Handmaid's Tale guy, sort of.\n\nBut I've never been a big handroll guy (nor a handcuffed guy...never been caught). Because you have to really love the nori to love the handroll, and it's never been my favorite aspect of sushi. \n\nDaigo (and KazuNori, if you've been) is changing my mind. When the fish is fresh and light, the rice properly seasoned, and the nori is crisp and perfect...I understand why people love the handroll. \n\nYou have to eat it instantly to get the full effect, and Daigo does it right.\n\nIt's a little on the steep side pricewise (more expensive even than KazuNori), but I love that you can come by and grab one roll, scarf it and go.

I enjoyed the concept, and it satisfied my sushi craving during lunch. \n\nHowever, as far as convenience goes the quality of the sushi is sub-par and not worth the price (around $8-$10 for a single roll). The proportions were small - so I ordered two rolls and it was enough to satisfied my hunger that costed close to $20. I ordered this to go since I was running late heading back to work, along with several others that also ordered it in to go containers versus sitting at the bar stools next to the stand. The stand have high volume, which caused a longer wait time than I expected. Initially, there were only one sushi chef however once the line started getting longer a second support chef walked in. \n\nOverall, it is a good concept and worth trying once.", "author": "Jenny L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-22", "description": "100/100 every time.

I've always detoured my way through Dekalb Market Hall to go to Trader Joe's but Daigo might just be the reason to make me make a pit stop each time (well...maybe only as an occasional treat because prices are a bit steep). Ordering and paying is simple as can be. You basically stand there and mark off on the simple order sheet what handrolls you want to eat and the chef makes them for you one at a time (he'll only give you your second one once he sees that you've finished your first). Once you've finished dining, you bring your order sheet to the cashier, pay, and go.\n\nThe rice was soft, sweet, warm, and fluffy. The eel and avocado were super fresh.
