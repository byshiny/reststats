They are delicious and the bad is huge!  The burgers are good but are nothing to brag about, who cares about all those toppings? I never get more than a couple toppings anyhow.

Yes! the waiting. First of all you get free nuts while you wait. Before the waiting process, you order of course duh! After that they give you a option on the size or type of burger you want. Second: after choosing your meal its heaven after that. well apart from the bill (i spent $17.98 on a burger meal for two.) They ask you for the topping you desire. Its endless amount of toppings. During the wait you get free fresh peanuts. When you finally get the burger: the size is perfect, the fries are plenty, the toppings are delicious, the veggies are fresh and put it all together it is just heaven. Well if heaven was filled with fantastic burgers. The bottom line is that its a little expensive if you're planning on eating just a fast food lunch. But it taste good. Its worth at least a try.", "author": "Brian C."}], "servesCuisine": "Burgers", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Five Guys", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "138 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/MaqhcMKeIHwWIrswCXtNoA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187979380"}
