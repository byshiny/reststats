Our waiter was funny, he told us to put away our phones, but then took a photo of us with the pizza and surprised us with free dessert, not just any dessert, CANNOLI!!! Stop reading reviews, just go you won't regret it. It is worth the wait, the line is long but the pizza is worth it. I am back in California and my friends thought it would be a good idea to get pizza from a local place, after Grimaldi's no other pizza will ever compare!", "author": "Rose H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-05", "description": "Tourist trap? Yes.\nWorth the wait? No.\n\nThe pizza here is good, but not amazing to justify waiting over an hour. I've been here a couple times and generally, their pizza dough is soft, but also a bit burnt and ashy on the bottom. \n\nTip: If you get too many toppings it will get soggy. Pizza comes out hot and fresh from the oven, so be careful not to burn yourself.\n\nI like to take my tourist friends here for dinner then along the promenade at night to see the Manhattan skyline while enjoying ice cream.", "author": "Katrina L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "This is our first stop at New York. Cant go wrong with a brooklyn slice pizza. everything about the pizza is awesome! The toppings was on point, got the regular pepperoni and sausage. The sauce and cheese is what separates this from any other pizza place. The mozzarella is fresh, and stringy. The sauce is simply imported marzilla sauce tomatoes simmered down to a saucy-like consistency. It was a slice of heaven. One of my favorite pizza's in NYC!

I don't think I'd ever wait in line and hype this up and I'm glad I didn't because I probably might have knocked it to a two star review. \n\nThe service is ok, on the slower side and the \"host\" guy at the front isn't the happiest of people. Yeah i get your dealing with a bunch of clueless tourists most of the time but its expected. \n\nThe small pizza is perfect two, you may even have a leftover slice, although we did see one guy take down a whole small pizza so i guess it varies....\n\nOverall, glad I got a taste, but there are days a good ol' $1 slice could win out here.", "author": "Chris W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-31", "description": "LINES!!!!!!  But, don't be TOO discouraged because it does move rather quick and it's worth the wait!  The pizza is DELICIOUS!\n\nI'm from SF so normally the pizza crust is rather fluffy and very filling.  these pizzas are made with very thin crust so what is one SF pizza slice = 2 NY slices just because you don't have all the bread expanding in your belly.  Don't be intimidated by ordering a LARGE PIZZA.\n\nwe came at 10:15pm and it's hard to believe but there was still a line of people half way down the block.  i was initially put off by the idea of waiting for a pizza but we actually got seated rather quickly since there was only 2 of us.  there's a lot of large groups so the host will walk down the line picking and choosing who is up next to try their savory slices of pizza.\n\nwe were debating between the medium and large and looking around all tables including 2 ordered large so we thought WHY NOT.  let me tell you.... you will be STUFFED but you will enjoy every single bite.  If you're from SF, don't be intimidated!  I have a pretty small stomach and we only had one slice of pizza left.\n\nwe ordered half and half of margarita and sausage mushroom.  the crust is thin, the cheesy is oozing and gooey, the sauce completes the entire meal.  add a drink to your pizza and total out the door for two people is under $30 including tip!  AMAZING!\n\nMy only hesitation going back is those lines.

The garlicky flavor of the white pizza is definitely worth the wait...although I did wait about 1.5 hours (Sunday at 6:30pm, seated at 8ish). \n\nThe pizzas don't even really need any toppings though we got one tomato with pepperoni and one white with sausage. \n\nThe line moves fast if you are only a party of 2. We kept seeing people get pulled to the front and get seated. \n\nThe BEST part of this location is the view of the manhattan skyline. It's so beautiful!!

The staff did not look happy to get customers, and we did not feel welcome.\n\nThey do not have pre-defined pizzas, instead you have to create your own from a list of ingredients. We chose italian sausage, meatballs and jalapenos. All the pizzas come with mozzarella and tomatos as standard. \n\nIn our opinion the pizza was substandard, and too expensive for what you get.

I have visited the original Brooklyn place a couple of times and now also the one located in Fort Myers, FL. \nIts just downright good crispy, flavorful pizza with quality fresh ingredients. The salads are huge and are great to share. I love the simple dressing used for the salad. Nothing too cumbersome or overwhelming. The pizza which I shared with another person was huge and we loved every bite of it. This is PIZZA man.. Not imitation in any way.

This was easily the WORST pie I've eaten in NYC in decades.  To begin, the $12 antipasto is 6 slices of cheap\n sandwich salami, 3 olives, 4 pieces of rubbery, tasteless,\"fresh\" mozzarella and a few pieces of cold cooked dough, all served on a paper plate.  The pie wasn't much better.  The crust was flat and hard and tasteless.  The outer 2/3s of the slice were impossible to cut with a knife and fork.  Easily the most souless crust I've ever had. The sauce was average and the cheese tasteless.  All very sad as I remember how delicious the pies were when they were down the street.  Perhaps their new oven doesn't get up to temp and they've obviously skimped on quality, care and soul.\nAlso, I noted they were making people stand in line outside while there were plenty of empty seats inside to make it look like there was some kind of demand.  The faux-hardass bouncer doorman didn't help much either, but perhaps he impresses the tourists?  \nSpeaking of, there were tourists all around me and I truly felt sorry that they were wasting a meal here and thinking this was one of NY's best.  Sad!  \nAVOID AVOID AVOID.  I've had dollar slices that were 100x better.  I've had pizza in the midwest that was 1000x better.
