This limits the enjoyment of this piece of divinity to those who work near downtown Brooklyn... and to the likes of me! Once again, I procured a hotel room in Brooklyn Heights, worked remotely from Brooklyn on a Friday, and ordered three beef sloppy pavs for delivery. \n\nThe sloppy pav is an Indian take on sloppy joe sliders. The mini buns are stuffed with tender and moist short rib that is braised with spices and black cardamom, which makes it flavorful and aromatic. It comes with masala chips and a side of jalapeno aioli. I requested the restaurant not to put lettuce and tomato on my pavs (those \"veggies\" just don't belong in a sloppy pav). I also requested an extra side of the jalapeno aioli, which I added to my already moist and tasty sloppy pav; and that, my friends, took it to yet another level of deliciousness! \n\nIf you work near downtown Brooklyn, or just happen to be in the area during the day on a weekday, I would highly recommend trying this delectable treat.

So I have PTSD which makes remembering events and other information extremely difficult  sometimes. I didn't remember eating here before, but when I read my review, I thought, it must have been good for me to give 5 stars. \n\nIt seems unfortunately that a lesson must be taught on how to communicate with customers and provide the best service possible. \n\nI had an old Restaurant.com voucher for this place. I showed it to the person at the storefront from my iPad. She told me the restaurant doesn't honor it anymore. I said, \"then you should tell Restaurant.com so they can remove the offer.\" She said, \"Come back tomorrow when the owner is here.\" Come back tomorrow?! Seriously? That is what you tell vendors, not potential customers. \n\nI decided to eat there anyway, again having no memory of eating there before. I sat down and asked for a menu. I will skip the details of what happens next. In short, the hostess/waitress treated me like I was a tourist who doesn't tip. (Sorry European tourists; the bias is true.) After time passed and different staff went by, I got up and left. \n\nMaybe I will return when one of the owners is there.

To get out of her way, we took a seat while we waited. For 40 minutes. (We were told 15-20.) The woman barely acknowledged us as we waited even longer to pay.

I'd give it a single star, but the food was not too bad (not great, but not too bad). Problem was the customer experience overall.  If you have a giant sign outside your business advertising lunch special, don't wait until you give a guy the bill that the specials are only for dine-in customers.  This policy doesn't make any sense any way.  Its not like there was a lot more food here.   We didn't  need any attention from the staff beyond taking the to go order  . But policy is policy, OK.

BTW i had used a card just the day before. I mentioned that and the waitress proceeded to call me a liar, claiming they have a strict cash only policy (seriously what century is this?), threatening to overcharge my card, threatening to pull out security camera footage just to see whether I really used my card the day before, asking me to leave my stuff and go to a nearby ATM and finally, after i lost my patience, accepting payment by card, which didn't seem to inconvenience them much. \n\nOh and the food went from decent to horrible too. And did I mention that the waitress was standoffish while i was ordering the food as well and only reluctantly argued to cater to my specifications after lecturing me about indian food. And I am Indian, born and raised!!\nextremely extremely poor service!

Very rude over the phone. I found them on Google maps and looked through their menu there (which had no prices!), didn't see wether they would do a delivery anywhere so decided to call. A woman answered and upon being asked if they deliver, she answered something rapidly and incoherently about their hours of operation, so thing about them not being open yet, I guess. That didn't make any sense as I was calling at 4pm on a Saturday... I asked again if they delivered and I heard one sharp short No!\nI thanked and got off the phone to continue looking for an Indian spot on Uber Eats and Seamless... I found that restaurant on both and YES! They do deliver. \nI will never attempt to order from them again and I suggest you don't either.

However, the last time I was there I asked for Vindaloo and was given a bad rendition of Tikka instead. When I walked all the way back (sick and in the heat) after being told it would be replaced, the waitress/owner insisted it was Vindaloo. Having lived in India for 18 years, I knew the difference. I also knew I had been scammed. It was a waste of 20 dollars and I will never eat there again. They have gained one serving of Vindaloo and lost a regular customer. \n\nPS: There are tons of Indian restaurants in the area. I suggest you visit those for a much better experience. \n\nPPS: The two men who serve are very kind and helpful.

Love the decor. Service leaves a little bit to be desired. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala and ordered shrimp Tikka Masala which was not on the menu, but they were willing to make it.

My wife ordered the tikka masala, and I got a similar tasting appetizer for myself. We both had a side of garlic naan bread as well. All of it was great! The chicken was flavorful, and the naan bread was an awesome complement.\n\nCons:\n\nEverything about the waiting staff and the service they provided was terrible. We arrived half an hour before they were closing for a short break, and ordered knowing they had food 50% off for lunch. We ate our food quickly, mainly because two of the waiting staff were clearly glaring at us from the counter the entire meal (which lasted maybe 15 minutes). Plates were immediately taken if any of us took a break from eating, and the check was forced upon us shortly thereafter. Before we left, my wife asked for a box for the remainder of her food. They provided her with a small box for the entree, but nothing for the appetizer. When she asked for a box for the naan bread, the waitress rudely told her they \"aren't allowed to do that normally, but she would find something.\" This would be almost understandable if the bread was provided at no charge, but that wasn't the case. After quite obviously slamming plates from our table in the kitchen while I was in the bathroom, the same waitress told my wife to wait go wait outside (in the cold) because they were closing soon. She stayed inside. We gave them a fittingly low tip and walked out the door. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 is because admittedly, the food was good. But everything else was a negative experience we won't soon forget.\n\nTL;DR - Rushed service, extremely rude waiting staff.

There was a woman filling up our drinks constantly. She did a better job being attentive.\n\nThe prices of the food were reasonable and the flavor was great. Appetizer we got was chicken Tikka. The chicken was so moist you put a fork in it and it'd break apart. Then we got Behl Per? It was served cold and it had 2 flavors, one that tasted liked a light bbq sauce and another like a cilantro spicy lime sauce mixed with veggies and chutney.\n\nEntree I had a Korma. The texture of the sauce was a light slightly dense buttery melt in your mouth almond sauce and the chicken moist as well.\n\nDon't be fooled by the small bowls. The food is filling!\n\nOnly thing I didn't like was that when they asked us what type of Naan we wanted. I thought it was complimentary since they asked us but they charged $4....\n\nDefinitely an interesting place to check out, however with mediocre service.", "author": "Samantha Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-06", "description": "I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could.\n\nThe space is charming, comfortable, and authentic.
