They are now changing the menu regularly, and the bartender Damon is quite the mixologist - fans of little branch, etc will enjoy drinking here. It's much calmer than Henry St. Ale House, which is nice - I had a delicious hangar steak (though a tad undercooked), and the chicken liver schmeer w/ cranberry compote. Yum! They have excellent steak, chicken, burgers, and many other good dishes, red snapper, lamb loin. I crave the steak though.The service is warm and personable, and the manager once bought us drinks because we sat at the bar and chatted about sports, which we'd all enjoyed.", "author": "Justin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-28", "description": "JTH is really great.

As such we come here frequently and have always had great food, drinks and service. However, I wanted to write as I recently had a very annoying experience. We popped in around 6pm on Memorial Day weekend with the intention of just having a quick drink at the bar. All the bar seats were taken and so I asked if we could sit at one of the other tables explaining we would only be there for 1 drink (there were about 10 free dining tables at this point) I was told no, they were only for dining, so as a last resort I asked if we could just stand at the bar. Again I was told no, there is no room, which quite frankly was ridiculous. The ma\u00eetre de who I was speaking with was new and not the usual girl, I felt she was very rude and unaccommodating, speaking down to us like we weren't good enough for her establishment.

This summer: white gazpacho and a memorable gurwetztraminer for $9.

I sat at the bar, it was a lovely day, I could look out into the street from where I was sitting..appreciating the lovely fall weather. Then I was served the \"behind the knees cocktail\" which was just perfect. I decided on the eggs orleans since I love eggs benedict..I ordered them without the oysters, and asked for a side of the duck confit. Wow, it was indeed the best version of eggs benedict I have ever tasted. I happen to also love artichokes, and this is the first time I had this dish incorporated them in it. .I was in heaven..The hollandaise was excellent and the side order of duck confit was also the best I ever tasted, and rare to find. This place can be described as understated elegance, comfortable but not stuffy, with a gourmet flair. The staff all work together beautifully. Congrats to you all, and the chef, on this delightful experience", "author": "Miriam P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-03", "description": "This place gets busy, but one of our favorite sunday brunches in brooklyn heights.   We get there early to beat the in-evitable rush.  \n\nSome of our favorites:\n\n1) Appetizer - Scones and jam.  An assortment of home-made scones and jams, it's a guilty pleasure.  Scones are flaky, moist . . . you hardly need the jam, which is not overly sweet. \n\n2)  Red Flannel Hash - A combination or brunoise (1/8th inch squares) of potato, corned beef, and beets.  My fiance who loves corned beef hashloves their take, which is actual corned beef instead of spam filler.  I think it's bland, but understand why she likes it. Nice texture contrast in my opinion. \n\n3)  Brioche French Toast - a favorite of ours!  Warm and a bit mushy in the middle, crusty around the edges, strong hints of cinnamon.  The slices are huge, definitely for sharing.  Because it's oversized, they get a nice crust on the circumference, but it's a bit soft in the middle usually. I like the contrast in texture . . . like thomas keller's salmon.  \n\n4)   Shrimp Club Sandwich - It's a triple decker, the standout is the shrimp (cold but cooked perfectly), avocado, paprika, which blends with the mayo, and a BLT.  I usually don't like clubs, don't like shrimp in a sandwich, but I do like this.  The ratio of crunch (bacon, toast) to meat (shrimp) to creamy (avocado, mayo) and umani (paprika) is great.  It's subtle.  I thought it was good, but was surprised I was coming back for it. \n\nOther recommendations:  Eggs orleans (especially if you like oysters and cholesterol. \n\nStay away:  Royal eggs.  It's a subtle dish of baked eggs, goat cheese, pesto and some other stuff.  I do appreciate a perfectly cooked egg,  but  . . .it's mushy, small, and in my humble opinion, nothing really ties the dish together. \n\n*Disclaimer:  this is clearly a place that I like.  It's a neighborhood place,  and there is inconsistency, but overall, a favorite brunch joint.", "author": "Glenn C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-10", "description": "Mac and cheese, and a 'behind the knees'...both delicious, both a must.
