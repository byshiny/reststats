Gracias.\" \n\nThis sentence pretty much exhausts your Spanish (if it's like mine), and luckily it's all you need at Los Papi's. Because the cubano is (1) SERIOUS, and (2) definitely enough. For whatever it is you want it for. Lunch, dinner, feeding a family of four, etc. \n\n1:20 pm: The guy behind the counter carefully selects pernil (think pulled pork, Dominican style; if you don't know, now you know) from the tray, as he (and you) wants a nice mixture of slow roasted meat, unctuous fat, and crispy skin. \n\n1:21 pm: The pork is chopped up and stuffed it into your Cuban bread that's layered with ham, cheese, mustard and pickles. This sandwich then goes on the plancha, which brings it all together, even if it doesn't do much to flatten the thing. \n\n1:27 pm: You are handed your cubano, you snap a photo for your Yelp friends, and contemplate the existential question of whether or not there can be too much pork on a Cuban sandwich. You stop contemplating to rejoice at your first bite. And the second, and all subsequent bites.\n\n1:30 pm: You decide the only thing wrong with the sandwich is that it needs more pickles to cut through the fatty meat. When asked, the counter guy gives you a mountain of pickles. You want to explain that's too many, but your Spanish is poor so you just shut up and eat all the pickles. \n\n1:39 pm: Halfway through, you briefly consider stopping, and realize that's ridiculous. You also spy the huge plates of all the things people are getting as lunch specials, and realize you might have to become a regular here.\n\n1:47 pm: 3/4 of the way through, you seriously regret not having stopped halfway through, but you've gone too far to turn back now. You finish the sandwich, which was definitely ill-advised.\n\n2:25 pm: Unable to keep your eyes open, you nap. There is no hope of resistance.\n\n3:47 pm: You wake up to phone calls and e-mails about the meeting you missed. \n\n3:48 pm: You want to regret the cubano, but it's impossible. Even if you lose your job. \n\n11:47 pm: You go to bed. For the first time in your life, you missed dinner, and didn't even think about it once. \n\nFin.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-24", "description": "I found Los Papi's after Yelping for \"cheap lunch nearby.\" The reviews of the Cuban sandwich were unanimously exceptional, but I had some hesitation due to the location of the restaurant. If you're not familiar with the area, the restaurant is basically sandwiched (no pun intended) between Dumbo and Downtown Brooklyn. If you're walking down Gold Street, be aware that you will encounter a street littered with trash, baby diapers, dog shit, and syringes. Never mind how sketchy this walk can be, I still pursued my quest for the alleged best Cuban sandwich in this neck of the woods. \n\nAfter a somewhat grueling walk through the armpit of Brooklyn, I found myself in a homey diner-like restaurant with warm basins of beef steak, baked chicken, pernil, rice, salad, shrimp, and beans. With so many options that laid upon me, I had to stay focused and order the highly-acclaimed Cuban sandwich. The baked chicken and potato salad also looked really good, so I thought I'd order that too and save it for dinner. And, because I'm a fat ass, I also tried ordering a side of onion rings. But, the guy behind the counter told me that they no longer make onion rings- indefinitely- only french fries. This was a disappointment; despite having onion rings displayed on their menu board. Another thing that bothered me was that they didn't have any of the prices displayed! How do I know how much this is going to cost?\n\nSo, as I was paying for the food, a man tells me the food is $16 for both the Cuban sandwich and the Baked Chicken platter, which I think is a little pricey. So, I give the guy a $20 bill and he gave me back $6. Did I not hear the guy correctly, or did he give me the wrong change? I don't really know because there aren't prices listed anywhere! Oh yeah, they also don't accept credit card, of course. \n\nThe Cuban sandwich was good. I would say more there's a lot more fat in the sandwich- which is probably why everyone is raving about how delicious it tastes. It's not amazing where I'd make that walk again just to eat this sandwich. As for the baked chicken and rice, the chicken was a little dry and the gravy was really oily. I'd probably skip this next time. I would recommend coming here for the Cuban sandwich only if you're already in the area and looking for a quick bite. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth going out of your way for. \n\nDoes anyone actually know how much a Cubano costs?", "author": "James W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-13", "description": "By the eastern fringes of DUMBO, or about 2 blocks from the F train's York Street Station, is an unassuming breakfast and lunch joint that serves up some pretty good American / Spanish food, at inexpensive prices.

As others have mentioned, Los Papi's is also a good pit stop on the way to the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- get there early as the restaurant closes early on Saturdays.\n\nWhat We've Had:\n- Cuban Sandwich ($9): Just wow.

I don't care for pickles but in this sandwich, it is minimal enough to just break up the rich savory taste. I wish the pickle was thinner.
