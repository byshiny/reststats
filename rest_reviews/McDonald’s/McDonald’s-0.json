Soda was flat and no one cares. Bugs flying around. And they tried to charge for ketchup $1.50 at the register. Started at the order here machine and couldn't get past to pay because couldn't find one of those table numbers but my total was $12.60 so went to the register and order same thing and it came to $14.60. I ask the lady behind the register why at the machine it was cheaper, she mumble something and the price went back to $12.60. Look at the receipt and she took off charge for 3 ketchup. Amazing they are ripping people off because lots of people don't look at the receipt and I would not have known if I started straight at the register. How many people have they ripped off and how much have they made? 100 people a day is $150 x 365 = $54,750 a year - nice chunk of change.", "author": "Judy W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-04-08", "description": "Tip 1) if you are at the Apple store across the way getting something repaired wondering where to go - do NOT go here.  Whole foods 365 has restaurants upstairs and hot bar downstairs.  This place is also literally an advertisement for shake shack which is 3 or 4 blocks away.  You have been warned.  \n\nTip 2)  Order at the KIOSKS even if there is a wait - despite having to wait in line again if u are paying cash. Go KIOSK.  \n\nTip 3) your chances of ever coming back will be low anyway - so why bother.  When would this food ever be worth this experience? \n\nThey have people taking orders that don't say anything (staring at me for 3 seconds i had to ask if *they* were ready to take my order.  And you guessed it, she botched the order (did not repeat my order back to me).  Makes sense - put people at the registers who don't like to speak.  Perfectly fine human being, bad management.  \n\nWaited for 20 minutes, did not hear my number, nor was it anywhere on the computer screen which displays orders.  But apparently it had been back there the whole time.  The (assistant manager?) basically gave me some serious hand wave and fast walkaway saying she called my number \"twice\".  I asked for a fresh meal which she finally did provide.  So, I am guilty of going to McDonalds - that is what i felt like just being there.  awesome.  At least they didn't charge me for the side of Sass.  \n\nBTW, ive been plenty of 'super ghetto' mcd's - Central Harlem, Brownsville, Bronx and plenty of other cities.  Nothing was ever this bad as far as the quality of the employees.  This is the worst MCD I've experienced in NYC, although admittedly i would never step foot in one after 7pm FWIW. \n\nIf this were my company id just NUKE this entire effing franchisee.  Its far too small a location (unruly customers plus a cattle auction atmosphere) and too many employees dont want to be there, a manager that clearly cant keep this place together.  Bring in / rotate a team from other locations.  \n\nThis location totally ruins the corporate brand.  \n\nIve never wished for robots as much as i did today.  However catch 22 - im pretty certain an AI bot visiting this location will ponder the need for our existence as a species.

It has got to be one of the worst McDonald's I have ever been to.\n\nHonestly, the workers are pretty good. They are trying their best to deal with the crowds and get people their food. There is table service and computer kiosks for ordering at this McDonald's but unfortunately it does not enhance the McDonald's experience. We waited a really long time for our food and when it was brought to our table it was either wrong or missing some items. The lady apologized and asked us if we were willing to substitute food. Sure, whatever. It was really no big deal.\n\nHowever, it is the crowd I have a problem with. A group of ghetto teenagers (maybe about 15 total) caused a ruckus throwing chairs and cursing while we were there. Imagine this, the elderly, babies, and families in the middle of a brawl. Mall security wouldn't dare stop what was going on or enter McDonald's. Cops wouldn't even show up. What McDonald's did have was a very stern manager and front line employees yelling at the kids to stop it and get out. They really stuck to their guns and I'm thankful to these ladies for doing their best to protect the store and the customers.\n\nBut sorry, never again and I suggest if you like eating in safety, don't come here.", "author": "Rachel A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-02", "description": "Today I dined here with my group of 20 band/choir students. We placed a large order of about $200, so it was important we assured all food items were received. \n\nIn short, the manager on duty was extremely unhelpful and demonstrated a poor level of customer service. It seemed that he just wanted to get rid of me and my students - paying customers - rather than assure that our order was filled correctly. \n\nI suggested that we receive our items, and then step outside to disperse them to my students, and double check the receipt to confirm we received all items - all of this so that our large group would be out of the way in the already busy restaurant.  He continuously told us that if we left the restaurant with our food items that the location would not be liable for any missing items. We then moved to check off the items at the counter, and the manager rushed through this process. When I questioned his certainty on us receiving all of the food, he became snippy and flippant, rather than meeting my concerns with positive customer service. \n\nAnother wonderful employee, BRITTANY, saw the issue and poor process happening and proceeded to disperse our food to the students one-by-one - a much more efficient method that I would have expected the manager to lead. During this we discovered MANY ITEMS WERE MISSING, and she simply called to the crew staff to make sure we got them. All the while, the manager watched over her shoulder, commenting on the missing items as if my students and I intended to steal food that we had already paid $200 for. \n\nThis experience was a nightmare and not at all the level of customer service I expect in retail. I understand that large orders and groups are daunting, but those occasions should be met with HIGHETENED kindness and efficiency, not an attitude or sloppy, inefficient processes. When we left the store, we realized that after all of the above we STILL DID NOT RECEIVE ALL OF THE ITEMS. I was so frustrated with the experience that I did not even bother to return to get them - it honestly was not worth the headache at that point. \n\nPLEASE BEWARE ordering here. The store is always busy, and the leadership does not seem to have a handle on quality customer service approaches.\n\nTHANK YOU BRITTANY for your superior customer service and improvisation in a hectic moment.

The person at the cash register seemed to have the biggest attitude problem while I made my order. It seemed as though I was inconveniencing her by being here.

No one informed us of, or apologized for there being an unnaturally long wait. The staff was overall unprofessional, making jokes and having full blown conversations with each other, with their backs turned to the registers.
