Not greasy.  Get the sweet (dark red) sauce --- it's excellent.

Charcoal broiled chicken,  baby back BBQ ribs, fries-rice-corn-veggies, char-grilled burgers \u0026 sandwiches, wings, salads, wraps, sodas. No beer or wine  (yet).  Nothing fancy, everything is somewhat tasty, simple. About 6 tables to seat, the place looks clean for a hole-in-the-wall it is.  The Smoke Joint 3 blocks away would give you more in quality AND quantity in half baby back ribs than this place in whole rack - for less. But here you can get a quarter back ribs, it is inexpensive, so you pay more for a privilege to pay less))", "author": "vlad d."}], "servesCuisine": "Chicken Wings", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Hot Chix", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "110 Dekalb Ave", "postalCode": "11205", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/kZsCnoazWnJzr3nclJIfmQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17184511122"}
