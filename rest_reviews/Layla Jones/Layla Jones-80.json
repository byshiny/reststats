Not bad, but I would rather go to Sam's or My Little Pizzeria.  Looking for something a bit different I tried them again a few weeks ago, and wow was I impressed with the pizza.  I'm not sure if I caught them on a bad day last time, but I really loved the pizza.  We got the pepperoni, also know as the best pizza topping ever, and I the pepperoni were nicely cooked, the dough firm without being hard, and giving without falling apart, and the sauce had a nice sweetness to it that was balanced by the savory.  The pizza is square and a little different than your neighborhood round pie.  I'm not sure how to articulate it, but it's just different.  Try it.  I've since gotten the pizza two additional times so I know it wasn't a fluke.\n\nI also came in for a meatball press, and it was very good.  It's not a fancy space to dine in and pretty small, but welcoming nevertheless.  They also have pasta on the menu which looked very good when I saw it being plated up for a to go order.", "author": "Russ K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-03", "description": "There are some days in which I can't get enough complex carbohydrates and fatty proteins, that's when I turn to Layla.

I ordered pizza from them once based on their pretty solid review, and I have no bones to pick with the place other than the fact that their pizza isn't any good. It didn't take too long, the people were friendly, the price was good- great even, it was clean...everything was fine except for the food (for lack of a better word) they handed me.\n\nI brought it home and opened the box and had flashbacks to college in a really bad way. The crust was thick, soft, very pale, and tasted sweet, like there was butter and sugar in it or something. There might not be, but it tasted like it. The whole thing was pretty undercooked, so when I picked up one of the square slices everything fell off and I was barely successful at separating it from the rest and picking it up because it was so sloppy. I had to fold it in half so I could hold it with my other hand to keep the bottom from dropping off, and right when I bit into it, it started hemorrhaging orange liquid everywhere. \n\nI hear they have a garden so I'm throwing in an extra star. Plus the people were nice and, in their defense, I did only try one thing...coulda been an off night. \n\nThat was my experience though, had to put it out there.", "author": "Caroline K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-09", "description": "We popped in here for a late lunch. We had a very fresh chopped salad with a very nice dressing.  Then we were served a calzone (huge portion) with amazing beef meatballs and fresh mozzarella cheese. I had the pressed meatball sandwich that had beautiful roasted tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and the bread was spot on! We will be back when in the neighborhood. Service was nice and friendly.

Not greasy, not thin, rather chewy-- usually something I avoid-- but Layla Jones does a very nice job, using fresh cheese that is not soggy, topping the whole thing off with fresh basil.

Pizza here is just \"a'ight\". \n\nWe got delivery tonight- the Fast Eddie pizza (meatballs, pepperoni \u0026 sweet sausage) and a Caesar salad.\n\n8 slices of rectangle 'za with a thin and kinda bland crust. The orange grease factor was high.

They were very accommodating and attentive to our group despite our large size, and the staff was extremely friendly.\n\nThe ambience was great, very casual but still intimate with low lighting and candles. It wouldn't feel weird to bring kids here either.\n\nThe pizza was great -- not a typical NY slice but the dough was nice and the toppings (I had the Fancy Fajita) were great.

Basic. Cheap. Friendly.\n\nWe were looking for a quick bite on a Sunday, and every cafe and brunch kinda place was packed as always, so we fell into this place.  This spot was perfect for a quite bite to start the day.  With great combos, you can't beat the price.\n\n- Mushroom Pizza \u0026 Cheese Pizza:  These squares of pizza have a fluffy crust, so it's not the super thin new yorker kinda pizza.  It was tasty and good.\n- House Salad:  Salad was fresh and a ton of it. It seemed like it was not from a bag, and overall, a nice looking basic salad\n- Rigatoni: The rigatoni was cooked well and had a good marinara sauce\n- Panini with Prosciutto: A big ole panini that was served up well and just a good comfort panini.\n\nThe food isn't like crazy impressive, but its above average.  For a quick bite with a staff that is nice and attentive, I would definitely make this a rotation of regular spots to visit.", "author": "Natalie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-30", "description": "There pizza was good and I was happy with their salad.

The pizza on display was in square, cookie-thick pans with various veggie offerings, simple cheese \u0026 tomato, or pepperoni (though you could request other meats).  \n\nThe vibe/d\u00e9cor has a bit more character than many bare bones joints... more like someone's home kitchen, with magazines to read and the radio playing sing along rock.  \n\nIs it journey-worthy, pizza mecca type place?  Are they experimenting with radical new flavor combinations?  Not really.  But that's fine.   Sometimes you're simply hungry and want a decent bite.

The menu looked appetizing and the prices were right up our alley. As soon as I walked in I was hit with the most incredible smells of garlic, yeasty dough and simmering sauce. Although the inside may be small, the garden area is perfect for a summer- fall inner city escape date night or relaxed night out.  My sister and I love to order two items and split which is what we did with the meatball parm calzone and chicken press sandwich. The meatball parm calzone was on pesto focaccia bread which was fluffy yet crispy and stuffed with delicious meatballs, slightly crisped cheese and sauce. It was all you could ever want. The panini had a great bite from the peppery arugula as well as the sharp goat cheese which was the perfect contrast to the calzone. I will be back again and I can't wait to try the pizza!
