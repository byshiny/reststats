If you want a sprinkle of cheese on it, it's an additional $2.00. So for the price of another beef patty or an actual slice of pizza ($2.25), you can be the idiot and get cheese on your beef patty. \n- I should've dealt with the lunch line at Golden Krust", "author": "Hooney H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-14", "description": "I've passed by Metro Star Cafe a numerous amount of times since I go to school and work around the neighborhood. One day, I had no clue about where to go for lunch so I decided to try out Metro Star Cafe.\n\nThe interior looks very old and run-down. There's an upstairs, main floor (entrance/pizzeria section) and bottom floor (not sure what they do). The hot foods didn't look very appealing to me so I decided to order lunch from the pizzeria section. \n\nI ordered the chicken roll for lunch which wasn't actually very tasty. Mediocre is the word that better describes it. There wasn't enough chicken and it seems there was more cheese than the chicken and half of my roll was slightly burnt.\n\nI don't think I would be returning here for food for a while since the quality of the restaurant and food didn't seem to impress me one bit.", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-28", "description": "Metro Star is a solid spot for an affordable, sit-down lunch in the area. Especially if you have a big group of people who all want different things; there is an enormous variety available, and it's all pretty decent. And they actually have a deceptively large amount of seating, with two levels in the back. \n\nIf you want pizza, the counter is right in front. There are pepperoni and sausage and chicken and all kinds of slices ready to go. Nothing is going to blow your mind, but it'll hit the spot.\n\nIf you want hot food, walk up the stairs in the back. They've got a nice buffet of a lot of Italian options, parms and pizzaiolos and marsalas and loins and such. There are sides like mashed potatoes and some veggies that don't look as green as I might like, but you can get a hearty plate of food for a decent price.\n\nIf you want a sandwich, they can make you one. It will be fresh-sliced and made to order, and the deli guys assemble it with surprising care. However, if all you want is a sandwich and you're not looking for a place to sit, I'd go somewhere else. \n\nThere are cheaper options nearby* that won't charge you an extra $.50 if you want your sandwich to go. Also, the sandwich counter is also the hot food counter and it moves pretty slow. You might end up waiting behind a woman who insists her tuna salad is made in front of her eyes, and then you'll miss a conference call and get fired and then you won't even be able to afford your next sandwich. \n\nYou should really have saved better.\n___________\n\n*Hero Shop, or Side Street Deli.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-10", "description": "Best lasagna....and the pizza its delicious.....

My co-workers and I nicknamed this place \"the lasagna as big as your head place.\"  Cause it literally is.  Huge portions for a decent price.

My coworkers and I ordered 7 pies and paid approx $150 and they were terrible most of the pizza was not eaten because it was so bad.  There was almost no sauce on them and for the toppings they charge over $20 a pie there was hardly any pepperoni on the pizza and on the Hawaiian the pineapple was definitely canned and \n disgustingly dry.  I called to let the manager know and he offered me two free margherita pies for my dissatisfaction and I said ok.  When I ordered the pies a few days later he told me he's only giving me one pie and will charge for the second, completely going back on his word.

If you walk inside and go up to their second floor there is a diner complete with short order cooks that make your breakfast when you order it. For $6 I got 2 slices of french toast, 3 pieces of sausage, 2 eggs, a coffee and an orange juice. My bf ordered a different meal with bacon, toast, home fries, 2 eggs, coffee and orange juice for $4.50. Two complete hearty breakfasts for a little over $10! No frills, great breakfast deals and right by the subway - this place is great! I'm glad I decided to drop by and give this place a chance because I'll definitely be back.\n\nFYI: $10 minimum for credit cards and (random fact) this place is a cop hangout", "author": "Vanessa T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-14", "description": "I lived out of the Marriott for two weeks during a business trip last year.

Cashier is very nice.  You can watch your food being prepared. Nothing fancy. My only gripe is they charge extra for wheat toast and if your having the order to go. I think that being given the option of wheat bread vs white bread should be standard not .50 extra, or deciding to eat in or out is a personal preference. Not everyone has the time to sit and eat, maybe it's a grab and dash day. I shouldn't have to pay .50 extra to take my food with me.
