My boyfriend and I came here on a rainy day looking for warm comfort food. We ordered two orders of the regular XLB, mapo tofu with rice and the N1 beef noodles. I also bought a ginger ale blood orange x Meyer lemon. I thoroughly enjoyed every single dish but my absolute favorite were the XLB. Ever since I learned how to take the subway on my own I would take the train to chinatown and eat XLB there, however after trying Yaso's I'm definitely hooked onto this place! My first bite into the soup dumpling released piping hot soup that was perfectly flavored, and abundant. Another thing to note is their custom vinegar, which wasn't as sour as other places but I love it because the workers made me ginger slices and I made my own vinegar ginger sauce! Finally, the mapo tofu can be improved with more mapo tofu sauce and the beef noodles was a tad expensive ($12.58). Overall, I will come back because the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, had plenty of seating, and workers were friendly (and bilingual!).", "author": "Michelle S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-01", "description": "Best Shanghainese food in town.\n\nSoup dumplings - aka xiaolongbao is the signature dish, freshly made behind glass window you can see how they are made from scratch, Juicy and tasty.\n\nAs for the ambiance, its both traditional and trendy - a mixture of old Shanghai posters in the 30s and Sia singing chandelier. Their spicy soup dumplings are also a novelty.\n\nWill go there again and try other stuff, like sweet and sour pork ribs.

My friends and I were in Carroll Gardens and found ourselves really hungry, luckily I had bookmarked it when she had told me about it! The place is a medium sized restaurant, lots of places to sit. They have pictures on the wall as their menu. I ordered the soup dumplings (4 for $4.95), cold sesame noodles and beef noodle soup. My friend was right the soup dumplings are good. The broth tastes clean and has a tasty flavor. The cold sesame noodles were okay, the noodles were a little too hard \u0026 lacking in flavor. The beef noodle soup was surprisingly good especially since I was least excited about that one. The prices are pretty cheap.", "author": "Frances M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-16", "description": "Excellent solid reliable soup dumplings and assorted hip shanghai street eats.", "author": "Philly S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-02", "description": "It's really exciting to find a place to eat my hometown 's food.

Today, I want to praise how good the pork soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) are at Yaso Tangbao.  I only ordered the Xiao Long Bao and a spicy diced pork noodle soup.  Had the noodle first and thought nothing special about it, so I was thinking the dumplings are going to be so so too.  But the dumplings turned out to be amazing.  The outside breading was very thin which is usually difficult to prepare, but it was strong enough to be picked up by the chopsticks.  The minced pork inside was very tasty and cannot believe the ample amount of pork soup inside the dumplings.  \n\nI am surprised to find such high quality Xiao Long Bao in Brooklyn.  I only knew there was a famous one in Flushing back in the old days. Yaso's Xiao Long Bao is comparable to or even exceed the quality of Din Tai Fung.", "author": "Anton D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-07", "description": "The soup dumpling is probably the best thing I ever had in my life.

I detest American Chinese food but love authentic Shanghainese cuisine so I was super happy to experience the genuine quality and dishes at Yaso Tangbao. \nThe co-owners are so eager to make guests comfortable, the ambiance is fun (you can see the dumplings being made) and pleasantly elegant given the casual nature of street food. \nWe tried nearly everything on the menu, it felt like! \nAll of the dumplings are the perfect texture, the flavor is fresh and refined, the soup rich in flavor but light in overall consistency. I preferred the vegetarian and crab dumplings most. The lion's head was totally a surprise. I don't eat a ton of meat so I was apprehensive about trying this giant meatball but I could have lived on these, they are super flavorful and the consistency is smooth and transcendent. \nI love Yaso Tangbao and cannot wait to go back!!", "author": "Kmd D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-07", "description": "Great veggie dumplings! I do like the thicker skin so that was great for me. Very disappointed with the crispy veggie noodles. The broth tasted like a seafood-esque broth..very fishy tasting. I was expecting something more neutral seeing as the dish was vegetarian. That was a waste in my opinion. Will have to come back to try the cold dishes.", "author": "Divya S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-18", "description": "I have lived/worked in Brooklyn forever. I always stay in Downtown Brooklyn when I come to visit. This delicious dumpling and noodle joint is only a stone's throw from my hotel and I only discovered it tonight. A good soup dumpling is hard to find and this place has nailed it. Highly recommend the blue crab/pork soup dumpling. So savory and the perfect chewy texture that makes getting to the meaty center that much more satisfying. Self serve counter. Friendly and efficient staff. Communal benches for seating.

I'd eat these things all the time. The meatballs are the Shanghainese Lion's Head Meatballs that you can have in a restaurant, but they serve it in noodle soup or over rice. They are moist, full of umami, and delicious.\n\nGreat addition to the neighborhood for fast casual Shanghainese food.", "author": "Charles L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-02", "description": "Expensive but solid chinese fried buns and sticky ribs.

I had the N5 spicy pork noodle soup and my boyfriend had the N4 chicken noodle. Both came out piping hot in minutes. We loved them both with preference going to the pork noodle. A word to the wise the spicy pork soup is delicious but very much Asian spicy not American \"spicy\".
