I'm new to this whole NY pizza business so I went in with open taste buds.  Outside of the place looks pretty grimy but inside is a little less grimier, but still grimy nonetheless.  After ordering a small sausage pizza for 2 people, I did sneak over to the bathroom line to watch them make the pizza.  I loved watching them make the pizza, completely worth the bathroom in line experience.\n\nFor freshly made pizza, the pizza came out pretty quickly, within 15 minutes I would say.  The Good: sausage was good, stringly strands of mozzarella when the pizza was hot, and can't think of anything else.  The Bad: burnt crust, lack of flavor in tomato sauce, and because the pizza was thin it cooled in 5 minutes and the rest of the 20 minute experience of eating continued to get worse and worse.  Unfortunately the last slice tasted like pizza from the morning after, rubbery cheese with the stiff crust.\n\nThankfully there was no wait for me (I went on a weekday, late afternoon).  So again, confused with all the raved reviews.", "author": "Chris C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-07-30", "description": "Overrated!! Don't believe the hype. This place is abysmal! Long lines out front in the hot sun. Don't you dare venture inside to ask a question or check the menu. The waitress/manager will bark at you and shoo you away. They obviously don't value their customers. If you want stale, greasy pizza on a paper plate with plastic utensils and \"soup Nazi\" service then the legendary Grimaldi's is for you. However, if you're looking for REAL New York pizza and a delightful ambiance, I suggest Ignazio's around the corner.", "author": "Jaime I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-03", "description": "Heard about this place from almost everyone I have met in Brooklyn. The pizza was incredible. Light brick oven pizza, but the medley of different tastes were delicious. The sausage pizza was incredible and the mozzarella cheese on top made it even better. Definitely authentic brooklyn-style pizza. \n\nOnly negative part of Grimaldi's was the service. Only got water once during our meal and it took forever to get the check. It was busy, but still, water is vital with hot pizza and spices. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and I will definitely go back.", "author": "Alex G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-04-27", "description": "The pizza itself was okay. It's NYC style in the truest sense which is not my favorite,but when in Rome...  what makes this a 1 star is the rude white bald guy. Not sure of his name. He didn't talk much and neither did I. Cash only so I paid and I had only glanced at the bill. I thought it 15, but with tax it was clearly 16.50 I hadn't seen that so when my change didn't match I asked about it.  He quickly runs off to find the check and rectify the situation. He comes back pissed and using profanity saying it was 16.50 and I got the right change, thrusting the bill in front of me. I'm turned off by his demeanor,but I recognize the mistake.  He then insults my appearance and curses some more.

If you're gong to Brooklyn, you must walk across the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan and if you're going to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, you MUST stop at Grimaldi's for some pizza. \n\nI was visiting from California and my friend that was playing Brooklyn tour guide (she lives in Brooklyn) told us that we HAD to try Grimaldi's. Her eyes lit up when she talked about the last pizza she had there.\n\nWe waited in line for about 30-45 minutes. As each minute passed, our anticipation just grew and grew. Finally it was our turn. We ordered the regular pizza that comes with mozzarella, tomato, basil and we asked for extra garlic. We also ordered one with pepperoni. The garlic was brilliant on the pizza. The crust was great. Not too crispy and pretentious but just the right amount of thin and bubbly. It's what you wish heaven was, and then you realize heaven is in your mouth.\n\nAfter we finished, we started making our way to the start of the bridge. We looked back to find that the line for pizza had almost doubled since we had started our meal. \n\nIt's definitely worth the wait!", "author": "Daisy S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-29", "description": "When I'm in lower Manhattan, I make my trek across the Brooklyn Bridge for the best pizza in NYC...and that's saying something. The line is legendary but if you know when to go, it's sufferable (and no, I won't tell you when to go).\n\nThe crust is the perfect blend of crispy, chewy, doughy and smoky--all thanks to the marriage between the delicious dough and the coal fired brick oven. The sauce is so divine, I'd drink cups of it. \n\nJust an FYI: There is only one line for take out and sit down and they only take cash.", "author": "Diva D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-18", "description": "There's a reason there's a line around the block for this amazing pizza, IT'S THE BEST IN NYC!! AND that's saying a lot. I've had a slice at a lot places in NYC and there is a bunch of great places but Grimaldi's is the place you sit down and order a whole pizza and in my opinion the traditional Margarita pizza is the best I've ever had and I've had lots.

After looking at all the fresh ingredients and watching the men prepare those pies in that large brick oven, the anticipation for amazing pizza was mounting.  \n\nI ordered a small pie with pepperoni and mushrooms....and was sadly disappointed.  The cheese was not melted enough, the pizza lacked enough sauce, and the tiny pepperonis were slightly burnt....I just don't get it people.  I've had better pizza at a random sub shop for $1.  \n\nThere was two great things about my experience at Grimaldi's:\n\n1.  We came on a random weekday and did not have to wait at all-thank goodness!\n2.  The Ice Cream Factory was close by and I had the best butter pecan ice cream ever!

We had read and heard about Grimaldi's and thought we would give it a try despite many bad reviews regarding the service.  Gotta try \"the best!\"\n\nWent on a Tuesday for lunch.  Arrived around noon and waited about 30 minutes to get in, which seems to be a short wait.  It wasn't too cold outside so it was bearable.\n\nWe got in and ordered a large margherita pie and a small pie with sausage and pepperoni.  The pizzas were excellent.  The crust was great, and was perfectly chewy and crispy.\n\nThe service was just ok.  The waiter came to see if we were done, but we hadn't gotten our 2nd pie yet.  It came out just minutes later.  You don't come here for the stellar service though.\n\nA note about the line - If you have a party of 3 and a table for 6 opens up first, it's likely that they will get seated first, even if they are behind you.  It defeats the purpose of having just one line.  Expected, but just a heads up.  We had a party of 3 and about 8 groups of parties of 2 or 4 were let in before us.\n \nThe pizza was definitely wonderful, but I wouldn't go back to Brooklyn just for this, unless I was in the area and there was no line.  As far as my taste buds are concerned, they couldn't tell much difference between Grimaldi's and Lombardi's.

Get the margharita, all you need is cheese, basil and sauce. Less is more. But if you must get toppings, be assured everything is fresh and delicious. Its a bit thicker then some of the New York style pizza so its not as crispy. Its a taste thing and I think its great. We've never been disappointed. \n\nOnly thing I've never liked is the seating arrangements. Often if you come in with a large group like coworkers out for a lunch, you end up waiting until enough space opens up or you get split up. Very inconsistent so sometimes its short and sometimes its long.

I used to wait in line in the winter cold at the DUMBO location to get it, but Patsy Grimaldi sold his restaurant about 4 years ago and now the new owner lost his lease on the original location and moved next door to 1 Front St. In addition, they are expanding throughout the USA - I saw a Grimaldi's in Houston and Tucson.  The pizza is still good and the coal fired oven makes it the one of  the best, but not as good as the original.

We ordered ours for pick up and eat on our road trip home.  We have eyed this place before but the long lines always deterred us away.  Once I got in, the pizza slid right to the cashier as she sliced it and was about to rang me up.  I didn't have any cash on me, so I had to run back to the car.  The pizza was then simply slipped horizontally into a paper bag with a cardboard circle holding it.  They didn't have any paper plates for us to take, but that was okay, pizza was made to be hand held!   The car smelled heavenly while I held it on my lap.  \nThe pizza was really good.  It was nice and thin but still sturdy enough to withhold the toppings.  The crust tasted really good with some saltiness to it.  Everything tasted super fresh.
