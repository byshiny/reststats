It was unacceptably bad service.\n\nThough I did enjoy the part where the owner claimed airing wine makes wine taste worse than a brand new bottle. Haha. Cheap putrid wine would be better if it sat a few minutes, even though it didn't. That was classic misinformation that I got a good laugh from.

I definitely liked the ambiance because it wasn't crazy or loud. It was pretty spacious, clean and had a bit of an intimate feeling to it.\n\nMy fiance got the Cajun Chicken Sandwich (but in a wrap) with fresh mozzarella cheese and apple smoked bacon. That's what he typically gets at Custom House and it's his favorite! Our friend just got the French onion soup which looked amazing and was good for a chilly night that night. I decided to get the Mac-n-Cheese and even though it was an appetizer, it was really filling! The Mac-n-Cheese was cavatappi pasta baked in a three-cheese B\u00e9chamel sauce, topped with golden bread crumbs. It was probably one of the best Mac-n-Cheese I've had! I would definitely order it again.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable and laid back pub to grab lunch or dinner in. It's opened until 4AM so you can even come here for a late snack or grub.

They charge for seltzer water, even when ordering other stuff (on multiple occasions). They play the same playlist everytime I go in. The food isn't anything to write home about. I held off from writing a review, but the last time I went in, I wanted to watch my alma maters's basketball game and only ordered a coke. The bartender put on the game but when I said I didn't want food he threatened to turn off the game since \"no one was joining me\" and \"I only ordered a coke\".

We popped in here for about an hour to meet up with some friends visiting from the U.K. before heading over to Lantern for dinner.\n\nWhat I can write is Custom House is on the cool and very vibrant Montague Street in Brooklyn Heights. The pleace is pretty spacious inside and comfortable. It did get a little loud as more people filled in the bar area. Our waitress was great and checked up on us frequently. Custom House has a decent selection of beer on tap and in bottles. We didn't order any food but the food we saw coming out from the kitchen looked good. \n\nCustom house is a good choice for a beer or two or three and I would go back if in the area again. Like Emily P. I was a tad disappointed we could not find any one to clear our shipment of widgets while we were enjoying our rounds.", "author": "Richard R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-12-15", "description": "(It seems the same bald Irish bartender tried his best to ruin another lovely evening. And I also think he's a total homophobe.)\n\nTOTAL DISCRIMINATION. If you are gay or queer or in any way progressive, AVOID THIS BAR. I cannot believe this happened to us in Brooklyn. In NYC. In 2017.  My dear friend and I were hanging out tonight on the sofa, catching up, next to the Christmas tree, enjoying the fireplace. We'd ordered two rounds of drinks, spaced out by two hours--which is normal, a round per hour. Eventually we were sitting closer and I was leaning against her, her arms wrapped around me--- on a big sofa, in front of a fireplace at midnight on a Friday night. She had just closed out the tab. The bartender, not our waiter who had been serving us all night long, came up to us 5 minutes later and rudely and abruptly said: \"are you ordering anything else? because if you're not, you need to leave. Other people want this sofa. So order or leave.\" \n\nThere was no one around us. No one hovering over the sofa-- the bar was not close to being full. No one was looking at us or waiting on us. The bartender was clearly uncomfortable with us, two women, showing affection in his bar. We weren't kissing, not touching in any type of sexual way. Fully clothed, fully appropriate. \n\nWe are shocked.  We pack up our things. I walk over to the bartender and say, \"who? Who is asking to sit on the sofa?\" He replies: \"That's none of your business.\" \"There is no one waiting on the sofa, \" I say. \"We've been here for two hours and have ordered two rounds. You are pushing us out because we are two women showing affection. If we were a heterosexual couple, you wouldn't have noticed us.\" \n\n\"It's time you leave,\" he says. \n\nI should have caused a scene. I was too shocked. I felt disrespected and humiliated. I should have raised my voice so that everyone could hear what he had done. Instead I'm writing this review, calling his manager and  complaining to the BBB. This is the Trump era, the patriarchy fully activated. \n\nDo not support this establishment.", "author": "Julie F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-06", "description": "I love going to Custom House.
