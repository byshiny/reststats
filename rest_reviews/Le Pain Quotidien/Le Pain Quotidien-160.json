However, when I went there for breakfast this morning the service was great as was the food.  The ham with different mustards is also served with tiny pickles, radishes, cucumbers and some olives.  The soft boiled egg was served with enough bread to let you dip it in the egg and have some left over so that you can put some chocolate spread on it as a small little sweet bite after your meal.  The bread is to die for.  I think the posters before me need to take into consideration that the place just opened hence the reason their service might night have been 100% on point - the whole staff is basically new and they are working on the kinks.  I will be back!", "author": "Nicole F."}], "servesCuisine": "Breakfast \u0026 Brunch", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Le Pain Quotidien", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "121 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Eu7F8tUmJesLkaP2lH2zCQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188583078"}
