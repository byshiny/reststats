I was in the mood for Persian so walked the two blocks from the courthouse to try it out. \n\nMy gut told me this would be a good move and it was NOT disappointed. The beef kebab was one of the best I've ever had. Juicy and tasty. \n\nThe place was empty miraculously and service was friendly and fast. \n\nIf you are at the court house I highly recommend you check this place out during recess. It took maybe 30 minutes from door to check so it works during the hour recess.", "author": "Jeremy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-01-21", "description": "First off, thank you for being open until 11PM on a Sunday  it was so late by the time I got around to getting dinner and I a lot of places were already closed.\n\nI ordered the chicken breast kebab and my sister had salmon. I requested basmati rice and my sister had dill rice with her food. Both were just okay. It wasn't bad but it didn't wow me either. \n\nFood came with pita bread as well. \n\nAlthough there was a delivery option, I chose carry out. I arrived around 10:50 and the guy just kept repeated that the restaurant is closed. Well duh. But I'm here to get my food I ordered 30 minutes ago. You know, the bag that's on the counter. \n\nThe lady who rang me up was going through some personal issues at the time. I believe she just learned a family member of hers passed away. She was hysterical which is understandable but as an unknowing customer, quite frightening. She was crying and screaming throughout the time I was in the restaurant and I was about to just walk out sans food. \n\nInteresting experience overall.", "author": "Bell A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-22", "description": "It was a while since I had such great Kubideh!!! \nAlso ordered kashk bademjun (Eggplant dip) which I fell in love with right away. \n\nThe Baklava came in a large portion with pistachio ice cream on top. The tea we ordered came in extra large size for each person. I would have preferred the tea in a beautiful pot, brought in a tray together with Turkish glasses. \nThe tapperia is very cozy and the sofas make you feel like  you are home.\nThey did not have a license for hookah inside and of course it was super cold outside -with no heaters... so I guess we will have to wait for Spring or Summer for that  DARBAND nostalgia.", "author": "Bahar P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-05-28", "description": "I was sadly disappointed by my lunch here today. I have been craving some Persian kebabs for a few days now. I was seeking juicy beef, chicken, and ground beef kebabs, the way they make them in West la, little Persia. I realized recently that I haven't really had good Persian kebabs in ny so i searched high and low on yelp to satisfy this craving. \n\nI contemplated what to order and settled on the filet mignonette kebab and ground beef and lamb kebab w basmati rice. Prior to the food coming out, I small plate of pita (4 small slices) and cucumber dip came out. That was nice. When my food came, the kebabs were over done and not juicy at all. The filet mignon was more like a skirt steak, not chunks of meat but was one flat piece. I was surprised how dry the meat was, even the tomato was small and dry. The rice was ok but nothing super special abt it.\n\nI only ate half my plate bc it wasn't very delicious. I asked for some rice to go and was charged $5 for it, even tho on the menu, rice is $3. Not sure what is going on at this place but overall, I was very disappointed. For my lunch of two kebabs and rice, and some extra rice to go (I didn't even order a drink) I paid $39. Ridiculous! \n\nI wish I had chosen another restaurant on yelp. Have not been disappointed in a meal this much in so long.", "author": "Yuki M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2019-05-19", "description": "The food we got wasn't bad. But the experience wasn't great. Ordered a beer, which arrived warm. Got a replacement in a chilled glass, but the beer was still warm.  We ordered two appetizers, and asked for some extra bread which took a long time to arrive. Two of our three entrees were OK, the third was incorrect, and by the time the correct order was ready we had to go so just took it in doggie bag.\n\nThe place only had 5 or 6 other tables occupied so it was odd they screwed up so badly. And when the check came, we only got a credit for the first warm beer.", "author": "Roberta S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-12", "description": "Wonderful Persian food.

The walnut and pomegranate stew was delicious, slightly sweet and surprisingly not cloying, which we were afraid of...it was perfect.

Nima is such a lovely person, he sat on the table next to us and we had a nice chit- chat about his background and how he opened the business! Super approachable and friendly. I would have given this 5 stars only if the food was slightly less salty/ greasy! However it's very delicious and I would definitely come back!

Empty at 1pm on a Thursday, warmed up canned spinach and kidney beans and low quality lamb stew meat not braised properly. Tried to give me a lesson in Persian food. Not my first time, Sir. Two men fighting loudly in the kitchen. \nStars adjusted down from 4.\n\nFirst visit:\nThe food was very good, not the most amazing ever, but solid and very tasty! The service was a little strange at lunchtime. It consisted of one man who had only three tables, who gave very uneven service. The solo customer who spoke the same language as the waiter got excellent, swift service and many visits. The other two tables of us waited far longer although the man was very nice. There was a certain cute but also maybe presumptuous attitude. \"Is this your first time eating Persian food?!,\" he asked us excitedly. No. No, it wasn't. Good service could make this a favorite for us, but somehow we didn't quite get there.
