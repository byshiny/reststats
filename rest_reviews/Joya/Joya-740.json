We shared the Calamari, 2 Pad Thais, and Green Curry,  Everything was amazing.  The service was decent, and the prices were pretty good.\n\nFast forward a month and we went again.  The Pad Thai was really off.  Couldn't quite place it, but it was way too salty and didn't taste like the first time.  We asked if there was a new chef in the back or what, but apparently everything was normal.  The calamari was under-seasoned this time too, but the curry was still good.  Will come back a 3rd time to see what is the true story but was really disappointed the 2nd time we went back...", "author": "Simon C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-23", "description": "In NYC there are simply, ALOT of Thai spots to choose from.  Here however, they have something that a lot of them, especially the big names don't have.....GOOD FOOD.  I been coming here since 2012 and still rate them one of the best.  The noodles, dumplings, rolls, curry you name it is delicious.  Best thing is that you will not wait 40 hours to eat.  One thing, I came here on a Friday after work.....2 and half hour wait...and it was raining hard that night.  So, keep in mind if you looking for a date night on a date night (Friday and Saturday nights).  Oh they also do take out if you wanna just eat and run too.", "author": "Chis C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-28", "description": "The food at this place is amazing! Its very cute and cozy PERFECT for dates. In the summer there is outside seating in the back which is pretty nice as well. The FOOD is made in an exposed kitchen so you can see your food being made from where you sit. At night the trendy little bar at the entrance of the bar is buzzing!\n\nThe MANGO salad is scrumptious! It has an awesome mix of two types of lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, peanuts, cilantro, fresh sliced mango with a little tang! Topped with a lemony dressing that is refreshing and the entire salad EXPLODES with flavor in your mouth.  \n\nThe pad thai is amazing with chicken, the noodles are cooked to perfection with fresh bean sprouts its one of the most popular dishes! Soy substitute for you vegetarians out there! Also if you want something spicy try the spicy basil flat noodles!\n\nThe 5 stars I'm giving this place isn't for fine dining, because its not. The 5 stars is for the cozyness of this restaurant and the food at an affordable price! The perfect place for a intimate dinner and drinks at the bar after", "author": "R K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-22", "description": "Ate here for dinner with my husband.  Arrived at 7:40, had a 20 minute wait.  \n\nService was okay.  Nothing outstanding, but not horrible either.  Food was good, but not great.  Ordered Rad Nah; which is basically starch soup gravy over flat rice noodle.  Also also ordered Nauh Pad Kra Praow; which is beef basil.  \n\nBoth dishes had beef and had the beef been more tender it would have taste really good.  After a few bites it started hurting my teeth.  \n\nSo overall, it was okay.  Better than a lot of other Thai places, but I still like Nusara in Queens more.", "author": "Debbie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-28", "description": "this place stay popping and for good reason...the food is great \u0026 so is the service...plus the prices are just right...cant wait until a return visit", "author": "Natasha W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-23", "description": "One of the most famous if not the most famous Thai restaurant in Brooklyn. I definitely like it better than their other spot Song! The apps are all good the service is always fast the Pad Thai is very greasy so I would stay away and the bill is always cheap!

This place is a steal! Great thai food for a great price, with very large portions. It's usually packed, so get there early. They don't take reservations and only deliver to some locations in the area. \n\nAppetizers: Calamari is delicious - has a nice kick to it!\nEntrees: Pad Thai and the Spicy Noodles are delicious and have not been an upset yet!\n\nCash only. But, this place is so good that I get cravings for it.

In the summer it is great to sit in the back. I love the mango salad. All of the noodles are all good. With tofu or chicken... the beef is not good (tough and no flavor). Joya is well priced \nand fast to deliver. It think it is pretty standard fair- clean, fresh and tasty.

It has become a favorite with all my friends. Every time I have out of town visitors, they always want to go to Joya. The food is delicious, awesome prices, big portions and most importantly consistent. The service is fast and efficient. JOYA is the perfect choice for a casual night out with friends or dressy dinner with my boyfriend. We always leave happy.

The price is perfect, although it can get really crowded its always well worth the wait when you get seated. Try the Pad thai or the spicy noodles and can you believe its under Ten bucks.

Definitely a place to meet up with a group of friends to have a quick dinner, and definitely for a younger demographic. The place is loud but you don't have to raise your voice to speak with others at your table. \nCame here mid week for dinner and it was packed. Turn over was quick, waited only a few minutes for a table. \nGot the curry puffs and the ribs as apps. Ribs had an outside reminiscent of sandpaper, would never order again. Puffs were really thick and filling, with a hint of curry. I don't think go well as an app in a Thai place, at least not these, because they are too heavy to be followed with some noodles etc. would get it as take out maybe not a sit down meal. \nFor mains tried the masaman, their \"spicy\" noodles and the pork kraprow. Best was the masaman even though the beef was a bit tough, there was a lot of it. There was nothing spicy about the noodles and they were a bit overlooked and mooshy. Kraprow was ok. Also forgettable really. \nFood was super bland and especially for Thai food. Was really strange they didn't have any hot sauces on the table. I looked around at other tables thinking maybe ours was just missing this, but didn't see any on other tables either. I looked over the reviews for their sister restaurant Song, and noticed they have this there but on request. Maybe it's the same here, I'm not sure. But kind of weird to keep this a secret especially when the food is so bland. \nEither way, it's a decent solid spot to know about for quick dinner with friends.", "author": "Maria B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-02", "description": "I love joya and I still plan on going back but last time I went I when they were opening so it was pretty empty and the food was below their usual. I order the vegetable spring rolls which were great as always since hard to mess up. I divided to also get a large calamari for the table. The calamari at Joya is always tasty and never to salty. This time the calamari was soo chewy and hard like they were using stale oil. They took it back and gave us our entrees which was a little greasy and my rice was stale. I ordered the saut\u00e9ed shrimp with the vegetable medley and the garlic sauce (for anyone who wanted to know). The waitress gave us their usually tasty mussels but when we had it, tasted like it needed to be washed. And it had the butt taste you get with dirty seafood. We left dissatisfied with the overall meal, but I always like the fact with all the problems the bill wasn't crazy.", "author": "Isaiah B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-01", "description": "The food was good and the price was excellent for a sit down restaurant  All of the dishes that my wife and I had were sub $10 with large, generous portions.

Easily one of the top Thai places in the city. The food is always well prepared.  The fried rice is so fluffy.  Huge portions on all almost everything (minus the appetizers of course). Thai is never really expensive for the most part and this place beats most. The amabience has always been relaxing especially in the Summertime outside.

They serve you and forget about you.  However, the food is really good I can't complain.  A small plate of calamari definitely serves at least 2-3 people.  Instead of traditional Italian dipping sauce, they give you a sweet and sour like sauce with what I believe to be chili flakes.  Very, very good.  I also enjoy beef Pad See Yue.  Delicious.  The sauce is smokey and sweet.  Prices are very reasonable.
