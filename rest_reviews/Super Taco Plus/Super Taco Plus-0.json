The food is definitely not authentic at all but honestly who cares, the food serves it's purpose- to keep you from being hungry. The chili taco wasn't appetizing, the meat was mushy and gross but the hard taco shell and salsa provided were pretty good. The chicken taco on a soft tortilla on the other hand was really good. The chicken had enough flavor and spice. For that I give this place 3  stars.

OH NO. This place is my nightmare. I don't know why I even bothered to *try* after I walked in and saw the menu, and the fact that Super Taco Plus is a Chinese \"Tex-Mexican\" joint. Are you bloody kidding me? This is my own fault. I did it to myself. I only get an hour for lunch, and I'd already spent fifteen minutes of it walking around looking for something edible. I usually bring my own lunch, but Friday, I forgot, and subjected myself to Super Taco Plus.\n\nIf you think - nay, KNOW - that real tacos should be made out of home-made, delicate, double CORN tortillas, filled with tender, spiced meats or beans/peppers, and topped with cilantro and onion with a side of radish and cucumber, then steer clear of this disaster. \n\nHere you can purchase soggy, floppy store-bought flour tortilla \"tacos\" smeared in mushy, indecipherable something-something (I ordered black bean tacos), and topped with - horror upon horror - shredded orange (government?) cheese, and some other things I couldn't identify, served at room temperature. My tacos sadly went directly into the trash can after one bite and six wasted dollars. I had a v8 and some Smartfood popcorn for lunch instead and cried a little. \n\nI can't understand how anyone would think this is actually \"food,\" nevermind \"good.\" I say it's neither.\n\nps: Down the street a bit is Fast and Fresh Deli, which seems authentic as it is a Mexican market that sells tacos to go. While it's too far away for me to get there/back on my lunch break to see for myseld, I will happily direct everyone there instead of any of the gross Chinese taco places downtown and wish I myself could go.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/fast-and-fresh-deli-brooklyn#query:tacos", "author": "Elishevah G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-05", "description": "My review is well over due for this restaurant. I have been going here for years at least 7 times in a month. This place is my favorite spot to eat indoors or to take home. I just wish the seating had more table space for comfort. Seating area, tables \u0026 floor is always clean. The food is always fresh here \u0026 tasty. The people are always nice \u0026 friendly \u0026 remember you as a valuable customer. The steak quesadillas are my favorite. Also the chicken \u0026 shrimp Fajitas \u0026 all Taco's 1 hard \u0026 1 soft are tasty. Other foods are very good also. The hot wings, rice \u0026 salad. I originally wrote the wrong review for the restaurant across the street, called the Yummy spot. That review is for this restaurant. I have never eaten at that restaurant \u0026 will not change because I like this place. I also thought it was alot of nerve for another spot to open right across the street from this original place. They have been there for a few years, but I never saw a line or crowd at that restaurant.

See my review on http://www.yelp.com/biz/super-taco-brooklyn.   That said, it is still a Chinese owned Mexican restaurant.\n\nMy girlfriend is a Latina, so Chinese owned Mexican restaurants are like what a ball park frank is to a Bavarian.   But still, I live in Brooklyn Heights, where good restaurants are few and far between.  And we have NO Mexican restaurants, which is one of my favorite cuisines.  I wanted SO badly to order from this place...  I wasn't looking for great; I was just looking for mediocre.  For a taco...  a taco...    But each time, she scared me into not ordering.  She kept talking about tacos that smelled like pork fried lo mein, and pointed to a \"Mexican restaurant\" menu that included items like Chicken Teriyaki (appropriately served with \"Mexican rice\").\n\nBefore we knew for SURE it was a Chinese Mexican place (all we had was a menu), we even called to place an order.  After hearing a Chinese lady answer the phone, we quickly hung up.\n\nLast night, I wore the pants in the family.  I put my foot down and we ordered from Super Taco Plus.  The woman who answered the phone was Chinese.  I placed the order.  She was polite, efficient, and competent.   I was feeling dangerous, so I didn't even ask her to read the order back... I was curious to see if it would come back 100% correct.\n\nIt did.  Big check-plus in my book.  The food was delivered by a Mexican dude.  Very polite and amiable.\n\nI opened the bag and sniffed.  I didn't *think* it smelled like pork fried lo mein, but I wasn't 100% sure.   We started to eat and were ... pleasantly surprised!\n\nIn general, the food is very cheap, and comes in rather small portions.  This is a huge huge plus for me.  You can order a wide variety of items to really sample what the restaurant has to offer without a) going broke, b) feeling like your stomach is going to burst, and c) becoming super fat.   You really can have a single taco or maybe even two if you want a snack before dinner.  They're really that small.  Like \"White Castle, can I take your order?\".  But perhaps more like \"Welcome to Castillo de Blanco.  Nee Ho Ma.  Have you eaten yet?\"\n\nThe food is also non-spicy, and that's ... OK.\n\nThe hard tacos were small.  Not a ton of filling.  But the shells were fresh enough.  The lettuce and tomato were not great produce.  But they were good enough.\n\nThe Mexican rice was nothing spectacular.  There was a meager distribution of olives, and the color was more of a vague light yellowy orange instead of a deep rich orange-red color.  But it was good enough.\n\nThe soft tacos, like the hard, were smallish.  They were flour (not corn) tortillas, which makes sense since corn tortillas are only really pliable when they're warm.\n\nThe quesadillas were a bit of a surprise.   They were smaller in radius (I think they use the same tortillas as the soft tacos) and thicker.  More of a snack.  As everyone knows, a cylindrical volume varies with height as \"z\", but varies with radius as r^2.\n\nI was dreading the guacamole.  I've had disgusting guac before, and was expecting the same.  It was actually pretty good.\n\nThe salsa had a good flavor, but wasn't the least spicy and was very non-descript.  I think the salsa might have been filtered (ok, that was supposed to be funny).  But seriously, it had no chunkiness.  No bits of tomato or cilantro.   It *tasted* like there was tomato and cilantro.  But there were no chunks at all to make an interesting consistency.\n\nAll in all, this is very good food FOR WHAT IT IS.   It's a cheap taquera, in a poor neighborhood, that also serves Teriyaki.  Whaddya want, Chef Sanchez?  If you want really quick, really cheap, very edible Mexican food that well-approximates the word \"good\", then this might be your place.\n\nAnd I'm writing this review the next day.   No GI surprises!\n\nHere's what I've eaten (plus any comments that are merited):\n\nHard Tacos:\n     Tex-Mex Chili.  Somewhat greasy, but it's chili, so big surprise?\n\nSoft Tacos:\n     Shrimp.  I feel guilty saying that I loved this.\n\nQuesadillas:\n     Jack cheese and guacamole.  Surprisingly good.\n\nEnchiladas:\n     Grilled white meat chicken.  I was hoping for chicken chunks, but they're strips.
