For the most part they are consistent. There are times where they may skimp on the food, which is why I avoid when it's very busy. \n\nTheir burritos are some of the best in NYC. I'm sure there are other amazing burrito places, but considering this is a chain restaurant, the food is always fresh. You can't go wrong with Dos Toros. Even their chips are great.\n\nPlus they have free water and hand sanitizer.", "author": "Jonathan M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-02-06", "description": "So I was sooo disappointed by my meal. I didn't feel like walking to chipotle and I've never tried the food from here before, so I took a leap of faith. All I can say was never again. The food tastes like nothing. They say grilled food so I'm expecting to taste charred well seasoned food. Yea no not the case. I got a bowl and the girl was SO STINGY with the rice. She put half a spoon, I was like umm can I get more rice please!?!? I got it with steak, and everything on top and I got guac. When I got to my office and sat down to eat I could cry. The corn is boiled the fajita is saut\u00e9d in oil and the rice wouldn't know what flavor was if it got smacked across the face. I got full because the food was so bland. It wasn't even ok. This place makes chipotle taste like gourmet Mexican food  the steak didn't even have salt on it. I've never had such bad/ bland Mexican in my life. And the owners said this is based off their love of Cali Mexican food? No shade but this ain't it chief. And the guac isn't good.... it's just avocados with salt!?!?!? Also I think it's really sus that only elite yelpers left good reviews, and all the pics on the yelp page are of influencers not people taking pics of their means . Maybe it was a bad day but y'all decide if you wanna go. Ok I'm done ranting\n\n\nUPDATE: I now have food poisoning. After I ate I had a horrible upset stomach and have been stuck in the bathroom ever since", "author": "Efa O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-12-13", "description": "I usually come to this location for lunch with my friends.  \n1. In occasion we came here, 2 people were taking up seats and eating food from subways. I dont understand why the staff didnt tell these ladies to leave as many restaurant owners/staff would. \n\n2. Yesterday 12/12/2018, and it was just an annoying experience. I'm the type of person who usually speaks up specially when theres bullshit given. I ordered a no cheese quesadilla and TWICE I asked the lady to add extra steak id obviously pay for it but she tells me \"its portion control\" as if I give two fucks. My friend said she'd be offended but I had no time to waste. One of my friends got the platter with rice and it had a smell. Like if the rice was expired.  She feels sick today.

Unfortunately, nothing has changed except now they've gotten creative with the distribution of the guacamole \u0026 sour cream. Instead of putting the spoon a quarter inch in, they now dip it in a quarter inch, but tap the spoon down the bowl to make it seem like it's more than it is lol I can't make this stuff up.

When I first started work around the area about 2.5 years ago this was my favorite spot to go to and I would come here to really treat myself. The portions use to be generous and the size of the bowls were a good size. What really makes this place good is the habanero sauce which has a really strong quick and very tasty. I witnessed this place kind of go down hill for multiple reasons. I think they changed the size of the bowl ? Also past couple times I came they really were less than generous on the meat scoops. Also they don't take cash ? I never heard of a establishment that does that lol. I use to rave about this place to all my friend that didn't work in the city but now I feel like it's noting to rave about and is on the same level as chipotle.", "author": "Daniel P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-12", "description": "Immediately as i started ordering i was wondering if it was too late to find the nearest chipotle.. these guys have smaller bowls, less options and just no...

Walking in here and all you see is a line a long line. But the line moves quick and I am at the counter already. I order the bowl add rice and off to the meat selection. The steak looked the best so that's what I went with. Next line over I add lettuce , pico, cheese, guacamole and sour cream. Next station is to pay and asks if I want chips. So of course I get the chips and quac. When I went to pay they said they don't accept cash - what??!!?! It's crazy how many places are cashless these days. \nI grab my food and head back to work, everything is pretty good and on par with chipotle but this place has better quac by far.

I have tried the burritos on two occasions and I personally feel the food lacks seasoning, it's just \"okay\". The service is pretty basic nothing to write home about, the layout is similar to that of chipotle you choose your base, your meat, beans etc.... and there you have it a Burrito, Salad, Taco etc. I can't say I recommend this place but give it a try all of our taste buds are different !", "author": "Andria A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-20", "description": "I like you, Dos Toros. \n\nYou cook tasty Mexican food, and allow me to purchase it at an affordable price. All your meat is 100% naturally raised (it says so on your signs). I'm not sure what the regulations are in order for you to say that, but the fact that you care at least a little bit...that's a step in the right direction. And even if you run out of pork later in the evening, I'm glad you're here on Court for me to stop and stuff my face after a soccer game.\n\nAll that said, I have a specific bone to pick with you, and it's that we have different definitions of quesadillas. \n\nMine are very cheesy affairs that you load up with a bunch of stuff and then press on the grill. Yours are slightly cheesy tortillas that you grill, and THEN load up with a bunch of stuff and fold over. I'm not sure which one of us is right (I'm right, because more cheese is always right), but luckily, both taste good. \n\nSo I'll see you soon.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-14", "description": "Love Mexican food, but these place is not so Mexican, often really salty food and uncooked meat  is what I see when I order the food.

Chipotle will always have a place in my heart but Dos Toros is sooo damn good!!!\n\nI think if you want Americanized Mexican fast food, you get Chipotle which is great! But if you want authentic Mexican fast food, you have to get Dos Toros. The rice is super soft and flavorful, the toppings are all fresh and flavored. The steak here is actually tender and quite juicy. The hot sauce is actually spicy(good thing). Also!!! the guac is only $1 extra!!!
