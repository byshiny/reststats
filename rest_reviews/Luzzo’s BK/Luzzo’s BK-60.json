I'm glad I finally make it out because Luzzo's makes fantastic pizza (I'm sure their pasta is good too). Their wood burning brick oven is in full view unless you're sitting in their back patio, the ambience is nice and a good date night place. My fiance and I split a couple of their personal sized (12\") pizzas. Prices for the 12\" pizzas are shockingly high at mostly $18-21. $7 for a bottle of Peroni (the least expensive of the few beer options) was no bargain either. \n\nWe split a sausage and their signature option which comes with \"tomato sauce, mozzarella, speck, fresh ricotta, truffle pat\u00e9\". Both pizzas had the ideal light and chew to the dough with the proper charring and delicate crust to it. There was no truffles or pate visable on the second pizza but there was a definite truffle oil flavor, there was a bit of brown speckling to the pizza, not sure if this was some sort of pate dust. Regardless the spec and ricotta was excellent. The sauce wasn't as bright and fresh as I like but it wasn't a distraction. Overall we were both very pleased with the pizzas.", "author": "Matt E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "The decor is nice and service was also really good. We ordered mussels for appetizer and a large pizza. The mussels were the largest mussles I've ever seen and a few them tasted very sandy, and one of them I couldn't chew and had to spit out. We ordered the Charlie pizza, which was good \u0026 tasty but a bit too oily and the cheese was a bit too much. The drinks were good, we got a wine and mixed cocktail - but they charged me 2.00 extra for 3 olives, which is ridiculous and I have never experienced that before. Good but won't be coming back.", "author": "priya s."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-26", "description": "Hands down the best pizza in BK Heights, love the thin crust and the ease of ordering.

And every New Yorker loves to talk about their favorite pizza joint. Yes, Di Fara, go there. Yes, Lombardi's, go there. Yes, Grimaldi's, go there. Yes, Paulie Gee, go there. Yes, Roberta's, go there. Yes, Totonno's, go there. Yes, Lucali, go there. Yes, Luzzo's BK, go there. \n\nLuzzo's is among the top pizza places in New York. A good pizza, is well like ecstasy. All the endorphins that are released is equivalent to a really good stretchy bendy yoga class. Sorry, I know, I am hippie like that. \n\nMy date and I came here on a cold weeknight around 9pm. We got a table immediately and they let us sit at a 4-top booth even though there was only 2 of us. Good sales move. \n\nWe opted to get some house wines ($8/glass), be warned they are not DOC or IFT-certified. \n\nWe ordered the arugula, candied walnuts, blue cheese salad for starters. Excellent. It helped to whet the appetite for the main course. We shared a 16 inch fungi pizza. You can get pizzas that are either 12 or 16 inches. Since we were hungry, we got the bigger one. The pizza was perfect. Nice, chewy crust and just plain good. \n\nI recommend stopping by if you are in this neck of the woods. You will not be disappointed. I know we were not and we went out into the cold, belly full, inebriated and immensely satisfied.", "author": "Vivian H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-07", "description": "I owed Luzzo's a review so long ago! The people are awesome, the happy hour drinks with free nibbles of pizza is great. I like people watching the street while having a glass or two of wine.

For a table of six, we ordered two large pizzas, the Tartufata and Arugola, and two pastas, the Carbonara and Vegetable. Much to our surprise, the Vegetable pasta unanimously beat out the Carbonara at a table of bonafide carnivores. Seriously, my friends are cavemen who laugh at veggies or use them decoratively at best. \n\nWe saw at least two infants while party brunching on a Sunday, so beware of your language, boisterousness and behave!

It's got brick walls and high top tables in the front, along with a small but quite well stocked bar.  We came here for lunch on a Sunday, and it was my first time having pizza in Brooklyn. \n\nWe started with a spinach salad to feel less guilty about the pizzas.\n\nPizzas:\n1. Nonna luisa: tuna sounded a bit odd, but it worked well with the pickled peppers, which were the highlight. This is a very interesting pizza\n2. Luzzo's BK: more traditionally what I would order - truffle, proscuitto. The crust was super thin but held up nicely and was perfect for folding\n3. Battilocchio: a more interested oval shaped, thicker crust breakfast pizza topped with two eggs.  This one was very rich but interesting to try at brunch\n\nService was friendly, and I appreciate that they have lots of coat and purse hooks for the high top tables.", "author": "Marilyn T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-06", "description": "Stopped in with a friend who recently moved to the area on a Sunday afternoon for some high quality NYC pizza. The Brooklyn location is smaller than the East Village spot and has a rustic, yet modern feel to it. The front of the restaurant has a little bar and is situated better than the small bar at the Manhattan location. Our fashionable server came by and we decided to order two 16\" pizzas, the Arugula and the Luzzo's BK. Fortunately, she warned us that for two people, the 16\" pizzas would be a lot food and a challenge to finish. We decided to take her advice and down shift to 12\" pies instead. Thank you Martina, we owe you one. \n\nBoth pizzas arrived at the same time and looked amazing. They both had a nice thin crust, not too crisp with just the right about of chewiness. The Arugula was crisp and bright green, with ample amounts of shaved parmigiano on top and the prosciutto with mozzarella underneath was delicious. Think of this pie as a way to get your vegetables in for the day. \n\nThe Luzzo's BK had nice strips of Speck (another type of prosciutto), ricotta, mozzarella and truffle pate. The truffle pate is more like a oil based spread than chilled hunk of pate. The ricotta, combines with the speck and truffle to create a delicious, savory bite. \n\nYou'll notice Luzzo's has placed the letters D.O.P next to some food items on its menu. The DOP in the case of the prosciutto means that the pork was raised within a designated geographical region in Italy and the prosciutto was produced only from a certain provence. I'm not sure where this prosciutto was created but the D.O.P means that the European Union has given it a protected designation of origin. I'll just have to go back and ask next time. \n\nService was good, our waters were constantly filled and our empty dishes/trays were quickly cleared away. i definitely recommend visiting this outpost if you're in this part of town.", "author": "Steve S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-27", "description": "I stopped in for a quick dinner with the kids, first choice was Hibino, but the wait was too long.
