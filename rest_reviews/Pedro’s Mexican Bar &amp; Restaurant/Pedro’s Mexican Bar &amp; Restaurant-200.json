The Cuban sandwich I had was nothing but greasy and unappetizing. Guac and chips were more expensive than chipotle ? Like what? The Guac was only alright. The wings came plain unless you ask for some type of sauce. And lastly, service was really slow. If I want some good Mexican/Spanish food, I'd rather walk one more block and have Los Papis.

But we came in to get out of the weird weather it was raining like mad. \n\nI ordered fish tacos (I know I should probably know better-Fish tacos in New York) \nThey tasted fresh enough but I guess after you have had fish tacos where they are bringing in the fish from the water right next to the restaurant and making your food from that same fish it wasn't the best choice...like on the water in CA, FL and WA. My friend ordered a nacho thing and it was chips glopped on with toppings like chicken, beans cheese etc...\n\nThey do have a small what appears to be a full bar and on a nice day you can sit outside (and which I probably preferred if the weather wasn't so crazy). \n\nWill I be back only to have a drink outside probably not to eat.", "author": "Tick...tick...tock...Clock C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-07-07", "description": "Not only is the place extremely cramped, it took over 40 minutes to get our food.

My friends and I enjoyed a pitcher of margaritas which were delicious, and I had the quesadilla with chirizo which was insanely delicious,  my friends had delicious meals as well.

I ordered the fish tacos thinking it was safe seeing that it's pretty hard to mess that up. I was expecting white fish instead I had what looked like a cross between dried shredded fish that wasn't rehydrated fully and cat food. they where tiny little things that tasted so dry and there was no sauce. Not the Mexican food that comes to mind. I'm sure there other things that are good here I just suggest not having the fish tacos. \nThe chorizo enchiladas on the other hand are really good and are well seasoned. The servers are not attentive you will have to flag then down everytime you need something.\nI suggest this spot for the summer margaritas and Coronas outside during a sunny day not much else.", "author": "Elena F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-25", "description": "I live by YELP, so you can understand why I was reluctant to stop here after reading the reviews.

Tourist trap tourist trap tourist trap.\nThey're lucky their business is smack dab on the most perfectly visible corner of Dumbo or else they would be making nada. \n\nI've been here twice. Once on a fateful day of the Dumbo Arts Festival 2012 packed full of people out of Dumbo (including me). Service was slow as hell. It took over an hour for our food to get to us. Granted it was busy. But how do they only have one waitress working at all times? I felt bad for a couple that was there before us. We got our food before them and they barely got their fried plantains while we were leaving. The food was a memory. So boring and nondescript that I forgot what I even ordered. \n\nMy second time was yesterday actually. I was in Dumbo helping my roommate film her dance rehearsal. She treated me and her dancers to lunch. And can you guess where she took us? Oh yeah, that perfectly visible and obviously situated Mexican restaurant in a corner of Dumbo. I already knew where we were going before she even told us. Ended up muttering under my breath \"not fucking again.\" \n\nWe all ordered something different. I went with the empanadas, craving something familiar from back home in California. I've only had empanadas one other time in NYC and that time I watched in horror as the cook literally took a refrigerated empanada and pop it in the microwave. Well these were three empanadas for $7 and they were fried to oblivion. Tough, thick, greasy dough. Sparingly tasteless fillings. Dough to filling ratio was 100000000000:1. The guava-filled empanada wasn't bad, but could not save me from the 2 gallons of crude oil the other two were drenched in. \n\nThe prices are too expensive for such mediocre, laughable Hispanic food. \nSeriously, where can I find decent Hispanic cuisine in NYC??? (And no, Chipotle does not freaking count.) \n\nI've been to Dumbo twice and this is the only place I've ever eaten at while there.

It looks so cute and comfy! But there were too many things that turned me off to it.\n\nOkay.... for all you restaurants out there... here is a tip.... DO NOT HAVE ONLY ONE WAITRESS SERVING AND ENTIRE RESTAURANT. Really! I mean the place was jammed at only one lady was working. Finally I saw some guy start helping but the poor woman! Things are bound to go wrong when its like that! It took us an hour to get out meals...which were mostly sandwiches. They forgot 2 out of the 5 drinks for our table... and none of them except the ones that were from bottles tasted good. \n\nThe food itself was interesting.... the ingredients were totally fresh.. I enjoyed that part. But the portion sizes were tiny!  Not to mention not authentic.... my friend and I got these mexican sandwiches... the inside stuff was fresh and yummy however was seriously lacking in he amount. We ordered sandwiches called 'tortes'... instead we got italian bread that was obviously put on a paninni press to look like a torte... with 1 slice of advacado and the thinnest piece of chicken I ever had. it was just disappointing....We all left completely unsatisfied. \n\n\nEh this place just did not do it for me.", "author": "Gina Marie B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-31", "description": "Decent drinks but the service leaves a lot to be desired for.
