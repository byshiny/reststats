Came from far to eat here and all we got was what they felt like giving us.  I asked for vegetable fried rice and they give me fried rice with eggs and then the server has the nerve to tell me the vegetables are in the rice.  I also asked for chicken wings well done and I get chicken wings cooked well on the outside and raw on the inside.  I will never come back here again and I suggest no one to go there to eat.  I gave them a one star but it wasn't because they deserve that much it's because I can not continue if I don't rate it.", "author": "Josephine V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-03", "description": "For Brooklyn heights, this place is good.

For an appetizer we had shrimp shumai which was very good. Not too  salty. \nMy main course was the famous Gen. Tso chicken which I throughly enjoyed. The chicken had a slight crispiness to it but was still very tender. In NY it's hard to find an authentic \"sit down\" Chinese  food restaurant. Most Chinese  food rest places here are take- out orders. But at the Fortune house you get that old school  feel. Also,  The waitress we had was very friendly.

Suddenly they want to charge $1.00 extra for any sauce on the side. Already the food has been on the decline and now this? They need to go out of business if they feel they can't keep the family business going - not nickel and dime us to death and cut corners on quality to try to turn a profit.

If you're looking for a great lunch and superb service, look no further. \n\nIt's been a while since I've had their seafood, but they always had really fresh seafood and I always looked forward to the crab that they served. It was cooked with garlic and scallions and was battered and fried perfectly in a soy, ginger sauce. The way the Chinese do crab and lobster are very different than the average American eatery where they just steam it or boil it; so if you've never had it, get out of your comfort zone and try it! \n\nI remember the steamed fish was always great too, the soy sauce with the oil drizzled on top of white race and eating the soft fillets of white fish were always a good treat.\n\nAlways nice to see a legit hole in the wall keeping up good traditions.", "author": "Arthur H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-03", "description": "this is one of,  if not, the only REAL original\nChinese reataurants left.  the food is always on point and it is the original vibe that these restaurants used to have. the servers arent the nicest people but the food is good\nthe wonton and egg rolls are always good and those things are a perfect way to know how a Chinese restaurant is as many in the world today are hit or miss", "author": "John D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-26", "description": "I'm fairly forgiving with inexpensive restaurants, but this place is awful. The squid was spoiled, the broth in the wanton soup was nasty (how do you mess up wonton soup?), and the General Tsao's chicken was over-cooked and weird. \n\nI strongly recommend you skip this place.

Service was prompt but slightly overbearing, asking us three times within 10 minutes if we were ready to order (while semi empty). Luke warm and diluted green tea, few shrimp in my chicken and shrimp entree, and had to pay a $1 extra for sauce (although still very reasonable for the price- well, BK heights prices).

It was better a few years ago and I've noticed it's more of a \"miss\" than a \"hit\" now.   In addition to the inconsistency in flavor, there is an inconsistency in the amount of food. Sometimes you get more chicken...sometimes you need to search among the vegetables...  Because of the convenience - and limited take-out food choices in the area - I sometimes order from them and hope for the best.  Because of their rudeness at the counter, and over the phone -  I won't be taking my chances on a \"hit or miss\" meal anymore.  The woman at the counter has no patience, no manners, and is flat-out insulting...  How this place still exists is beyond me.", "author": "Frankie F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-25", "description": "Much better than I expected!

I've had multiple different dishes here and every time I'm done, I legitimately feel like I ate oil.

The first time i came here i ordered plain lo mein and wasn't 100% happy with it so when i came back i asked the lady if they could put sauce on the noodles and she wouldn't do it for me. Her only reasoning was that it already had flavor, which it didn't.

Just had lunch today and the experience alone will have me telling my co-workers to never return.  I ordered an appetizer which came after I had eaten 1/2 of my entr\u00e9e.  When finished, the waitress asked did I want the appetizer wrapped up and I asked could it be sent back since I no longer wanted it.  She acted as though she didn't understand English and proceeded to wrap it up for me.  When she handed me the bill, my co-worker and I gave her 2 debit cards.  She said the minimum charge was $10 for a card.  Since it was only at $19 bill, we told her to add another $1.  She stood there for a moment confused.  When she finally understood our request, she took the cards and the bill.  When she returned, we each signed our bill and returned them to her.  Already disgusted with our experience, this particular waitress had the audacity to return to the table with my bill and inform me in English (which now she amazingly understands) that the gratuity was not included.  Was she serious?  I should've left her the appetizer I no longer wanted as opposed to the $1 tip she desperately begged for.\n\nNever again..........Now I have to tell all of my co-workers NEVER TO RETURN and trust me, they will miss the business.
