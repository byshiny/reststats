We came here on a night with a clear sky, so we were able to see the entire night skyline of Manhattan. It was beauuuutiful.\n\nWith that said, the food wasn't up to my expectations or its price. I've tried restaurants around the same price range, and the food was prepared much better. \n\nThe appetizers were actually my favorite part of the whole night. I started out with the Scallop Ceviche, and my boyfriend had the Rabbit with Ricotta Dumplings. Mine was very refreshing, and the ricotta dumplings are extremely flavorful. \n\nFor entree, I ordered the Rack of Lamb and my boyfriend got the Maine Lobster. The lamb was good, but not anything amazing - I've had much better lamb before. It could have been a lot more tender. The Maine Lobster was also pretty ordinary... the texture threw both of us off a bit because it was more on the chewy side. \n\nThe dessert was very disappointing. I ordered the famed Chocolate Marquise Brooklyn Bridge, and the boy ordered Caramelized Apple with Almond Tart. The presentation of the Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge was good, but the cake tasted pretty bad. It wasn't rich or moist or anything good chocolate cake should be. The vanilla ice-cream that came on the side was also unmemorable. The Almond Tart was good, but, like I said before about all the other dishes, nothing special.\n\nThe servers were all very attentive, and the restaurant actually added a piece of chocolate with \"Happy Anniversary!\" on both our desserts when we told them it was our anniversary, which was a cute touch. (It wasn't actually our anniversary though - we wanted to get seats by the window so we tried to make our night out extra special. It failed.)\n\nIn the end, I think the price range of this restaurant stems mostly from the location that it sits on. Other than that, it needs to up the quality of the food way more if it wants to be a top top restaurant.", "author": "Christine A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-18", "description": "A stellar place to dine, almost impossible to get in.

The river cafe gets expensive, especially for a party of almost 60 people like ours but it's worth every cent. I loved the food so much that I actually ate the whole steak entree included on the four- course menu, and I just DON'T eat steak or burgers. I figured that once they put it in front of me I'll just try it but I ended up breaking my rule and finishing the amazing and  perfectly cooked angus beef. Our huge party was a great success and I'm looking forward to checking out their regular menu. Maybe I'll bring my boyfriend here on a date. Nothing beats the view of Brooklyn bridge at night and their Brooklyn bridge chocolate cake.. I can't believe I haven't heard of this place before.. I should visit dumbo more  often, apparently there are great places to eat out there in Brooklyn.

Each dish was amazing. First we had gazpacho (compliments of the chef), then we had Scallop Ceviche, the sauteed foie gras, Lobster tails from South Africa, grilled Dorade, and choice of dessert. For the dessert I loved the Brooklyn bridge cake. The food was excellent A+!\n\nThe ambiance was very romantic and we saw a beautiful sunset of Manhattan. The one thing that I did not enjoy was that the service once we sat down was terrible at first. The Maitre'd was great, but our waiter did not bring us a menu for quite some time. We sat there for 7 to 10 minutes looking around because there was no menu. We had to ask for a wine menu and about the six course menu tasting. The waiter did not even pay attention to us for the first 30 minutes we were there. We felt that it was because we were one of the younger couples dining that night. It wasn't until the Maitre'd spoke to the waiter that we had better service.

They also ordered a bottle of our favorite champagne, which was not on the menu, it was chilling in a silver bucket stand next to our table at our arrival.\n\nLast December I hosted a brunch for seven \u0026 my guests were blown away by the superlative cuisine \u0026 the first class florals. I could not have been happier with my selection. The River Cafe has one of the very, very best views of Manhattan across the East River.

They were visiting Brooklyn as a trip down memory lane and this dinner provided a lovely evening in a perfect setting. The place itself is beautiful, and there is a great novelty of dining in a barge looking out on the lights of lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. The dinner itself was one of the best I've had in New York, but the service did have a few issues.\n\nThe food - we began with an amuse bouche of white bean soup with pancetta and some sort of green oil (avocado?) which was rich, creemy and smooth. For appetizers, Grandma had the oysters topped with caviar, which are served on a bed of peppercorns - very cute. Grandpa had the 'fois gras served two ways' (as opposed to the other fois gras offering on the menu) which he really enjoyed. I had the lobster tails with blood orange, which were delicious and beautiful. They were a bit tougher than necessary, but I'll forgive that because we weren't done with our drinks when they first tried to serve us, so I think they held the dishes back a few minutes.\n\nFor entrees, Grandma had the rack of lamb which was great. The mint \u0026 mustard seed jus complemented the meat perfectly. Grandpa and I both got the duck breast in truffle honey which was fabulous! Both the duck breast and the croquette of duck leg and potato were a perfect texture. It also came with some baby carrots which were lovely too. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole dish.\n\nDessert was a bit of a let down for me personally. I ordered the 'sticky toffee ice cream sandwich' which really was a sticky toffee cake and also a small ice cream sandwich.  The ice cream sandwich part was very enjoyable but the cake part was too sweet and had a funny texture. It was too spongy on the inside and a bit tough on the outside, making it seem like it had been frozen. However, Grandma's apple tartlet was much better, and Grandpa's chocolate 'Brooklyn Bridge' was the star. It's basically a chocolate mouse cake with hard chocolate bridge shapes on each side - adorable. After the desserts, there were a few little treats for the road which were also quite good.\n\nThe service was very good for the most part, especially the hostesses who helped us in and out. The table service was good, but their timing was slightly off. They brought the little soups first, then the cocktails, then the bread, then the wine list, which was sort of a funny order. Our actual waiter popped up a few times and started talking, interrupting our conversation rather than waiting for our attention. All in all though, it was a wonderful meal, a wonderful atmosphere and a wonderful setting. I am looking forward to going back some time to watch the sun go down over New York.", "author": "Colleen L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-20", "description": "Treated my girlfriend to birthday brunch here, was a beautiful event. I easily can recommend this place for a special event -- beautiful location, well prepared menu, reliable service.\n\nThe brunch menu is $55, 2-course fixed price. Paired with champagne and a dessert to share, the bill was expensive, but this is one of those iconic (albeit one of only 3 michelin star restaurants in Brooklyn) locations that you can pay a little more to enjoy.\n\nThe atmosphere was super classy -- beautiful autumnal florals in the main area and adorning the entrance, piano player throughout the meal, GORGEOUS views.\n\nCertainly a \"must do once\" kind of place.", "author": "Laura Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-08", "description": "5+ stars.

You have to get a full menu, which will bring your total for the evening to ca $300 with wine (that is after taxes and tips). But for a very special occasion it is worth it.

Perched on the water right under the Brooklyn Bridge, River Cafe is the classic date place. It has a beautiful, inviting garden as well. So ambiance is exceptional. My friend and I came here for lunch on Saturday; we walked in without reservations although we had to wait 10 min which didn't bother us at all. \n\nThe food was fantastic especially the Red Snapper special with artichoke puree and the Duck (specifically the duck and potato croquette--I could make a meal out of just that). Even though we were extremely full from our entrees, mimosas/bellinis, we had to order the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate dessert. It was delicious as expected. The macaroons, etc chocolate goodies that came with it were a nice surprise but not necessary. \n\nIt pains me to give this restaurant 4 out of 5 stars, but there is room for improvement on the service side. We sat in very tight quarters, and didn't get our check for a long time. We also had one server who had very shaky hands which made us nervous. We came during the busiest part of lunch (so the lack of attention was understandable but still downgraded them a tad in my book).", "author": "Vim I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-27", "description": "I had long heard of this place but for some reason never felt overly compelled to try it out.  But when my girlfriend scheduled my birthday brunch at River Cafe, I was excited to see what this restaurant was all about.  An abundance of beautiful plants and flowers adorn the entrance way and friendly hosts quickly seated us upon arriving.  We were seated side by side against the back wall and we got the privilege of looking out on the view they are famous for-the view of lower Manhattan and the east river.   My eyes were diverted from the view when a friendly waiter came over and presented us with the menus and offered us drinks.  The full 3 course brunch was seamless and all the food was delicious.  The service was totally on point with out being over being.  I could not put my finger on exactly what, but something about these place felt very grand to me.  It is the feeling that so many restaurants try to achieve but fall very short of achieving.  River Cafe was an amazing experience for brunch and I cannot wait to try it for dinner and see that iconic shot at nighttime, to say nothing of getting to be able to experience this first class establishment.", "author": "James K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-27", "description": "OK this is a great place. No, a fantastic place. The view is astonishing and the food amazing.\nThe food is great too, especially the foie gras and the wild rock lobster. I think rock lobster is much tastier than the regular Maine lobster.
