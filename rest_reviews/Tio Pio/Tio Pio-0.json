The typical meal deal is your choice of protein ranging from rotisserie chicken to pernil to fried fish fillets and 2 sides ranging from rice to plantains to salad. If that's not what you want, they have a decent sized salad bar with all the fixings. The seating area is not built for comfort but speed. You get your food, you sit down, you eat, you get out.\n\nI walked up to the counter and was immediately served. I chose pernil aka slow roasted pork with plantains and Mac and cheese.  The pernil was a nice mix of fatty and lean with crunchy skin seasoned well and not too salty. The Mac and cheese was aldente and not over cooked with enough cheese without it feeling too greasy. The plantains were a little under fried so it was a bit firmer than I prefer but wasn't too bad. I started getting full 3/4 way through but powered through and joined the clean plate club.\n\nIf you're in the area and want a good portion of delicious food at a very good price, this is the place for you.", "author": "Louis C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-04-18", "description": "Racist!!!!!! Towards other Spanish and black people. I  spent money at this establishment and the employees from the food area refused to provide me with the code to use the bathroom because I could not find my receipt. Knowingly I had paid for my  food there and a worker was trying to force a paying customer to walk to the register and get a receipt. I than personally refused to go back because they knew I am eating something from Tio Pio during lunch break downtown Brooklyn. I felt belittled as a paying customer I was embarrassed. I would never go back in this place and spend another dollar.

Good thing I did because I enjoyed my meal on lunch break.  Boy I wished I went here sooner the food is decent and with good portions. I would usually get a meal with the Tres (or 3 which is actually written on the sign  if you look for it lol)  Leches cake. This would last me lunch and dinner. They have enough seating for you to enjoy your meal. I don't sit in the restaurant because there is always space in the break room or on campus. If I would want to get away from everybody sitting there would be a great idea though. Unless if I'm in the area and in for a craving I would come here other wise I just keep it going. \n\nI have never had their breakfast. I've been told though by my old coworkers that it was affordable and good as well.\n\nThe servers are nice and engaging. When I used to frequent there I would always exsprience good service. Honestly the last time I was there was about a month ago and it was pretty consistent from the old working days. \n\nFor anyone, who in the downtown area everyday and is looking for something filling and affordable, this place is for you. Honestly filled up and the meal may last you for another meal.

Good amount of food for 8 bucks but quality was not good . \nOkay at best . Rice was hard . Sweet plantains were not good quality got lots of fat with my pernil. \nBeans on the other hand were great with very good flavor .\nI would order again because of the price but next time I'm going with a the grilled chicken instead of the pernil", "author": "Greg K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-23", "description": "Cheap, fast and huge portions at Tio Pio. There is a salad line and a hot food line. I was served right away - in and out (take-out) in five minutes. Many different meat and fish options with typical Spanish sides (rices, plantains, beans etc). \n\nLunch came to $9.25 with tax for 1/4 rotisserie chicken with 3 sides - I got spinach, yuca and Spanish rice. Food was fine - chicken had good flavor but was somewhat dry. Rice was great while yuca and spinach were just mediocre. I was certainly full after (couldn't even finish it all), so I would recommend for a quick, inexpensive lunch in Downtown Brooklyn.", "author": "Sol C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-07", "description": "Ordered over a dozen breakfasts to go for a work event occurring early in the AM.

You can get custom salads, juice/smoothies or a platter of delicious Spanish food.

The pancakes tasted of old grilled food. The eggs were not cooked to compketion and the bacon reeked of grease.  I myself ordered an empanada and wasn't pleased with the texture nor flavors.

There is no way a sandwich that cost me $5.75 on Friday should jump to $6.80 on Monday. You should at least warn your customers of the increase. They just sprung the new price on me at the counter.

I love it!  The atmosphere in the restaurant is lively.  But the selection of food takes the cake!  Anything from an empenada (sp?), to a salad bar, to a sandwich, to your selection of a hot meal (variety of rices, vegetables and meats).  For lunch you can get rice, 2 sides and one meat for $8.00.  And the portions are huge.  I never finish all in one sitting, so I save the remaining food for the next day.  Which is $4 for lunch each day.

The Tio Pio spinach wrap came with grilled chicken, zucchini, carrots, avocados, and the avocado based Tio Pio hot sauce.  I had a bone in my chicken that I had to remove, but otherwise the food was serviceable.  A bit on the bland side for my taste, but the namesake sauce kicked things up a notch.

My co-worker recommended this  restaurant to me.\n\nI had a taste for soup and salad. I ordered at the salad bar. They do have a wide variety of different salad toppings and different types of greens.\n\nI ordered Romaine with onions, 1 egg, bacon bits, carrots with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. The dressing tasted like nothing. It just made my salad moist / wet /taste like something was on there, but dressing had no flavor of any kind.\n\nAlso ordered chicken noodle soup. It tastes like the same chicken noodle soup that the Chinese restaurants (take out) serve. Nothing special. Bland not much flavor.\n\nThe good thing about the meal was that the portions were a nice size and I was full at work all day. Was not hungry at all. So that was good.\n\nThe customer service was not friendly, but I suppose what can you expect with a take-out spot, right?\n\nWill I order take out from here again? No, there are plenty of options down town Brooklyn.

Have to say, it was not your average gluten free bagel. I've noticed stores that do not specialise in gluten free food will use pre-made bagels (i.e. fresh \u0026 co) but no way were these pre-bought from another business. This bagel was SO thick and flavoursome I honestly got worried that it was a wheat bagel. Plus, they only charge 50 CENTS extra for a gluten free bagel!!!\n\nIf I had any concerns, it would be that they were pretty stingy with the  butter.
