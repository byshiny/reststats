But the service is so consistently bad that I can't, in good conscience give this any more than one star. Yes, it's that bad. I should also mention, it's kid central. Babies and children running around galore. That doesn't actually bother me, but it's note-worthy in case you care about that kind of thing. Every time I've been there, the service has been unapologetically slow. Whether there's 8 of us or 2 of us. But recently I was there with my husband and we walk in and ask a waitress if we seat ourselves and she rudely/dismissively said \"yeah, just sit wherever you want\". She did give us menus, but that was the last we saw of here. We sat there for 15 minutes, continually trying to flag down a server. Finally, I got up and asked a server to come over to us. I then saw him go to a table (for a second time) that got there 10 minutes after us. After a couple more minutes, we just decided to pick up some beers on our way home. No beer is worth that kind of service.", "author": "Marcy P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-14", "description": "Best schwarzwaelder kirschtorte outside of the black Forrest region so far, great beer selection including the best beer from that region on tap (rothaus tannenzaepfle)  , good atmosphere and all this for a decent price!\nStaff is friendly, also tried the landjaeger which was not traditionally (e.g. cold) but nevertheless delicious\nHave to come back for a full dinner", "author": "Philipp H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-26", "description": "Really good service, good food and a excellent selection of beers.\nCame here with some people to watch a World Cup game and the place was packed, so much that people were overflowing outside.

Not sure what kind of coffee they brew, but it was one of the best cups I've had in a while, so I'm looking forward to finding out. We shared the goulash soup, which was seasoned really nicely, a \"brezel,\" which went perfectly with the mustard that accompanied it, and the bratwurst. Damn, that bratwurst was awesome, and it had just the right amount of smoke (sorry, you caught me mid-season of Top Chef, so I'm borrowing a little bit of Collichio speak). \n\nI really hesitate to take one star off for the slow service because I know they haven't even had their hard opening yet and they're probably in the process of hiring more waitstaff, but it did take forever to get our check. Once they get in the groove, if the food remains fantastic (and I don't see why it wouldn't), I'll tack on the fifth star in a heartbeat!

We were so happy to find authentic Flammkuchen, which is hard to find in the US.  Brezel was also very good.  Actually everything we had was good.  We did see a guy sitting at another table drinking from a giant size \"das boot.\"  Yikes.  Wish they didn't even have it available.  So tacky.

Spicy citrus kale was interesting, I liked it. I normally don't like sauerkraut, but their preparation was ok.\n\nI also had a pretzel, which was delicious by itself. The spicy mustard that it came with was too strong, so I didn't use it very much.\n\nThe service was a bit lacking. We had a new waitress, and she had a hard time with the menu, which lists most items in German, so I can understand her difficulty.

The reason I didn't give it more stars is because of the terrible service. When we got to the restaurant it was busy so we asked the waiter if we could sit somewhere. He seemed frazzled and suggested we sit at a table a couple of guys were about to leave. When my friend said, \"are those people waiting for the table\"(referring to some women standing near it) the waiter told us in an annoyed and put upon tone that he didn't know. He then walked away. We finally sat down and after waiting over 10 mins., had to flag a waiter to order. Once the food came, our waiter didn't check on us once. In order to get the check I had to go to the service station and request it. \nI won't go back here due to the service issues.", "author": "Lake S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-25", "description": "Favorite place to work in Brooklyn.

That night it was not busy when we arrived but none of the large tables were available for our group of 6. The waiter said a table would be opening soon almost an hour later but another group that showed up later sat themselves down and the waiter tried to get us to stay and eat in the waiting area on benches instead. When we reminded him we were here first, he said the other table has already sat down and he didn't want to ask them to move because he wanted to avoid a scene. \n\nI've never seen or heard of anything like this happen - usually employees are happy to stand up for their customers. And never have I witnessed a scene from asking a group to move if they weren't next in line. My only experience with both others being asked to move on our behalf and being asked to move is that people are happy to do so. The other party was not aware there was another party waiting - they were at the bar drinking - and it was the employee's job to manage everyone's wait. \n\nUnfortunately because of this experience my cousin's birthday was ruined and we ended up walking around the area to find dinner since we were all starving by the end of the wait and sadly, I can't review the food itself!", "author": "Vera H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "Great selection of beer in different sizes to cater to lightweights and lushes alike.
