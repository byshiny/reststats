The food was very subpar and made my stomach hurt afterward. I do NOT recommend coming here if you're looking for Mexican food in dumbo. Please save your money!!

We sat outside so the service was pretty slow, and the waitress seemed overwhelmed. The food was okay, but could have been much better. Kind of left you with that \"I just ate cheap Mexican food\" feeling that many know all too well. The house margaritas weren't strong at all, and the cups that came with the pitcher were TINY. What stood out most though was the rice- it seemed severely undercooked, so that it was actually crunchy. Honestly, it reminded me of play-doh. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Sandra B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-06", "description": "This was such a great place!

As an appetizer, I ordered chicken empanadas and a chicken quesadilla idk if it was cause I was starving or if it was really good but I enjoyed that however, everything went downhill from there. I ordered what should've been a chicken fajita and what I got was chicken saut\u00e9ed in Sazon ,salt no cheese and no grilled peppers. I'm not Wolfgang puck or Martha Stewart but I think most Tex-Mexican restaurants have the same aesthetics that everyone loves for a reason. Cheese more cheese jalape\u00f1os chiles tomatillo salsa sauce sour cream lettuce and more cheese. Last time I checked,no Mexican restaurant cooks with that sazon shit. Idc if one place uses a white onion over a purple one just make the food taste good. In addition to this nasty ass expensive food they serve Pedro's automatically add gratuity to your bill (their service wasn't even all that tbh) I guess they have to pay that high ass dumbo rent so they trickle that down to customers. Clearly, this is an establishment that doesn't care about the food they serve.

It took a really long time to even get noticed for service and we had to flag down three different waiters to get assistance, and then repeat our order a few times.\n\nThe chips and guac were ok but nothing special. Actually, this entire venue has nothing special about it. The air circulation was also awful as the fajitas coming by kept smoking up the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the chorizo quesadilla and it was ok, but nothing I couldn't whip up at home.\n\nThankfully, the meal was incredibly cheap.", "author": "Michelle C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-23", "description": "Name of the restaurant is actually a bit misleading.  It's more Mexican/Puerto Rican/Dominican food.  I had Mexican food and it was pretty good, albeit, not authentic Mexican food but still good.  This is the type of place you come to after work to just have some beers, good food and laugh.  \n\nThe decor makes you feel like you're walking into a cozy, casual, modest bar.

Food was somewhat good, but the staff definitely destroyed any potential of it being enjoyable. From the bartender/waiter having a complete attitude and arguing when I was clearly stating that there was something wrong with the drink instead of simply fixing it like any normal bartender would (I would know as I bartended for many years), the amount of time that it took for him to even come over to us when it wasn't even that busy, to the time it took to bring anything out and waiting 30 minutes just to get the check was awful. Best part was him charging extra to fix the drink that he made improperly in the first place. Sad because I used to really like this place years ago and decided to come back and show it to my friend; obviously won't be returning thanks to the lack of professionalism from the staff. I've never felt bad about paying a check until today. The reason for my review is so that management/owners do something about this as it would be a shame for such a beautiful and unique restaurant to lose customers because of unprofessional staff.", "author": "Taya D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-19", "description": "Holy crap, this place is horrendous! My friend and I came here for lunch today and I'd been here once for drinks a few years ago. We were seated right away and that was the speediest part of the service. They were extremely slow and the place was pretty quiet. They didn't come over once during our meal to see if we wanted or needed anything. They didn't even give us water when we sat down. Additionally the staff was pretty rude. The woman brought the check to us before we were even finished, not bothering to ask us if we wanted anything more, which brings me to what was supposed to be the food. \n\nWe both ordered a burrito and it was pretty expensive but I figured it would be a decent sized one. The joke was on us. It was tiny! The toppings that were supposed to come with it were laughable and the flavor didn't exist. Even the michelada was disappointing. For $10 and $12 respectively it was ridiculous. There wasn't even a side of beans or anything. We got chips and salsa. The chips were stale and the salsa was so salty that it was inedible. I wish I could give this awful place zero stars. Save your money and time and avoid this place like the plague.", "author": "D.

I didn't it would be fair to judge Pedro's solely on their chicken taco. I decided to ask the waiter what was the most popular dish on the menu.

It would've been a fine experience had it come out 10 minutes after ordering, or if it had cost a more fair price. As it was, it took 45 minutes from ordering our food to getting it, which, for an order of fish tacos, nachos, and flautas, seems a bit extreme. When the food arrived it was fine, but nothing to rave about. \n\nI will not be returning, and I'd advise avoiding, as the food wasn't worth the wait, nor was it worth the cost.", "author": "Jack M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-03", "description": "Great atmosphere, great food.
