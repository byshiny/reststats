I landed upon Karasu, a self-described seasonal izakaya in Fort Greene. \n\nA good friend of mine actually introduced me to Karasu after her boyfriend brought her here for an anniversary dinner. It's one of those \"hidden\" NY restaurants which requires you to saunter down a dark hallway near the rear of Walter's - wondering all the while if you're about to burst in on the kitchen staff (or worse still, a poor soul in the restroom). But fear not, there is indeed a restaurant at the end of this particular hallway. \n\nAll the menu items can be shared, but are divided between smaller and larger plates. The beauty of the food here is how the chef has managed to make everything taste so deliciously fresh - even when it has been fermented or (deep) fried (multiple times).  \n\nMust trys here for me: the COCKTAILS (so good), the karaage and the sashimi. \n\nIf you want to read more about my dinner @ Karasu (or other things I'm eating at the moment) feel free to pop on over to my blog:\nhttps://www.cardinaldirections-blog.com/\n\nCheers!", "author": "Anna L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-26", "description": "Score one for the neighborhood!

It is kinda cool to walk in from the din of rowdy Walter's to the sophisticated chill atmosphere of Karasu.\n\nCocktails are spot on (started with a Negroni, which had the perfect sweet aromatics contrasting the bitter savoriness on the tongue, in contrast to pretenders that make 'em too syrupy) and every single dish ordered hit the mark: we had pickled veggies, the celery salad and ikura salad, karaage fried chicken thighs and the reason for out visit, koji dry aged steak, which is probably the most tender piece of prime cut beef in NYC, and more importantly, freaking delicious, nothing fills your entire mouth with such savory umami.  \n\nThe tare that came with steak turned the meat into what Japanese call \"rice thief\" ie, so savory and flavorful, cries out for spoonfuls of rice, and a bowl of perfectly cooked short grains accompanies the steak.  I also asked for a side of salt, which wasn't necessary per se, but i wanted to enjoy the meat sans sauce as well as with the tare - I recommend you do that if you like salt.  I brought a bottle of Bordeaux ('86 Calon Segur, which is drinking perfectly right now btw) to go with the steak, and for a $25 corkage it's well worth it (because steak and red wine are soulmates and the pairing was incredible.  \n\nKarasu bills itself as a neighborhood joint but for those of us less blessed living in Manhattan, it's def worth a special trek out to crooklyn.", "author": "Jay K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-24", "description": "Disclaimer: This review is a couple months after my visit so forgive me if I forget some of the full details.\n\nKarasu, where have you been all my life!? This adorable hidden restaurant, located in the back of Walter's in Fort Greene, is absolutely perfect. PERFECT. The buzzy ambiance was great for our date night (lots of great people watching). You can't beat the fantastic cocktails and sake selection and the authentic Japanese eats with a twist from the chefs. Kudos to chefs Yael Peet and Elena Yamamoto for executing some of the best Japanese dishes I have had outside of Japan! Here's what we ordered:\n\n-Pickled Vegetables Three Ways:  Being a huge fan of pickles, especially Japanese pickles, this simple dish was light and tasty. Great for a starter snack!\n-Sayoko's Karaage Boneless Fried Chicken:  I think this is a mandatory must order. This fried chicken was incredible! Super crispy on the outside and the two sauce options are both absolutely delightful.\n-Tonkatsu Fried Berkshire Pork Chop:  After visiting Japan in 2016, I find myself almost always on the hunt for a delicious Tonkatsu pork that will compare to what I had overseas. Thankfully at Karasu, I finally found a match! Super crispy and accompanied by an incredible sauce, we were fighting for the last bite.\n\nWe had more dishes and I wish I could remember what they were. I will definetely be returning because this place is just too good to go just once. Honorable mention to our incredible server, I wish I could remember her name (Melissa? Heather? She was brunette and the nicest ever!).

You will feel instantly transported the moment you walk through the black door at Walter's. Staff and service are impeccable, and the vibe is cozy but not crowded. Drinks are FANTASTIC - my fave was the Night Night (sort of like a spicy plum Manhattan), and served in adorable vintage glasses. The food was outstanding. We eat a lot for two people, so we got two small plates and two large plates and it was perfect: miso potato salad, duck karaage, handmade uni pasta and sizzling prime rib for two. Everything was bursting with flavor, and the duck had one of the most unique sauces I've tasted in a long time. We had room for desert and got a scoop of maple walnut ice cream and sage ice cream.

It's in the back of Walters, and when you walk in, and go to the back door to enter Karasu, it feels as if you are quite important.  It's fun!  When you just walk in, the staff from Walters will usually say, \"Oh!  So, a table for (2)\"?  You will then say politely, \"We're here to go to Karasu, the place in the back\"!  Then nod your head in the direction of the back door.  They will then guide you to the back door and you will enter an entirely different restaurant, and it will feel like you are changing dimensions.  We ordered the rice balls, which were a little bland by itself, but with soy sauce, they were much tastier.  Inside the rice, there is salmon, which was a surprise as we thought it was tuna.  Next I got the miso soup, and it was refreshing - although I think they could have added more tofu.  For the main course, I received rice, (yes more rice), topped with sashimi, caviar, and corn.  The sashimi's texture was amazing, and the corn was crunchy.  As for the steak, it was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful.  The only thing was that there was way too much fat.  It was kind of hard to eat.  But the taste made up for that.

Their specials are pretty good too: the grilled fish is juicy and done to perfection. \n\nWe've always managed to get a spot at karasu, it's a pretty bar with a relaxed vibe despite the fact that it's a speakeasy.

The food is traditionally Japanese with some extra touches...and it better because the prices are a bit steep. I love cocktails and Karasu did not disappoint. I had the One Flight Up with a shiso leaf inside...shiso is one of my favorite things on this planet. My second cocktail was Shades of Green, which was tasty, but had a slight sweetness I wasn't so into. My husband had the oysters with slices of kumquats on top. The karaage was sooooo juicy, tender, perfectly crispy and the mustard-mayo side had some unique taste to it that I couldn't place. My husband had the seafood udon, which he enjoyed, but being more of a traditionalist, he didn't quite get why the lobster pieces were part of it. I had the tonkatsu. I have had tonkatsu more times than I can remember all over Japan and here in NYC. This was the largest portion of tonkatsu I've ever had and they left it on the bone, which I've never seen done. It came with mustard, pickles, rice and a side of cabbage. Because it is quite heavy, I would have rather had the cabbage without the mayo. Traditionally the cabbage comes very thinly sliced and plain to counter the oily heaviness of the fried meat. In the end, I needed my husband to finish off the meal because it was way more than I could handle considering we had a few apps to go with it. \n--All together we had 2 cocktails, 1 sake, 1 beer, 3 appetizers, 2 large plates and 5 oysters...with tip the total was $185 for 2 people.--", "author": "Nicole M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-24", "description": "Karasu is truly a gem in Fort Greene.

As I am waiting for the restroom I decide to see if the third door is available...  but this is not a regular door.  \n\nNo this is the Narnia entrance to Karasu... a Japanese secret izakaya!? Say what?  How much did I imbibe? I peer in and see a demure lady wiping down delicate silverware.  I immediately apologize and close the door as I assume I am unwelcome.  The contrary!  The host of Walter's appears and glowingly tells me this establishment is about to open in a few days' time and that I should certainly come back.  So I did.... At the first chance I could and was not disappointed. \n\nReservations were secured for the hopping opening Friday night and the atmosphere was one of understated elegance.  Abuzz with excitement and a timeless glow.... people were enjoying themselves and the yummy delights on the menu.  I included, as soon as I took the first sip of my honeydew cocktail, Shades of Green, rum, honeydew, mint, aloe.  The mint and melon were a perfectly refreshing compliment for a humid summer night and a welcome revisiting of a mojito-esque cocktail ..... yet ever so reminiscent of my southern agricultural heritage of eating melons in the country.\n\nUpon opening the menu I adored their little pelican man art deco inspired graphic.  Similar to the toothpick birds of asia | Link (https://www.google.com/search?q=toothpick+bird\u0026rlz=1C1CHMO_enGB513GB517\u0026espv=2\u0026biw=1527\u0026bih=877\u0026source=lnms\u0026tbm=isch\u0026sa=X\u0026ved=0ahUKEwir_Ku08azNAhWIbSYKHaeNDGoQ_AUIBygC)\n\nI highly recommend the Karaage duck wings with the spicy sesame and scallions on top.  So delicious we nearly ordered a second round but showed restraint and patience for the rest of the menu to carry us away.  \n\nI am a sucker for anything Kampachi, so I ordered the crudo with koji and shiso leaf.  It was tiny, light and delicate and could have done for a larger portion but alas New York fine dining sends these out as tiny hamster burritos | Link (https://www.google.com/search?q=toothpick+bird\u0026rlz=1C1CHMO_enGB513GB517\u0026espv=2\u0026biw=1527\u0026bih=877\u0026source=lnms\u0026tbm=isch\u0026sa=X\u0026ved=0ahUKEwir_Ku08azNAhWIbSYKHaeNDGoQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch\u0026q=tiny+hamster+eating+tiny+food) .. and I enjoyed them.\n\nThe Mizuna, barley, sea beans, Meyer lemon, chili was unique and had a little bit of a hot kick to it that sneaks up on you.  Loved the use of the sea beans, as they aren't something you come across often but add a nice salty crispy bite to the greens.  \n\nStill thinking about the duck wings when the whole dorade with shiso pesto and a side of seaweed dusted miso rice comes out... it was perfection.  This is an interactive dish that you are eating with chopstick and fingers and breaking apart happily and deliciously.  Not for those folks afraid of fish bones, be aware. All hands on deck errr fish. The fatty skin and taste of the white filet inside are not to be missed, so yummy and lightly cooked and seasoned.\n\nThe next cocktail was worlds away from the first in terms of personality..  The Dipper mouth: bourbon, black walnut, cr\u00e8me de banane, cold brew. Yes this sh!t is bananas, b-a-n-a-n-E... a crazy little curve ball of flavour and served with a large ice sphere I like to refer to as a mini death star in your drink.  The cold brew is very noticeable; highly recommend this strong, complex libation.\n\nSpecial of the night was a lobster tagliatelle with smoky butter. The pasta was cooked exactly right and the smoky butter was something that would have made Julia Child and Ron Swanson swoon..  \n\nSimple dessert selection in the true authentic Japanese style.. Ice cream - Ginger, Black Sesame, Green Tea Matcha cannot go wrong with any of these.  Believe they get them from il Laboratorio... so obviously on point.  \n\nLooking forward to coming back to try all of the inventive cocktails again soon.", "author": "Ashley S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-16", "description": "Went with my hubby and baby for a dinner. The ambience is very casual and the staffs were friendly. I don't think it is a restaurant that is suitable to dine with kids (dimmed light, candles, bar setting, small tables) but they tried very hard to accommodate us which is a huge plus! They tried to make space for the stroller and got us a high chair. \n\nThe food was pretty amazing. We had oysters, edamame and the rib eye steak for two. The oysters were very fresh and flavorful. Edamame was...edamame. :p. Okay....They put some yuzu flavor on it which was nice. \n\nThe rib eye steak for 2 was sizzling when served. However it only came with 1 bowl of rice. That was puzzling because this dish was meant for 2 people. We ordered another bowl of rice which cost $3......  The steak was tasty but too oily. There were chunk of fat that needed to be trimmed before cooking. It was very very fatty. The first 2 pieces at the edge of the steak were mostly fat. The flavor was good but I wish it was just less oily. There was a puddle of oil on the plate when we finished the dish. \n\nOverall we enjoyed the food and the dining experience.

The overall ambience was great- relaxed, not too loud, nice vibe. The cocktails and sake were excellent and interesting and lived up to the reviews. The food however was disappointing. We had the Japanese wild mushrooms which were fine but nothing special and not worth the price. The karaage was probably the best thing we ate- crispy and moist chicken with yummy side sauces. For entrees we had seafood udon and tonkatsu. Seafood udon was extremely flavorless and the noodles soggy. Seafood quality not great either. Had to add soy sauce and mustard to salvage it. Tonkatsu was kind of dry and tough even with the sauce coated on top.

We snacked on duck wings and pickles and imbibed on the Dipper Mouth, Thrice Rice, and Night Night,  My favorite was the Night Night, it was simple, balanced and showcased the smokiness of the Brandy. The Thrice rice was nicely balanced with the hint of sweetness from the almond, its a nice drink if you like darker liquors but want some sweetness to it. The Dipper Mouth was a little too sweet for us the cr\u00e8me de Banana didn't do it for us with the scotch and the coffee. \n\nOverall, the d\u00e9cor is open, Japanese inspired, with clean lines.
