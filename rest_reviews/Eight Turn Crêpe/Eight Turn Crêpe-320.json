This - one person running the show almost flawlessly (she had to toss the first crepe and redo it) - was just the start of 8TC putting VLC 2 doors down to shame. The tofu edameme salad crepe and lychee valentine dessert crepe were both phenomenally light on the crepe (thanks to rice flour) and generous with the fillings. This is, even more importantly, in stark contrast to the similarly priced, far less inventive creperie 'next door'. That said, it's a small storefront with barely enough space to enjoy your purchase(s) on the stools near the window (lot of different displays too), so just ate a few yards away Petrosino Square amid Christmas trees on an unseasonably warm day**. They one-up Vive La Crepe!*** here too by providing a perforated crepe-serving vessel AND a tearable plastic carrying bag. I'm almost tempted to retroactively dock VLC after seeing what crepes can be, but that ain't right (especially since PayPal's fascination with crepes means I've spent almost nothing there for quite a few crepes and loyalty points).\n\n*Oddly not their normal $20 - but the 8 is a clever touch.\n**Must be what the holidays feel like in regions without seasons.\n***Obnoxious punctuation theirs.\n\nPayPal transaction:\n12/3/2013  Tofu Edamame  1 $8.75 $8.75\n12/3/2013  Lychee Valentine  1 $9.00 $9.00\nTotal $19.33 USD\n\nPayPal in the house this time for my second $18 redemption:\n12/13/2013  Seaweed Sesame (perfectly balanced) 1 $8.00 $8.00\n12/13/2013  Azuki Berries (a sublime indulgence with the ice cream hitting the spot even on a sub-freezing day) 1 $9.50 $9.50\nTotal $19.05 USD\n\n12/18/2013  Truffled Eggwhite Omelet  (They triple-bagged this bad boy, clearly keen on the fact that it's a messy and still delicious creation - I'd dare to say thrice as messy as my previous purchases.

Wish I'm living in the neighbor so that I can eat everyday. I had the truffle egg white savory crepe and I love it. Full of healthy energy and flavors. They made the egg white and saut\u00e9ed mushroom from raw right in front of you, no hidden ingredients. Even though I waited for about 7-10 minutes, but it's totally worth it because I enjoyed watching them making my crepe.

The place is cute, though seating is sparse (a bench and two or three seats). There was a large variety of options, ranging from sweet to savory. While I had a tough time deciding, I ultimately settled for the Eight Turn Lox: a savory crepe with lox, cream cheese, capers, onions, and spinach. To top it off, I ordered the yuzu soda.\n\nThe crepe as a whole was not terrible but I was definitely expecting more crunch and a bit more ingredients in the crepe. I do understand that lox is a more pricey ingredient but the amount I got for something that's priced at $9.50 was just an utter disappointment.", "author": "Judy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-09", "description": "First time here today, I had the lychee valentine, and it didn't come with rose petals; yes I was looking forward to trying edible rose petals.

Happy to discover their crepes are gluten-free and made with rice flour.  The server was very attentive. Not much room or seating. I got the 'double the eggs, double the fun' crepe. It wasn't a problem (or an extra cost) to switch the chedder cheese to avocado. Great taste - maybe a little too sweet. I also got the 'eight turn lox'. That was good too. \n\nMore than once I had turned up because they looked open or were supposed to be open, only to be told they were still closed and would open at 11am. This inconsistency is annoying and is at odds with some online sources. Plus why not open earlier, crepes make a good breakfast.", "author": "Jill B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-24", "description": "I have fond memories of the savory Chicken Teriyaki crepe with avocado.  It didn't really taste like typical chicken teriyaki but it satisfied my hunger.  The avocado was a nice touch, however it cost extra making the meal less than economical.  The next time I tried the sweet Harajuku Fruit Cocktail and I found it to be a lackluster experience, skimpy and borderline bland. Perhaps I was hungry the first time or maybe their savory crepes are just better than their sweet ones.", "author": "Chrystina C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-26", "description": "Mmmm.. dare I say I might have enjoyed this Japanese crepe in NYC more than the Japanese crepes I had in Japan?  So delicious!  And gluten-free to boot.  I only had a chance to try the Azuki Berries crepe, but it satisfied my craving x100.  Strawberries, azuki (aka red) beans, whipped yogurt, green tea matcha custard, almonds, pocky sticks, and Il Laboratoria del Gelato matcha green tea gelato--layered together inside a delicious crepe!  At first, looked like it would be hard to eat, but the paper cone it comes in makes it easy (it's perforated so it rips easily).  Service comes with a smile.  The place is very small though--can probably only seat 5 or so people inside.", "author": "Mandy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-08", "description": "How much more stretch can my skimpy black dresses endure! After an arduous Sunday work day, did I make my dinner a protein building, vitamin filled, super energizing meal?After a promise to detox from a Labor Day weekend spent eating fried foods and ice cream by Chesapeake Bay did I stick to my goals? Well...err...all good intentions were busted when I read Max S.'s review of the day for Eight Turn Crepe. Then visions of conical crepes danced in my head. So much for brain food. This was tummy love food all the way.\n\nEight Turn Crepe is a tiny eatery with two small tables and about 5 guys squeezed behind the counter...with one taking orders, and 3-4 all making those conical culinary delights. One guy was spreading the crepe batter with the zen beauty of a Tibetan monk tending to his sand painting. My matcha crepe chef was swirling spirals and custard and fruit and chocolate and nuts with the artistry of a true pastry chef in the making. I disagree with Yelper Taylor about the poor service. The gentlemen I spoke to were very  friendly, especially the one closest to the counter. Poor fellow, I think I made him nervous snapping their photos and he did make some holey crepes, which went promptly into the dumpster. You mean they don't have a Sumo in the back eating the irregulars? But if these guys are indeed a little less zealous, remember how little space they have to maneuver. You might be put off too with your elbows knocking those of your neighbor chef. These superheroes of the creperie work in tight spaces and one guy, an Asian fellow, kept doing his zen thing with the batter, despite all the distractions. Mr. Friendly, the guy closest to the counter, even said goodbye and said he hoped I'd be back. You betcha, with my crepe gobbling friends and family, for sure.\n\nThe Japanese have a knack for improving on inventions. They were clever enough to put this giant crepe, stuffing and all, into a paper cone that you can peel as you eat away. Sweet crepes are $6.50 to $9.50 with $1 for additions, and savories $6 to $9.50. Then there are salad crepes...hmmmm...they all sound good...brings to mind moo shu pancakes Japanese style. Well, I debated between Max's S's Chocolate Nut Party and Matcha and the latter won this round. I chomped and chomped on my Matcha Stripe Chocolate crepe which had ripe strawberries, chocolate sauce, homemade truffles, whipped yogurt, matcha custard, crushed pistachios. Dinner? Protein...err...voila Crepe!  Ah, life is indeed good.\n\nOn little thing..I have to agree with Agustin K. I would have preferred my crepe warmer, but maybe it doesn't roll well when it does.I would have detracted 1/2 a star but hey, let's not split hairs. Let's enjoy 8 Turn Crepes instead.", "author": "Helen Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-10", "description": "Oh. My. God. The crepes here are to die for!! It was definitely worth the wait.  I came here around 7pm and the line was out the door! I guess to be fair the place this kind of small so there isn't a lot of standing room. Anyways,  they have both savory and sweet crepes. Most of them range from 8 to 10 dollars.  I opted for the sweet crepes because they sound pretty appetizing.  I ended up picking the lychee valentine crepe.  It has lychee (obviously),  raspberries,  whipped cream,  flower petals and almonds on top and I also chose to have matcha green tea included. I have to say that the green tea ice cream was delicious!! One of the best I've tasted actually.  The crepe itself was not soggy and has a good texture to it,  they definitely know what they're doing with that batter formula! It definitely got me full after I was finished,  so I got what I paid for. I highly recommend this place if you're in for a sweet treat!! I will definitely come back and try their savory crepes one day! Oh and and they have a loyalty card too so don't forget to snatch one from them and rack up your crepes!", "author": "Fiona D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-08", "description": "There is a nice selection the types of crepes, savory or sweet. I feel like the crepes were alittle pricey for its size.\nI disliked how its a pretty small place so i had to stand outside to eat. When I was eating I swore I got like 10 billion stares.\nI had no clue what to get, so I got the basic strawberry and banana with the green tea ice cream. Honestly if it wasnt because of the ice cream I don't think it would have tasted that good. I felt like some of the banana tasted werid?\nMy friend got the azuki berries, I thought that tasted pretty good but thats probably why its more pricey.", "author": "Amy C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-08", "description": "After dinner, we walked around Soho and decided to yelp a dessert spot.

A nice scoop of ice cream plus fresh blueberries all around, custard cream and whip cream. Utterly delicious. They also have savory crepes. It was delish so I am definitely trying a savory crepe next time I stop by. The spot is a lil small but they do have seating. The staff was friendly and I loved the decor.
