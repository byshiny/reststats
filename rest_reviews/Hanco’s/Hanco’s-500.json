Line with out the door which usually symbolizes good food, but when I got to the counter the place looked very dirty and messy.

A co-worker waited a half hour there once, and I've had to wait 15 minutes.... and other times, less than 10. They kind of go at their own, meandering pace.\n\nBut I dunno, I guess the trade-off is that the sandwiches are amazing, and addicting. I always get either the shredded chicken or the classic-- mild. I can't get it spicy, or else I'm in for a world of hurt.\n\nThe bread's always fresh, the daikon and carrots are always crisp, and I never have any complaints about the food quality. I'd kind of prefer, maybe, if the shrimp-filled summer rolls didn't sit out on the counter, in the non-air conditioned storefront during the summer. I mean, I'm sure they don't sit out all day and aren't full of bacteria but it's just NICER to see your summer roll come out of a fridge. It makes you wanna throw that shrimp back. Room-temperature summer rolls, eh, not so much.\n\nI've also enjoyed the taro and coconut bubble teas, though haven't tried any others. Unfortunately, I had sworn to myself not to buy lunch tomorrow but just writing this review has given me a hankering like nobody's business.", "author": "Danielle G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-17", "description": "I have tried all the banh mi here and I would have to say the classic is my favorite.

I typically go with the tofu sandwich (mild) which is served on the freshest of baguettes. Be careful of the peppers if you order your sandwich \"hot.\" A few friends who can handle heat have been burned a few times by the peppers.

I know it doesn't taste the same but I think it's good enough for me. Whenever I order the tofu sandwich (minus the butter and mayonnaise with extra hot sriracha sauce) , its especially hot which i love. Steaming hot tofu almost on the verge of burning your tongue at every bite. So much flavor going with the tofu (or chicken, etc) pickled vegetables, cucumbers, cilantro, and sauce. Every bite is filled with deliciousness. The different flavors and textures just works altogether. I love how they're so generous on the pickled daikon and carrots. They give an enormous amount which sometimes its hard to eat the sandwiches. The cucumber and cilantro really gives off a nice refreshing finish to the bite. The sandwich is pretty big, so whenever I manage to finish it, I feel stuffed and ready to hit the road! \n\nI've had the regular banh mi on the white french baguette when I can share it with the boyfriend. It's pretty good I admit.\n\nThe vietnamese coffee. Just yum and it goes perfectly with the sandwich! I usually come here for the coffee whenever I'm in the area and I need a energy fix before work. It's really sweet because of the condensed milk but vietnamese coffee is so nice, distinctly bold, dark and rich. YUM. I even got myself a tin of the coffee grounds with the filter at home but it just doesn't taste the same. I guess I'm not much of a barista eh.\n\nBEST PART, buy nine sandwiches, and get the tenth free!", "author": "Jenn N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-10", "description": "Awesome vietnamese sandwiches, tried 3-4 places around the area and this has been the best, cheapest, and most generous so far.

Will I be able to squeeze in one more trip?\n\nTasty with a capital T!  I have to say I like these banh mis  much better than the ones I've had in the Tenderloin of SF.  Sure it's 2 dollars more at a steeping $4.25, but I feel like the quality of the meat and the freshness of the bread \u0026 veggies is well worth it.  Because of my fear of questionable meat (due to some unpleasant experiences with these french vietnamese sandwiches), I actually ordered a rice vermicelli bowl with tofu..which was good.  I stole a couple bites from my friend's pork chop banh mi and was pleasantly surprised.  Hot, perfectly spiced - salty sweet - and orgasmic!  We had managed to get an order of summer rolls, banh mi, vermicelli with two teas for about $10/each.

I think this place is a little better than the place up on Atlantic (and closer to my place, so maybe I'm biased). You can't beat 5.25 for a delicious sandwich.
