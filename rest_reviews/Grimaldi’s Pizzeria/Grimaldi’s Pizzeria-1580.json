Two hour wait to get inside and then wait upstairs for another 90 minutes.

This Grimaldi's however is no better (or worse) than the one in Long Island that I had already been to..and it didn't have a line because..well it's in Long Island. Pizza was great but I've had it before elseswhere and for some reason I expected it to be twice as good since I had to wait 45 minutes for a table.\n\nOne concept that seems completely asinine, is that you have to wait on the same long line even if you just want to order for take out and they just do not pick up the phone if you try to call it in. I think the hype may get fulfilled by some, but not this girl because I've had my share of brick oven pizza and the food was great but the wait was not.", "author": "Samantha S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-24", "description": "I have found my favorite place for New York Style pizza...right here at Grimaldi's!

There is obviously a lot of hype around this place, which is built mainly b/c of the crazy lines at the brooklyn location.\n\nThe pizza was ok...I've had better personally, but I think it is a matter of taste b/c they do something unique, which is that they use FRESH MOZZARELLA.  I personally didn't care for it because it wasn't scattered everywhere and had sort of a rubbery texture instead of creamy, but I think that depends on each person's individual taste buds b/c my friend who normally doesn't love pizza really liked it.\n\nSo to each their own.\n\nIf I was on a trip to new york, I would look at this location as a tourist spot b/c its famous and in a cool location under the bridge and next to an ice cream place, but I would try to go to a different grimadli's location or pizza place entirely.", "author": "Rubin K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-14", "description": "The pizza is good and not too greasy and the ingredients are very fresh.

The wait wasn't long for us. We got lucky I guess. The door guy took a liking to our daughter and we miraculously skipped over half the line and the long wait. I think that made the pizza taste even better! :) The interior reminded me of a small town pizzeria - kinda kitschy with the red checkered table cloth but in a cute endearing way. It also smelled fantastic inside! The smell of garlic and basil was like heaven! \n\nWe ordered a regular cheese pizza to see what the hype was about and a couple Brooklyn root beers. I had a good view of the pizza making area and enjoyed watching them make pies! They top all of them with Olive oil which was interesting. The pizza came quick and it was awesome. The fresh basil and the crust was what set this pizza apart from any other pie I've had. Crisp but still chewy mild tomato sauce and the cheese. Oh the cheese! The fresh mozzarella made the difference in this pie. I'm glad that we tried the \"best pizza in NY\".

The service was good too.

Fortunately there were only 2 of us. We got picked to sit after about 10-15 minutes. We got seated in the corner, nice and cozy. The waiter never looked our way. People were then seated next to us and then in the table next to them. We were seated first mind you. After about 10 minutes of receiving no service I finally caught the eye of a waiter who proceeded to tell me that he would be with me in a moment. He then proceeded to wait on the two neighboring tables and then box the leftovers of a third table. When he finished he finally arrived at our table acting like he was doing us a favor. \n\nHe took our drink orders and when he finally returned (after another 10 minutes or so) he took our pizza order. When the pizza finally arrived (another 20 minutes) he put it on our table and disappeared, NEVER TO RETURN! He never came back to ask if everything was ok, if we needed refills on drinks or anything. He didn't even bring our bill. I had to get it from someone else.\n\nPizza was soggy, not crisp. Way over-rated, and way too pricey.  Don't waste your time or money at this tourist trap.  I know we won't again.

I brought my husband and sister in law here on her visit to the city.  She wanted some authentic NY pizza, and we were not disappointed in our experience.  \n\nWe waited in line for maybe an hour and a half on a Saturday night, and our order took a while to get to our table, but the pizza was really yummy and the atmosphere was fun.  You can see them making the pizzas with their hands, the big brick oven, and all the fresh mozzarella behind a sneeze guard.  They also had a bar... I don't know if you have to wait in line for the bar top, but you did for take out, so probably for the bar, too...\n\nWe got two pizzas, and enjoyed both topping combos, but found the pepperoni to be quite greasy.  The antipasti was a nice start to calm our ravenous hunger after waiting in line and then another wait for a freshly baked pizza.  Beer, wine, and local sodas are the beverage list. A little pricey.  My husband still raves about the pizza. It was even more delicious cold the next day.  \n\nNo credit cards, no slices, no reservations, no delivery.", "author": "Renee B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-15", "description": "1) Go between 3-4:30 PM.

My expectations were extremely high, and my experience was less than satisfying. Thankfully, I came on a Thursday afternoon around 3:30pm, when there was only one other party ahead in line. The wait was about 10 minutes, which was not bad at all, considering the stories I've heard about people trying to get seated.\n\nIt took the waiter over 15 minutes to take our order, which was only one large pizza. We ordered our pizza with sausage and mushrooms. When it came after 30 minutes, I was less than impressed. The pizza, quite frankly, was tasteless. The tomato sauce was bland, and the only flavor came from the crumbled sausage, which was one of the only decent aspects of the meal. While I liked the consistency and thinness of the crust, I expected the sweet charred flavor that the crust at Lombardi's has. This pizza had none.\n\nThe service was also sub-par. In addition for taking a long time to take our order, it also took them a long time to bring us the check. No one checked in on us to inquire about our meal or if we needed refills on drinks.\n\nI'm glad I waited so long to give Grimaldi's a try. I'm also disappointed that it was such a letdown. I don't think I'll be returning. If you want coal oven pizza, I suggest going to Lombardi's instead.
