Did not give it any thought.  I went there when I was a bit hungry during lunch time and it hit the spot. My friend had the chicken pizza and said OH MY this is SOOOOO good! This is not ray pizza, this is a thousand times, better. So,  I think it is a place that will be a safety for me. \n\nIt was not the best pizza of my life but it was good pizza. I did not actually like the selection (I just felt like they could have more variety).  Maybe if I go there again, I will try something different.  I have a feeling I will be eating there at least one more time. \n\nStaff is nice and funny. Prices are cheap. I may even try delivery.....", "author": "Loli J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-06", "description": "My neighborhood pizza. As a designer, I thought the place didn't look very inviting and it took me a while to go in there. But when I finally did - no regrets. I usually only have the cheese slice, and it is a bit on the greasy side, but I like it. Thin, simple and good. I also appreciate that the staff is super friendly and quick.", "author": "Edgygirl O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-20", "description": "ordered online. quick response. delicious, greasy food. i was in heaven.  but all in all its about what you'd expect from a decent new york pizzeria.", "author": "Ethan C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-16", "description": "I was so excited to try Not Ray's after reading so many of the reviews on yelp and other sites.

I'm not a fan of their pizza. It's not inedible, but it's bad enough that I wouldn't ever eat it again. It's also the kind of pizza that's really awful leftover. Perhaps one day I'll go back in and try something else, but for now I'm staying away.

The slices here are better than average but nowhere close to being in the same league as the elite pizza shops across New York City. But, because this is all there is in the neighborhood, Not Ray's gets very busy on weekend afternoons.
