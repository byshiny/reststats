This is actually the real Grimaldi's, with the original oven and original family owners; the other one moved next door, and is not using the right oven and just uses the Grimaldi's name it bought. I like that the tourists think the place called Grimaldi's is the actual one; let them wait online for the fake pizza. I walk right by them and go to Juliana's.\n\nThis place actually feels local and warm. The staff is nice, and the pizza is fantastic. The large is actually too big for 2 people, so get the small if on a date (they will tell you otherwise).\n\nThe pizza is worth the extra money it costs over the old Grimaldi's. And it's really nice that you don't have to wait online and can use a credit card.\n\nSince we live in DUMBO, it's good to have a place open near the waterfront that doesn't treat us like we just got off the tourist bus.\n\nOh, they need to play better music over the speakers and not forget to turn it on.", "author": "Layne B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-13", "description": "After a lot of back and forth between going to Grimaldis or Juliana's, we landed at Juliana's and we're glad we did.\n\nOnce you've made it past the enormous wait that is offset by the quick walk down to look at Manhattan across the East River and the interesting newspaper reviews of the grudge match between Grimaldis and Juliana's, you are rewarded with a lively and yet elegant atmosphere in the restaurant.  I'm not sure how the staff fits so many people in but it didn't feel overly crowded.  The focal point of the restaurant is most certainly the single coal-fired oven at the center back of the restaurant and the continual flurry of activity from the white t-shirt clad pizza artisans.\n\nThe pie was delicious.  We had a margharita and a meat-lover and both were wonderful.  The crust was perfectly crispy with a chewy edge and has a little bit of a different taste, I'm guessing from using the coal instead of wood.\n\nI would definitely recommend the trip over to DUMBO to visit Juliana's.\n\nAnd if you are ever in the Atlanta, GA area, do not miss out on Antico Pizza Napoletana.  While I really liked Juliana's pie, Anticos margharita and San Generaos pies still win in my book.  There are a few critical differences, but I think in the end it finally comes down to the taste of the sauce and on that front Anticos wins.", "author": "Eric M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "We came into Juliana's after a local told us to bypass Grimaldi's because the actual Grimaldi sold the business and later opened Juliana. This is not the best pizza I've ever had, but it was pretty dang delicious. The ingredients all tasted so fresh they were probably grown in the backyard. We ordered the Margherita. The cheese was by far amazing, and I feel like I've never had a cheese like that on a pizza. (If it was mozzarella, that'd be a really silly statement.) Even the dough was amazing! We also ordered their soup du jour and it was a white bean noodle one that I don't remember the name of. Blame it on 10 degree weather but this soup was beyond perfect. It tasted like someone's grandmother cooked it after hearing they had a miserable day. Overall, really great place! I read somewhere that they rush people out of the place, but my server was amazing, nice, and really funny. He even told me to take my time cause the weather was miserable. I'd definitely be back if I'm ever in Brooklyn again.", "author": "Amanda F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-20", "description": "Best pizza I ever had.  \n\nWe came here around New Years and were not disappointed.  The sauce. The cheese.  The toppings. Wow.  \n\nI thought I would like Chicago deep dish better but I was wrong.     Brooklyn pizza really is the best and the master himself is Patsy. \n\nGetting to meet him and chat was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.

Smaller space I suppose but definitely deserving. It's a 5 star pizza, especially the margherita. Good food, good service.

But we met a local on the way, who gave us the tip: skip Grimaldi's and head next door. We have never been more grateful. Juliana's is simply amazing. We had the classic Margherita, as this is in our view the best way to truly test a pizza place. It was outstanding. Crispy base, delicious sauce and fresh and beautiful mozzarella. We have been trying for years to find a pizza that came close to the \"best in the world\" we had in Naples. This did it, without question. For your reference, the other pizza places we tried were Lombardi's and Johns on Bleeker. Both absolute paled in comparison - in fact, there is simply no comparison. Juliana's sets the standard, and we can't wait to go back.", "author": "Pip C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-24", "description": "Sofar the best pizza.... .

So we tried our luck during the snowy weekend, and found no line and tables available immediately. Shared the meatballs to start, and two pizzas - the classic margherita with sausage, and the number 1. Both were excellent, with the margherita being a favorite. One small pizza can easily feed two people, we ended up going home with leftovers, but we did not mind. Cannoli and cheesecake for dessert - the cheesecake was excellent, but the cannoli I am not dying to have again. Looking forward to a return meal of a small pizza and cheesecake!", "author": "Wackydream M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-14", "description": "Best coal fired pizza we have had in New York!  Excellent wait staff, quick friendly service.  Located under the Brooklyn Bridge. This pizza place is owned by the original Grimaldi's owner, Patsy Grimaldi.

The server confused me with the order and I ended up with a pizza without cheese.  Again, I ordered it, so my fault.  However, they would not even let me order a new one and pay for it.

Easy: go to Juliana's, and you'll have a Patsy pizza with only a 10 mn wait (we went on a Sunday at 2pm though - it might be a little bit more crowded for dinner...)\n\nThere are 10 pizzas, 5 classic ones around 20$ (for a large one - which is meant to serve 2) and 5 specials around $28 (for the large as well). We took the Special n'1, which was delicious.\n\nThe service is very nice - the waitresses are quite busy so they are not hoovering by your table (which actually feels quite overwhelming for a European!), but they are very attentive to your every needs.
