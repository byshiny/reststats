And not like Julia Michaels but that's just as bad.\n\nBrand name advertising has done very well for this franchise, as all of the little kids think it's awesome. You're in Brooklyn for God's sake. Get your kids some proper pizza and don't let them be homogenized like the rest of the country. Wake up people.\n\nAnd yeah I ate here. Blame one of my friends in Brooklyn.

A few weeks back I brought my daughter to Target and she wanted to go here, but it was too crowded, so I owed it to her, but after a few minutes, I regretted my decision.\n\nYou walk in, you and your group will get a stamp on your wrist (it's weird because I couldn't even see the stamp, but whatever). You can then proceed to the line with the food packages (pizza or salad bar) or you can engage in free play and purchase tokens or a refillable card. \n\nIt's a bunch of games here, most of the games are only 1.8 points, which is relatively inexpensive (+1). The staff is pretty young, but they were responsive and helpful (+1). This is a cost effective place to take your kids for their birthday or merely for a leisure day out. It's a similar premise to Dave \u0026 Busters-- games provide you tickets, which you can later turn in for a prize (+1)\n\nNow, here comes the negative; what's the worst part is, it's mostly not due to the business itself, but it just destroys the fun-- the people here at this location, are the pits. I couldn't count the amount of kids I saw running wildly without a parent in site, kids misbehaving right in front of parents, who were too busy engaged in conversation to parent their minor child. Kids who play a game fifteen times in a row despite a long line of kids waiting for a game. I had a little girl steal my daughters game, that she was playing, but my daughter said it was ok, but I didn't feel it was acceptable.\n\nAnother complaint--several of the games didn't work at all, and others, just took your card swipe or coin, but you got nothing in return (-1) \n\nThis place is a notch up from Kids in Action, that place is dirty, but much more well behaved children. However, I wouldn't bring my daughter here on a regular basis, even though she enjoyed it here, I'll stick with Dave and Busters.", "author": "Jason R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-21", "description": "So much better!!

Very impressed with the attentiveness of manager and the hostess to our party. It was probably the most easiest party to organize since I booked everything online with some minor changes and questions. I couldn't get through to the outlet via telephone, but you could call the general customer care number and they will get back to you. The outlet did call me the day before the event which was great. There were enough high chairs for our party that had 3 babies. Also for parents that are wondering, they do serve beer and wine. The only thing that is a downside is the ticket counting machine. They should have something where you can put all your tickets in one machine instead of having to insert the ticket one by one. We ended up not redeeming anything cos it took way too long to count the tickets. Besides that we really had lots of fun and are very impressed with the management of this Chuck E Cheese!

The games especially. The timed game passes rock. You pay, you swipe, your kid has a ball. They had a mini basketball court that my future NBA baller only realized existed when I made him use the bathroom.#momlife. \n\nBut he had fun running around in the very spacious area, going from one cool video driving game to a fair-type shooting game to a rocking boat game that was out of order. We found a few of them displaying that majorly disappointing blinking error message. \n\nI felt a little off balance being there because I couldn't see where he was at all times. The fear! There are so many games and structures, and kids and parents and workers selling cotton candy and balloons (had to buy one for $2) and stuff that adds to the hectic experience of Chuck E Cheese. But there was tight security at the front entrance that made me feel a bit more relaxed, once we were leaving of course.\n\nThe food was OK--especially the bbq chicken wings in the family sampler. My son's pizza looked a little over done but he ate half of it and I \"encouraged\" him to eat a few of fries on my plate.  \n\nWe'll probably be back a few times or maybe every Saturday.", "author": "Michelle W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-06", "description": "Good place to bring my nephew and niece in here, they all have fun in here.\nThe reason for 4 stars is the place is dirty, they dont clean it often.

I went here on a Saturday with some friends celebrating their son's 1st birthday, which is a little too young of an age for this place, I'd say it's best for kids around 4 and up. \n\nGET TO THIS PLACE EARLY! It gets really packed on the weekends and trying to get a table was a nightmare. They offer a variety of pizza and chicken on their menu, once ordering you receive a number card for your table and your food is bought to you by a server. There's a drink station where you can get free refills, as well as a paid salad bar. You can also purchase a birthday cake here, same day. \n\nThe games were pretty decent, there were plenty to choose from like basketball and pink panther. A few of them were adapted from mobile games, like subway surfer and fruit ninja, which I suppose is a sign of the times. \n\nAn overall decent place to treat your kid to.", "author": "Ciera T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-08", "description": "Yeh, I don't understand why everyone is so damn triggered by Chuck E Cheese's.

I had to formulate a plan of action that would rightfully crown me the best cousin in all the land. I haven't been to a CHuck E Cheese in years and never to this location so I felt like a noob as I walked in with child in tow.  I was greeted by a nice young lady who asked me if I was there for a party and then asked if we were just there for the gaming or did we plan to eat as well. I was unsure so she stamped us in and informed me that all the tables were reserved. More on that later.\n\nMy little cousin walks me over to the machine that you use to put money on a plastic card so that the kids can use as currency. It was pretty affordable, $20 can get you a good amount of play time so that was a pleasant surprise.  Unfortunately to me the place looks pretty barren,there aren't that many machines or games in my opinion so it got pretty dull quickly watching my cousin look around for the next game to play and going back to the same game or having to wait her turn. The place quickly started to get packed. So the tables that are all reserved? Apparently you cant sit in their precious booths unless you are eating one of their famed pizzas. I did NOT like that, I had to stay on my feet the whole time trying not to lose my cousin in the throng of folks.This was a turn off to me so I spent my money at Buffalo Wild Wings which cost me more but a point had to be made!\n\nPros-\nAffordable\nClean Bathrooms\nThe staff here is VERY nice and pleasant. Their customer service is top notch so I commend whoever does the training. Shout out to the young lady who mans the ticket counter where the young chaps, use their tickets to buy \"prizes\", she has the patience of a Saint.\nThe stamping of the forearm they do to ensure kids aren't kidnapped is a great idea.\n\nCons-\nNot many games or activities to me.\nTicket counter machines kept breaking down", "author": "Ariel S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-12-30", "description": "If I could give this place lower I would.
