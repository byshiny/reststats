Reasonable prices, cool atmosphere with awesome music. Good service - waiter and kitchen took an allergy concern seriously (my meal came out w a plate that clearly marked allergy) - which is always appreciated.

My server was very helpful and prompt with my order. I had the sangria, which was decent. The guacamole was ok, I would have preferred more chunks of avocados (that's something I would have to request). The main course however was disappointing . I expected a better entre. I could have had a better burrito at chepolte.

We live in the neighborhood and were watching for the opening of this restaurant for many months now. The food is excellent and the service is fine. Loved the guacamole, made fresh at table side. Our entree was fresh, tasty and substantial. I would give this restaurant 5 stars, except for one major flaw: the music is way too loud. We were seated right near the speakers, so we asked to be moved. At the risk of sounding old and uncool, it was quite unpleasant to enter the restaurant and find the music blasting to the point where we had to yell to be heard. We asked if the music could be turned down. The answer was n, so the hostess moved us downstairs, where the music was slightly less loud. So, although I'd like to go back to Rocco's Taco's, I might think twice due to the excessive loudness of the music. I can't imagine folks not returning to a restaurant because the music isn't loud enough; the reverse, on the other hand, is highly likely.", "author": "Jo-Ann S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-26", "description": "I enjoyed the unlimited tacos.

Well...Brooklyn is the only one of their restaurants outside of Florida.\nFood is average but the portions are large. I was here in Spring of 2015 when they were open about 6 months. Service was between excellent and mediocre. The location and size were very comfortable.\nIf Mexican restaurants may seem like a dime for a dozen, this Rocco's Tacos \u0026 Tequila Bar has yet to be a star restaurant in Brooklyn. Someone I know recommended the place as a great spot for lunch when working in the Heights.\nI was less impressed but their Margaritas are excellent - better than those I loved at El Rio Grande on 3rd Avenue in Manhattan. Guacamole is guacamole, burritos are burritos. \nRocco's Tacos \u0026 Tequila Bar has yet to carve a unique stance in a city where Mexican restaurants are as common as Halal carts on street corners. Targeting Brooklyn from Florida means catering to a crowd that wants more but with a palate for uniqueness.", "author": "I Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-07-24", "description": "The only star this restaurant is getting is for the food. We were ID'ed at the hostess stand which seemed a bit strange, especially since my brother and I were the only patrons that we saw the security guard ID. The server was very nice, when we could find him. The appetizer came out before our drinks, and I asked for a seltzer, only to receive it after I asked a second time and it came when the entree arrived. The manager came to our table because I sent my entree back after I found a hair in my food. I used to work in the restaurant industry, so I understand that things like that happen. She offered us shots on the house which we declined because we were driving. She then offered to pay for our drinks instead. When we got the bill the drinks were still on the check and the manager was nowhere to be found. We quickly paid the check and left. I am confident that I won't be returning. Hopefully no one else has this experience.", "author": "Elizabeth D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-01", "description": "I came here to taste they food that everyone talk about, and I couldn't be happier fast service, great drinks and daily specials, I will come back with a big appetite.", "author": "Josh L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-13", "description": "Sadly the people that are handling seating shouldn't be!

Almost tastes like authentic Mexican. Server was very friendly(and cute). Took time to make suggestions and asked multiple times if we wanted anything/checked up on us. He noticed it was my birthday by looking at my ID and later came to offer me a free shot or dessert. Food is very good, expect large portions! The bathrooms here are very creepy and dark, so go with a friend if you're claustrophobic or a scaredy-cat.

Can't really comment on the food 'cause my party of 4 didn't even get a seat.  Place was pretty empty around 7pm Sunday evening.  There were three open tables that could seat a party of 4 and yet two hostesses couldn't figure out what to do.  Long story short, I could tell the staff was inept and knew the service would probably be awful.  So we left.  What a disappointment!  Also, vacuuming around the customers while they're waiting to be seated was a bit of a turnoff.
