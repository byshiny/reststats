You can order a la carte or have the buffet. It's downstairs from the Holiday Inn, so they maintain a typical continental breakfast menu to please most guests (eggs, pancakes, yogurt, etc.), although it would have been nice if they offered the Korean-French items that the restaurant serves for lunch/dinner.", "author": "Cece Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-08", "description": "Bums me out to write this, but they changed chefs and completely altered the menu.

We had two servers come to take our order and it felt like there was no communication.  It was not busy at all, but everything took forever.

This place is inside of the Holiday Inn.  The food was average at best, but the service was extremely slow, even though they only had a few patrons at the time.  When I got the check, I was billed the regular menu prices, not the $26 RW price.  I requested to have it corrected, and it took forever to get it straighten out.  This place has some potential, but needs to have much better service in order to survive.", "author": "Henry L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-12", "description": "I was unimpressed overall - they have a number of issues to sort out with respect to execution of space (massive ventilation issues), timing and pacing of dishes (absurdly too slow), and the overall dining experience. As a vegetarian, the options were somewhat limited and definitely not good enough to merit a second trip. Specifically, the tteock was a bit bland and, for the love of god, a mushroom risotto is the best vegetarian option a kitchen this creative can come up? It's neither French nor Korean nor interesting. The \"chick pea cracker\" in the heirloom tomato was literally an Indian pappadum not credited as such (and attempted to be dressed up as something fancier). That dish was good but didn't belong and masqueraded too fancy. Frankly, the fries/ketchup were probably the culinary highlight for me!\n\nAlso, this place was just radically too expensive in my view. You can do way way better in many more expensive neighborhoods than this for the price we paid. Wouldn't recommend a dinner trip out until it's fixed.", "author": "Joe S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-05-12", "description": "Giving it two stars because one of the two dishes was good- very close to only one star.\n\nCame here for brunch- only two other tables were occupied.   Sat down and waited at least ten minutes until anyone came over; there was no water at the table but there were water glasses and wine glasses.   A lot of people were working there but never really felt like we had a server.   Ordered a bloody mary and bellini- the lady that took our order than went behind bar to make drinks, she also filled our water glasses.   Another guy brought our drinks over and took our order.   And then we waited and waited and waited.   It took a good 45 minutes for food to come out.  Not once did anyone come over and ask if we needed anything ie. water glasses were empty for a bit, and brunch drinks also got light.   When food eventually came out- they did not bring my friends entree and put the fries in front of her.  We stated she also ordered something- no acknowledgement whatsoever to whether they knew that or apology or anything.   I got the bread pudding bacon and eggs which was very good!  5 minutes later they eventually brought my friends dish which was the benedict.  One of the eggs didn't even look like an egg... Again no one once asked how anything was, could they get us anything.   When they were trying to clear our plates  one of the waiters asked if I wanted another bloody mary which I might have had it been thirty minutes earlier...   \n\nPretty mediocre experience driven mainly by the awful service.", "author": "Molly G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-20", "description": "Simple Amazing ! Recently stopped by and had an amazing experience. We started off with some delicious cocktails one called Seoul Mate which used a korean yogurt and Sun also Rises that tasted like a refreshing margarita . We had the steak tartare and Truffle Tteock for appetizers and shared the Wagyu Steak that was one of the best cuts we've ever had ! Definitely worth stopping by can't wait to come back .", "author": "Jay P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-27", "description": "Good food and very friendly waiters.

I think it's more French styled with an undertone of Korean influence but loved the flavors overall. It was a soft opening so they treated us to a complimentary champagne in the beginning, which was a cherry on top. Our favorite was the oysters with pork belly and kimchi, and truffle ttuokboggi (genius how he thought of this!!!) as well as bone marrow/tomatoes. We had duck cofit for entree, which was great but thought it could use more flavor. Each dish had such a great mix of flavor and I'm so glad we have a restaurant like this in the neighborhood. We also had the blueberry compote and passion fruit ice cream for dessert and they also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with it. Being Korean myself, I loved how he creatively used Korean flavors for French dishes. At the end, the chef came by and even chatted with us which made the whole experience so personal! We love this restaurant and will def be returning for brunch or another dinner. There's \"soul\" to the flavors of his food and you can feel that the chef cares about every dish and is passionate about what he does. Five stars for impeccable service and delicious food!!

Went for lunch and there was only one other table in there and he seemed to be on his computer the whole time and I think maybe staying at the hotel. The service was non-existent, the food extremely average and the work they were doing added a lot of hammering and sawing sounds in addition to the smell of smoldering wood that was coming from all the sawing. There are a ton of great places in this area now. If this place doesn't change, and fast, it will be nothing more than a breakfast bar for the hotel guests.", "author": "Mike Y."}], "servesCuisine": "French", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Brasserie S\u00e9oul", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "300 Schermerhorn St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/K_En4RdIwU-pHslC0fg3NQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17183301099"}
