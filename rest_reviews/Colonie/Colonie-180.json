I didn't mind because it's pretty cool to see the system of setting up plates. \n\nThe layout was odd since we were far from each other, and the waitstaff had to awkwardly get close to us to hear anything since the loud hip hop music was blasting. Not brunch music and not at 11 in the morning. Lower the music. \n\nI ordered the Cool Hand Cuke after ready countless reviews saying this was the best cocktail. Maybe it's my palate but this cocktail was not great. For $12 about 1/3 of the glass was empty, I tasted no mint what so ever, and it basically tasted like bad pickle juice. I was disappointed. \n\nNow onto the food. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the duck hash and I was quite impressed. Every element on his plate worked in harmony. My mother-in-law was not very pleased with her eggs benedict. She said the poached egg was undercooked and the hollendaise was thin and weak. We ordered the donuts and the one I had was good. Peanut butter mousse inside a freshly fried donut? Yeah, they were good. The biscuits were also very good. Now my entree was a complete bust. I ordered the shrimp and grits. I also added the fried egg for an extra $3. The grits tasted pretty good but were cold. The mushrooms that topped the grits were chewy and spongelike. The shrimp were a serious issue. I'm all about paying for good food and I don't mind if a place is a little more expensive as long as the food is worth it, but this meal wasn't. 2 of my shrimp were overcooked while 2 were undercooked. Out of the ones I received 1 wasn't deveined. Are you kidding me? I could barely eat anything on my plate and it was almost $20. What a waste. The fried egg was overcooked and rubbery on the bottom and the whites were barely set on top. My dish was mostly a bust. \n\nThe kitchen moved quickly but I would have much rather waited for hot, cleaned, well cooked food.", "author": "Shira F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-29", "description": "This was one of the most delicious, subtle, interesting, attentive meals I've ever had!\n\nHighly recommend.\n\nWe had:\n1. the oysters (so fresh and the light sauce they come with was perfectly prepared),\n\n2. the ricotta and honey crostini (perfectly prepared, the honey was just subtle enough to enhance the flavor of the ricotta, but not overwhelm),\n\n3. the leeks with almonds (I was worry about the almond part of this dish, but they were whole, not sliced, and perfectly seasoned, the leeks were soft and juicy and flavorful)\n\n4. the scallops, oh the scallops, those big fat juicy slightly toasted on the outside, and perfectly delicate and soft, but cooked on the inside ... if you are a scallop-chaser, such as myself, you must eat here. And the sauce and baby carrots were incredible.\n\n5. date cake with cream fraiche ice-cream (you would never believe this was date-cake. I didn't expect to like it, and ended up loving it).\n\nScore for individual French-press coffee!!\n\nThe plant wall and overall decor may have contributed to my LOVING the food. \n\nThe Hostest is incredibly knowledgeable on the wine list, ask her to assist in ordering!!\n\nI can't wait to eat here again ...", "author": "Frances G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-16", "description": "Awesome restaurant with an energetic atmosphere. Went here for bunch and sat up at the bar that was overlooking the open kitchen which made for a really entertaining experience. Ordered the duck ragu and the eggs with leeks and gruyere.

The bloody Mary's were one of the best Ive had, I really enjoyed the one with clam juice as well.  The food was also very good.  The only thing is they don't take reservations so be prepared to wait if you go during the weekend like I did.

Peter D. summed it up pretty good: \"Colonie does everything right. Sort of.\"\n\nI want to like you. I really do. We've been a number of times, but it's just not taking.\nThe main reason: there's no love.\n\nLet's say we sit at the kitchen bar and enjoy the view of the kitchen staff. Let's say they flip some water or something onto my wife's plate, napkins, placemat. Oh, and let's say we both go, \"Hey!\"\nWe realize you are a chef and working, but you also have people with money sitting there who pay your salary and you just slapped water on us, so you need to actually acknowledge that. There isn't a magic forcefield there. We know you can see us.\n\nOr how about a waiter that lets wine glasses stay empty way too long? We watch him chatting with the staff across the restaurant.\n\nWhat kind of oysters are these? No one tells us? Odd.\n\nThen there's the food in general. It looks nice and is put together lovely, but apart from the date cake for dessert, it's pretty unremarkable. Granted, it would be great if I could give them constructive criticism, but I can't remember anything from our last meal there (a mere 6 days ago I think) apart from an egg salad crostini (nice) and the oysters and the date cake.\n\nThis sounds a bit too cranky.

However, I really couldn't stand a business that doesn't care about customers' dietary preference. I ordered a duck hash and it comes with a poached egg. I explained to the server that I'm pregnant and preferred my egg to be fully cooked instead of runny. She did explain that there will be extra charge of altering the menu. But come on, honestly, most restaurants would be willing to accommodate this kind of simple request. It turned out the extra charge was $3 more to turn a poached egg into a fried one. It was really frown upon. It's like, \"oh you have nut allergy, I need to charge you $3 for taking off the nuts on your salad because you are altering our menu!!!\" For that kind business model, I won't go back no matter how good your food is.", "author": "Linda C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "Colonie, I did you no favors by not telling you how nice your staff and service people were to me and my wife last night. You were attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable about the food. Our waiter was thoughtful about his suggestions on the menu, the wine list and even the beer. Your food was outstanding, well presented, and with just the right amount of timing between dishes --FYI, your pasta selections, fab. To say nothing of your ambience is to betray your restaurant. Your rear room is cozy, warm and energetic. Crowded house last night! The touches of brick combined with a modernist, country aesthetic are hard to pull off, but you did it. I dined with you a few years ago and I am glad I stopped in again. Your chef and staff are still on top of their game.
