The staff was not very welcoming which I can understand when it's busy. I informed if they served oat-milk. A question I regretted right away. The girl behind the bar was very snappy. Anyway. I was ordered a almond matcha latte. In now way the beverage met my expectations. The powder wasn't wel mixed and my drink was full of gravel. I literally needed tot gag when I drunk it. Now I know how  a tea of \"Roland Garros tennis field\" taste like. \n\nI can't say anything bad about the interior. It was kind of dark. Which I liked very much. It had a very nice fall feel. So I'm sure this was a one time bad experience.

Those were heavenly. Unfortunately that baker is no longer here. So our scones are different now... Those were a different level\".  \n\nI concur. \n\nI ordered an egg muffin (asparagus, 1 mushroom, almond meal, feta). It was horrific. Wayyyy too salty. It was the only flavor that I could taste. \n\nThe only good thing about the new spot is that it provides people with laptops a place to squat for hours. \n\nTheir food has nosedived into mediocrity.

Downside is some seats are pretty cramped and your WiFi expires in one hour until you make another purchase. They have good coffee and also a couple of vegan baked good options.

Include a musical sketch, spoofing \"Talk Dirty to Me,\" called \"Talk Nerdy to Me\"? A catchy idea. But a quick Google search, on the wifi supplied on a slip of paper when you make a purchase, showed that a group had already spoofed it in Star Trek costumes, plus a Huffington Post science podcast had taken the title as well, and t-shirts were everywhere.

The tea selection is ok- about 5 greens, blacks, and herbals (nothing too fancy or inspiring).

The cafe is quite spacious and there are lots of tables to work at. They have a nice no-laptop area and great sofa seats right next to wide windows. I stayed at a large table to work (ended up staying like three hours!), and it was a very enjoyable experience over all. There are two bathrooms that are quite clean and a water dispenser as well.\n\nI docked a star because of the food I ordered. I got a cup of hot chocolate and a buttermilk biscuit - the buttermilk biscuit was tasty, but the hot chocolate tasted a bit diluted and the cocoa powder sank to the bottom. \n\nOverall a great, cozy cafe!", "author": "Ellen F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-06", "description": "The best coffeeshop for getting work done or people-watching in this whole swath of Brooklyn-- and that's coming from someone who's willing to go far out of his way.\n\nFood all the time, beer and wine at night.

Ample seating but yet still feels cozy and warm.  Love the decor and multiple seating areas (i.e. front lounge area, by the bar, dining section with no laptops allowed and communal picnic tables).  Good selection of drinks (non/caffeinated and alcoholic) available.  Food and snack is on the pricey side but likely priced for those to stay 1/2 the day using their laptops and charging station.

When I went there this morning they only had a cauliflower egg muffin that was a bit strange. I didn't like the cauliflower in it. There was no sweet pastry option (muffin or other) available, which is what I really wanted and what makes the most sense for a coffee shop. My favorite cafes have a range of options that are gluten free but appeal to everyone since the quality and flavor of their cookies or muffins is so good.\n\nI have been a longtime customer of their sister businesses: Provisions and Greene Grape, where I have been pleased with their service and products.  I have enjoyed coffee here for a long time, and it is very good. \n\nI hope that they will improve their options!", "author": "Lucy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-30", "description": "I really just dropped in to see if anyone reviewed the most amazing breakfast sandwich! Which, I don't believe anyone has. So... I love this place. It's got spots to sit and work, and it's got a super friendly staff. But really, hands down, my favorite breakfast sandwich. I know that the ingredients come from the local Greene Grape Provisions market, and they're always fresh and delicious. The sandwich is on a hearty english muffin, has egg + bacon, but really the scallion tomato jam and the siracha mayo make this thing. It's really just so delicious. I want it for every meal of the day (but that's a bad idea). It also comes in a veggie option. But I love bacon.\n\nThe bacon egg cheese hand-pie is also super tasty. \n\nCoffee is great. I prefer the hot to the cold brew, personally. \n\nSolid go-to in Fort Greene for a quick coffee/breakfast/email break.", "author": "Katie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-05", "description": "I like the concept of a laid back bar table (NOT a dive bar) coming together with ample pastry options, good sandwiches, and decent coffee. There are a handful of cafes doing this already, which is still a rare sight in New York, but the fact that this one is in Fort Greene (four subway stops away from me) means that there is absolutely no excuse for me to miss out.\n\nI didn't go to the bar so I'm not sure about the bar lady, but the guys serving coffee was pretty darn chill - I even tipped, which I never does at cafes, considering their good attitude and how long I'm gonna sit my butt on one of their tables, camping out with my laptop.\n\nThe cafe au lait (my staple order) was nice - good texture, and enough milk that I know they didn't mess it up with lattes. You wouldn't believe how many cafes make mistakes like this. My cinnamon donut was meant to temporarily quench my hunger, but I came to like it a lot! It is sugary, but unlike your typical glazed donuts, it won't leave you feeling guilty about yourself for rest of the day.\n\n30 minutes of WiFi is on them, which is a pretty good gesture since so many cafes don't even make internet an option anymore. I feel a little bad that after the time limit I immediately switched toward my cell phone hotspot, since I heard buying an access code isn't that bad either.\n\nIf I lived closer to Fort Greene, I would've made this place my home.
