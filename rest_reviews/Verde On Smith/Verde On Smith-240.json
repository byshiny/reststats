I am writing this review to counter the one star review that was  written by someone who accused the owner of being discourteous.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Cono is a gentleman. I  have witnessed him treat all who enter the door with the utmost respect. I love this restaurant and have dined here numerous times.

I had made a reservation online and was running late, so I called ahead to push the reservation a half hour and was told that would be fine. Upon arriving, my partner and I waited for a half hour to be seated, were told repeatedly it was our fault for showing up late (despite having called ahead and been told it was fine). We were then told 'sorry for the wait' (but it was our fault) and we'd be 'taken care of.'\nUpon being seated, we were told that we were too late for the brunch special (we would not have been late had we been seated within 15 min. of our revised reservation).\nWhen we inquired as to whether an exception could be made based on our service to that point, the older man who seated us began to explain again that we were too late and couldn't get a reduced price because they had to prepare for dinner?\nHe finally conceded to extend brunch 30 minutes for us, but only after slamming his hands down on the table (we were fairly quiet and polite), at which point we opted to just skip brunch altogether, since the hour was getting late.\n\nCustomer service =/= explaining to the customer how wrong they are.", "author": "Michael K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "description": "Came here like 2 weeks ago for my sisters graduation, the menu looked ok, I wasn't really impressed with the menu items. Then the waiter came and told us the specials. As appetizers we got an eggplant lasagna and stuffed mushrooms they were both great. My meal I ordered shrimp, lobster and scallops al Diablo I wasn't too fond of it. It was ok, my sister raved about her stuffed chicken, my nieces ordered something simple like Cesar salad with grilled chicken, and the chicken was amazing tasted really fresh. My boyfriend had a coconut martini and it was so delicious, and me and my sister had a lychee martini also very good. I liked the drinks better then the food honestly.

The owner/manager is a brute. Not even a smile! Not even a simple welcome to VERdE ! Not even a be with you in a moment; Just my party and I standing at the entrance as if we were a prop or invisible to say the least . My friends and I have been patrons for over a year and we have let the condescending service slide but this subtle discrimination is unacceptable in my hometown. The management Verde on Smith needs to learn how to serve their clients from the time they set foot into the establishment. Granted, we have enjoyed great service from some of the staff but the management there is so curt and abrupt! The owner/manger said that seating would take 45 minutes, however another worker said 20 minutes, less than 5 minutes before. As he said this, a group stood up to leave. When I inquired about the open table and he said he was expecting a large group... Really? At 3:10 pm when brunch ends at 3:30! He said that only outside seating was available for our party of three. This was all said in a disgusted impersonal manner. He then added as an after thought that unlimited drinks had already ended, as if This was enough to send us out the door with no return. We went across the street to Chance, where we were immediately welcomed. I bumped into a friend of mine that said he received similar treatment over the past week that he has frequented the establishment. If you are a person of color be advised.\n\nYour Comment (Cono M. of Verde on Smith \nBusiness Owner) 5/4/2014- \"How much malice and bad faith in this review\",\nFurther shows that you do not care for your customers.

Fast forward we make it 15 mins late for the reservation and the hostess told us they still had a table reserved for us. We were then greeted by our waiter who didn't introduce himself he immediately took our drink order.. We ordered the steak and eggs with French toast to share . Super yum until my beau found a hair in his potatoes...bummer. Our waiter never came back to check on us after he put the order in. Luckily another near by waiter was promptly servicing us keeping the drinks flowing...score. The Decor was very  Victorian which I liked. It also has a outdoor seating area.

I was appalled at my most recent experience there. I made a reservation for brunch for three people. Unfortunately, we hit traffic and were running no more than 10 minutes late. Out of consideration I called ahead to let the host/owner know of the situation and was told rudely that he could not hold the reservation. Then I was told to come and if there was a table, he would seat us. So being that I'm 8 months pregnant and hungry, my friends and I decided to take our chances. When we arrived, not only was the host/owner rude again, he wanted us to sit in the freezing cold outside. When I asked how long it would be for a indoor seat, he refused to tell me. What kind of restaurant owner turns away patrons who had a reservation and a pregnant woman???", "author": "Nadine H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-11-16", "description": "I am basing my review on the service because the food was actually very good. However, the service was mediocre to say the least.  It was three of us and for some reason they had to take ONE chair away from the table to make it a 3 person table even though it s 4 top table. They did it to another customer as well and he was perplexed.  So me and my girlfriends tried to somehow understand why they were doing this but the owner explain they were very busy - hello I am looking around there were only 4 tables being serviced how are you busy right now. Anyways, moving on - here comes our lovely attitude fill waiter who for some reason the owner defended when he should have been corrected. We told him we couldn't understand why they couldn't move us to another table - he proceeded to make a joke that was NOT funny saying \"well what is the problem I can give you the other table and switch and it still be the same table\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I told him - well it seems he doesn't care about his tip.  He had an attitude and his name was Luis. They was absolutely nothing pleasant about him - I would have rather have one of the other serves which were REALLY nice. One of them brought us our drinks and he practically pushed him out to take the drinks from him. He was rude and didn't have any customer service skills whatsoever. As a owner you should be able to correct your employees not let them act however they want - your business is a representation of yourself and since you approve of him as a waiter you lost and will loose plenty of customers.  I do not recommend this place and will not go back.", "author": "Michelle Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-16", "description": "I'd give this place a 3.5 - good positive experience but not my favorite.\n\nVerde on Smith serves Italian/Seafood cuisine. My dinner party of 4 arrived at 6:15pm on a Saturday night. The service was a little slow but it was nice not to feel rushed out of the restaurant.\n\nThey have an awesome cocktail and wine list but a pretty lousy beer menu. I was surprised to find a restaurant in BK that doesn't serve multiple craft beers - only Peroni, Stella, Hoegarden, and BK Brew.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nAppetizers:\nBaked Clams - Exactly as expected. Delicious.\nSeafood Salad - Not a fan of cold seafood dishes. The squid was mediocre.\nPortobello Mushroom w/ Feta - Amazing. The portobello mushroom was sliced and had an amazing meaty texture.\n\nDinner:\nLamb Shank - Not too big, not too small.

Since I tried a place nearby I figured why not give this a shot. Mistake. I really didn't enjoy what Verde offered and the price to food execution ratio is way off. Meaning I shouldn't be paying so much that doesn't taste great. Here's the scoop:\n\nPotato cakes with creme fraiche: the discs were too hard, possibly from leaving in the deep dryer too long\nBaked eggs with leeks: I felt like I was bringing on a heart attack for myself by eating this. Basically eggs in a little pot of oil and cheese. I tried just picking out the eggs with as little oil as possible but that was unsuccessful. It was not pleasant eating such fattening eggs and I'm all about eggs!\nHalf burger of some kind: Can't even remember the name so you can tell how \"great\" this was. I can only recall it was very dry and small in size. \n\nBill came up to be $42 with tip. Kinda pricy for those dishes if you really think about it. I couldn't believe I suggested to come here; I'm so embarrassed.

It was pretty late so it wasn't too busy and so nice to be in a quiet restaurant, with good acoustics and an awesome play list.\n\nStarted with some wine and baked clams.  The clams took awhile to come which I prefer since you know they are not pre made.
