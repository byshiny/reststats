SO MANY DELISH THINGS! They've got everything - literally every kind of dessert you could imagine, there's no use in listing them. We got the canollis - they've got a big size and smaller size too. Unfortunately they don't have many flavors, but what they do have is mouth watering. My only gripe with this place is that it isn't right underneath where I live. Then again... that may be a bad thing...", "author": "Priti R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-08", "description": "Really upset with this bakery! Me and my boyfriend came here, they seated us and brought us water and for 15 minutes no one came up to us to take our order. We finally get up and just order ourselves  another 15 mins pass no one brings us anything, apparently there was no waitress to bring us our dessert. Really disappointed dessert looked great but 0 service   We left no one said anything.", "author": "Victoria G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-30", "description": "Best chocolate fudge cake around.

It really is. I also have heard raving reviews about this place. My friend that lives next to it can't stop talking about it so I decided to try it. First time I had the chocolate cake and it was good. She wanted the cannoli (I'm weird and not a fan of cannolis). I then went again with my fiance and we ordered a bunch of stuff. Black and white cookie (too dense), marshmellow bread pudding (not good at all), oreo cake pop (just fine), and tres leches cupcake (ok). So needless to say, I was a bit overwhelmed. Maybe I didn't order the right things. Again, their selection is phenomenal so maybe I\"ll give it another shot.", "author": "Heather S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-07", "description": "Everything was delicious.

The amazing team at Mia's Bakery made our wedding cake and did a spectacular job.  I asked for a cake that very few bakeries will make (trust me I've asked dozens of bakeries all over Brooklyn and Manhattan!) 3-tier white cake with buttercream, a layer of mocha, and a layer of apricot jam!  Their cake is light and fluffy and the buttercream is not too dense and salty/buttery and the cake was STUNNING To look at and delicious. Plus they worked with me on 2 trial cakes to make sure it would be perfect.  They also came in under budget!

My husband brought home a Nutella cupcake and tasted so good that I had to visit this place myself.  My first time visiting, I ordered the chocolate peanut butter cake it was super moist and tasted so good.

The showcase is like 30 feet long stuffed with various sweet treats like cupcakes, cakes and cookies in at least a half dozen flavors.\nI choose Red Velvet Cheesecake daughter had creme burlee and wife has chocolate layer cake. It was so rich and creamy they should have couches to nap after conquering the cake.\nSpace is quite large and has outdoor garden too. Prices reasonable and will be back for sure.", "author": "Rich M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-27", "description": "Another amazing experience at Mia's.The food was great.Special thanks to waitress Lena,for making our night special!!!", "author": "Yuliya S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-02", "description": "The pastries are really, REALLY good! Cakes and pies are also delicious. So why 4 stars and not 5?

I did some research online for some bakeries that sell pies and found that too many required 48 or more hours in advance AND charged 40.00 a pie which is crazy! I found Mia's website while browsing online and was able to order the pies on their website (less than 24 hours ahead of when I needed to pick them up) and wound up getting 2 for the price of what I would have been charged for one elsewhere. I swung by to pick them up and was in and out in less than 10 minutes.

Once we stopped by on a Saturday and enjoyed desserts in house, and I recently ordered a cake for my fianc\u00e9s birthday as a surprise. Both times Mia's really delivered!\nThe first time we shared an eclair and Mille-feuille. Both were a delight. Light, airy, and not overly rich. Perfect treats that didn't totally ruin our appetites for the rest of the day. \nThe coconut cake I ordered was a crowd pleaser, amongst people that didn't even like coconut. I ordered an 8 inch for 5 people and we demolished it. I seriously couldn't stop eating it. The leftovers were calling my name all day and literally every time I passed the fridge I snuck a bite. It was perfect. I didn't think I was a fan of whipped cream as frosting, but it was AMAZING. It made it such that the cake was indulgent but not sickeningly so like buttercream can be. This was a blessing and a curse, as it made it easier to just devour. \nWe were so impressed we're looking into ordering a wedding cake from Mia's next spring.
