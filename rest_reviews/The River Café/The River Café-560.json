Rude pretentious Maitre De, who suggested that I was \"inappropriately\" dressed to sit in the window???.  Smart casual was the code. So I wore designer jeans and a t shirt. Not really sure if it was the shirt or my tattoos that offended him.  Either way it was the quickest and worst experience I have had at any restaurant worldwide.  2 days ago we ate at Le Bernardin (3 michelin stars) and have Per Se and 11 Madison Park to go and I'm sure they will be more accommodating than that smuck.

I've been here for brunch (make sure you get the Brooklyn Bridge dessert!) and dinner, and it looks completely different (I'd recommend going for dinner). In the evening, you can take pictures in front of the restaurant where the landscape is beautiful with your family or significant other and the view of the bridge if breathe taking.

It's a lovely, elegant venue with a stunning view. And yes, it's expensive. I have to say I'm not a fancy-food kind of gal. I don't want or need caviar or foie gras (in fact I had to just check to make sure I spelled \"foie gras\" right, because I care so little for it). So that's what really keeps me from giving the River Cafe 5 stars -- I find some of the menu too pretentious. But the ambiance is fantastic, and the menu we picked for our rehearsal dinner was a big hit. You can also always win me over with decadent desserts, and The River Cafe sure knows how to do that. I about fainted with delight from our chocolaty dream of a dessert.\n\nThe staff was very polite and helpful. When one of our guests revealed that she didn't eat fish or red meat (which were our two entree selections, of course -- doh!), the staff was very understanding and prepared a special dish just for her, a dish that she loved. They were also very nice in dealing with one of our other guests, who seemed to complain about every other thing (unnecessarily so, I might add) -- from the to the temp of the room (no one else had a problem with it), to wondering why he couldn't get a special dish too, to the fact that they were serving red wine with the meat and he wanted the same white wine he'd had with the fish. (He was certainly having enough WHINE with his dinner, let me tell you...) The staff was excellent and highly professional in dealing with him, whereas I personally was about to throw him over the pier's edge.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend The River Cafe for special events. They helped make our rehearsal dinner a success and a night to remember fondly. I wish it wasn't so expensive and that their food was a little less highfalutin, but the view and service can't be beat.

The restaurant itself could use updating but the view was beautiful. The service was great. The price is higher then it should be and honestly they need to freshen up their menu, no one wants to go out to eat and have an amish chicken...\nMy husband had the steak (excellent), I had the lobster and lobster (ehh).

I agree. But add cute waiters to what I described above and the amazing food and wines...and voila, you've got quite a memorable experience. And the view -- WOW.\n\nSo, I went to River Cafe as part of a huge group. I was expecting some of their legendary quality to go down -- because after all, how perfect can you cook 70 filets mignon at once? Well, they've got it down to a science because everyone loved their meals. And because the group paid, I don't know how much my particular meal/wines cost....but whatever it was I'm sure it was worth it! \n\nIf i were to offer a tiny criticism, it would be the temperature. I think I had the one seat in the outdoor [closed] tent that had a cold vent right on her face....but oh well. It didn't break my experience in any way. In fact when I complained to the waiter he offered to turn it off. I declined because I didn't want everyone else to suffer in the heat, but I thought it was a nice touch.\n\nEveryone -- enjoy.", "author": "Flavia A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-08", "description": "Great place, really lovely.

We both ordered the prix fixe menu and ordered an extra appetizer of oysters.  His scallop app was delicious, while my mackerel was decent, and the oysters were as expected. For our entrees, we had ordered the lamb and the duck, both medium rare.  His came out perfectly tender and juicy, while my duck came out almost well done and chewy, which was very surprising.  It seems like the restaurant has a tendency to overcook the meat.  I had to return mine, and the next one came out better, but still wasn't fantastic like the lamb.  I have definitely had much better duck at other restaurants.  For dessert, we ordered the pistachio semifreddo and the key lime souffle.  The semifreddo was really good, but the accompaniments were both too tart and sweet as was the souffle.  The views of the restaurant were beautiful of course, and it was cool to see the boats passing by.

Walking out extremely disappointed is putting it mildly for what we experienced. I was aware before walking in that this venue has a reputation of being pretentious and rude.  Well, I would say they 100% back up these accusations. This is going to be a long one!\n \nThis all started off great!  The planning stage was fine, the private events coordinator being easy to work with and such.  We mentioned we wanted a DJ and their usual DJ contacted us right away. \n \nI arrived about 20-30 mins prior to my event to set up the seating cards and to make sure everything was set up according to plan.  Everything was pretty much perfect and the waiters and waitresses were helpful in making sure I was happy with everything thus far.\n \nHere is were it starts to go down hill.  Guests arrive and we are having our cocktail hour.  I am approached by one of the waiters giving me a heads up to start having our guests take their seats.  I ask for a few more minutes since we had guests still arriving.  Not even a minute later, I am chatting with my boss and was approached again.  Both myself and my boss ask again for a few more minutes for a few people to get settled.  Without warning, they being telling our guests to sit down.  I did not give the ok for anyone to begin doing that.  It was embarrassing and very rude.\n \nMoving on to the main event..dinner.   A number of my guests were disappointed in quality and serving size.  For the money that was spent, I was expecting top notch and what we received was something I could have paid a lot less for in a place where we would have been treated a lot nicer.\n \nHere is the real kicker!  According to the contract the party was to end at 11:30PM.  Also mentioned in that same contract was the option to extend the party and the pricing was listed for each allotment of time.  We are in the middle of dancing and enjoying the music when all of a sudden everything just stops.  I look over and the DJ left his table.  It looked like he set the last song and disappeared.  They begin to shut the lights on the terrace outside of the private room.  Then they begin to take the patio umbrellas in!!  I look at the time and it is 11:30PM.  My boss and I were so upset.  No one had even approached us to ask if we would like to extend the party.  Everything was just ended so abruptly it was mortifying.  Everyone was looking around and asking what was going on.  We were being rushed out!!  I ask for the bill and my boss asks if all parties here end so abruptly.  His answer was \"well 11:30PM was your end time and no one expressed they wanted to extend\"  My boss's reply was \"Well we were never even asked, we were in the middle of dancing and things just shut down\"  No one was sitting on their watches, we were enjoying the party!!  I have hosted events at other venues where I was approach about 15-20mins prior to the expected end time and I WAS ASKED if I wanted to extend since people were enjoying themselves.\n \nOne of waiters then proceeds to announce in the middle of the room to please proceed to the front if anyone needs a cab.  I mentioned my car was valeted and he took my ticket before I even had a chance to get my coat.  We had people visiting from as far as Dallas, TX and I felt terrible that this was what they traveled for.\n \nThen to end our night I finally make my wobbly way in heels down the cobble stone walk way to get my car to see it drive down past me way down the driveway, what was the point of even valeting when I have to go chase my car down their driveway.  I am assuming they did this because they were allowing cabs to come in and I am almost hit by one trying to get to my car.  You have a bunch of valets with vests and walkie talkies directing traffic but yet it was still a mess. I then received more attitude when I approach the valet for my keys.

The place says that 6-8 people propose there a week so you know if has to be good.\n\nThe Food: Very impressed with the use of flavors.  Ceviche with cilantro sorbet, very delish and unique.  Highly recommend the tasting menu.  Foie gras two ways was also very good.  We requested it on the tasting menu because I had read so many good things about it and it did not disappoint.\n\nThe Crowd: Jackets are required and most people wear suits either with or without a tie.  I wore a jacket with nice jeans.  Definitely wear a collared shirt.  FYI do not wear ripped or torn jeans if you are going to go that route.  The crowd is a bit older, like 45 plus.  Lots of people celebrating birthdays.\n\nThe View/Setting: Views are amazing, best in NYC.  Right on the water, literally.  You can watch the sunset as you are eating, pretty cool.  Outside the trees are lined with lights which makes for a very romantic setting at night. \n \nThe Price: We did the six course tasting menu for $125 a person and had quite a bit of wine including a bottle for $100.

Overall the flavorings were bland and although the presentation was fine, they didn't 'pop' nearly as much as the fireworks that took place outside. Our main courses consisted of the Rack of Lamb, the Duck Breast and the Lobster Wellington and again, everything was presented nicely, but everything lacked the pizzaz of a kitchen trying to find something to entice with.
