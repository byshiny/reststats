Casual setting, family friendly restaurant with a bar. Wasn't too hungry so I decided to split an order of nachos with my cousin. The $11 nachos was an $11 cold mess. $11 of disappointment. It seemed as if the nachos were made first, sat on the kitchen counter until the rest of my group's food finished and was brought out all at once. The unattractive dish was placed in front of us. From the cold cheddar cheese, tortilla chips in a combination of both stale and soggy, poor distribution of the beef, to the thin layer of salsa or pico de gallo (couldn't identify)...should have ordered the protein burger. I watched my co-worker enjoy it. Another thing, the hyper waiters would constantly bug us by refilling our waters, even immediately after I took my first sip. I wish my first experience at two eight two was as exciting as people recommended.", "author": "Anthony S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-26", "description": "Well that was fast. Place used to be good when it first opened now it is gross. True the burger and fries are OK but everything else on the menu is disgusting. Onion rings were freezer burned and the milkshake was so sugary I couldn't even take a second sip.\n\nAlso it is just dirty. The tables, if you dare to peek in the kitchen and bathrooms.

Visiting from out of town and saw good reviews, lets just say they did not even hit any expectations. We had the worst server ever, we had a better connection with the busser. Ordered burgers and one of my family members asked for a medium well and it turned out to be rare. We waited and waited and our server never came to check on our meal so we flagged down a host and had him remake it, by the time she got it we were all finished and her burger was missing half the egg. Very disappointed.\n\nBesides the service, the burgers were very small and did not offer the best flavor.

Love the boozy milkshakes - made with rum or bourbon. The are great, especially with cheese on them.

This, with the place at maybe half capacity. Well, folks, the answer is around 45 minutes. Which makes absolutely no sense in a restaurant with under a dozen items, all of them being burgers or hot dogs. And the place wasn't even half full. So that was our last time there.\n\nWe were there prior but we never got to try the food. Even though it was full, after an hour and a half of not getting our food and politely alerting our waiter that we needed to be out in an hour and a half from start to finish, we left. In all that time, we never got our food. The waiter was barely apologetic. Like this happens frequently and he just didn't care.\n\nBut we did go back when we had hours to spare and as you read above, it took forever. The table next to us waited 45 minutes for their party of four. Our party of two? Over an hour. Which I could forgive if the burger was the equivalent of manna from heaven. Of course, it wasn't. It wasn't awful but even in my ravenous state, when everything tastes awesome, I was left unimpressed. It was nothing special. Totally forgettable.\n\nAll the high ratings? I'm guessing it's the emperor has no clothes syndrome.

The burger can be a bit bigger for the price considering it's an al a carte menu.

The lamb burger was good but not great and the Greek fries weren't the best I've ever had. Not sure why this place is rated so highly it reminded me of Johnny Rockets but without the kick ass milkshakes.", "author": "Brittany R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-15", "description": "After work, a friend decided to take me for a \"great burger spot\" as he would describe it. It was my first time so I was excitied when I saw the layout of the place. It has a seating area in the front, a bar then indoor back seating and an outside patio area. It was getting cold as the night went on so I figured we could sit in the middle. However the hostess told us that it was a four seater and because it was only two of us we would have to sit near the back door where people would be coming in and out from the patio area and still be freezing. The place was half empty and so I couldn't understand why we weren't able to sit there, especially if the table wasn't reserved. Then he moved us to the front window seating and near the OPEN ENTRANCE DOOR to have a seat!! He then told us to seat on opposites sides of one another so there could be more room for others. Again... There were barely people in the restaurant. I put up a fight to sit side by side because I like my space plus it was warmer that way. The hostess handed us menus and walked away. We waited for about 10mins for a waitress or server or something!! No one showed so I got up to walk to the back to ask the hostess was he taking our order and he said he would call our waiter. Our \"waiter\" ended up being the sole bartender behind the bar who was making drinks for a couple. He asked our order and I told him I didn't want to shout it across the room, and I didn't think it was far i hand to stand up and walk to my waiter. So my friend told him what I wanted and guess what... I had to shout it across the room just to confirm it with the bartender/waiter.  The food arrived promptly. the two8two burger was nice, the sweet potato fries froze over before I could finish them. The drinks are high priced and very weak, you get more ice than alcohol. It even took them an even longer time to bring the bill. I had to walk over to the hostess once more and hand him my card. The bill came up to about $80 for one order of nachos, one burger w. fries and two drinks. I could have went to BBQ's  or Buffalo Wing Wild Wings and had better food, a more comfortable seating and stronger drinks that are worth the price. My suggestion, if you walk pass this place.

I get that the name makes it easy to remember the address, but the Bar and Burger part was discouraging, I'm mostly not a burger kind of girl. I finally went though, because it was one of the locations listed on the NYC Good Whiskey Passport, and I was very pleasantly surprised. \nI just went with my husband for drinks, so I can't speak to the food here. The bar was large and surprisingly elegant, with a large selection of liquors on display, and their prices were great for the offerings. My husband got the $5 pilsner that was the night's happy hour special, which he liked, and I ordered an old-fashioned to test the whiskey skills. BTW, you could choose ANY whiskey you wanted if you wanted to do a 1-ounce neat, which I thought was really nice.  And I was really impressed by how much time and effort the friendly bartender put into making my drink, which tasted great. And they don't go the usual super-saccharine maraschino cherries in their drinks either, the two I got in mine were delicious!
