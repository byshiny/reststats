It's like without Sibte at the grill everything felt off. I honestly don't think I will be back at this location. Only thing that was actually Better then Bushwick location is the Masala Fries. The Jani burger was soggy and the lamb chops had a weird aftertaste. I've never experienced this at the Bushwick location in the many years I've been patronizing that location. If that's a 9.5 then this was a 7.5 rating. Honestly food was three and half stars but the staff was super nice so four stars. Moral of the story Go to the Bushwick location!", "author": "Soupmaster Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-24", "description": "we ordered the lamb tikka with mixed veggies which according to the menu comes with paratha. We were told it would take 10 minutes and we ended up waiting 25 minutes. We didn't check the order on the spot because we were so anxious to get out of there after waiting that long for something that is supposed to be fast food. We came home and not only the lamb was not cooked (to a point that we thought eating it might get us sick), but also the Paratha was missing and the vegetable was soggy and mostly just lettuce. Definitely not worth 16 dollars or the wait. The worst dekalb market experience we have had so far.", "author": "Sanaz Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-29", "description": "I got the the JANI classic burger with the Masala fries. The burger was delicious, moist, with a nice charred flavor. The fries was thick and crispy.

The menu here looked amazing so I gave it a shot. I was not disappointed. The food was sooo good. I had the Seekh kabab with paratha and masala fries. The kabab was kind of spicy but not overwhelming. The white sauce (i think cucumber or dill sauce not sure what's it's called) that is given on the side is amazing. Will definetly be back.", "author": "Joanna V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-02", "description": "Had the seekh kebab, which was flavorful by itself, but came with a cooling raitha sauce .
