After a few bites, I asked if it was exclusively goat cheese and was told that it has mozzarella.  I pointed out that it is not in the menu and the waitress said, \"yes. it's not in the menu, but it has mozzarella\".  The goat cheese was only sprinkled.  I am allergic the cow's milk and fortunately only had a few bites.  Otherwise, I would have been in the ER with an asthma attack.  The staff(waitress and manager) responded promptly and showed concern, but the menu needs editing to say the least.", "author": "Paul S.

We waited about an hour since we didn't have a reservation (I would suggest making one) but hanging by the bar was a great time as well!

Out of the party of 5 no one enjoyed their dish.  I expected more from this franchise as most reviews are 4-5 star ratings. \n\nI ordered the Chicken which was $27 along with a glass of red wine. My colleagues order the Salmon, and some type of Pasta. Being that this chicken was $27 I expected some good seasoning. When I bit into that chicken it was the most unsatisfied I'd ever been over half a chicken. There are restaurants inside Chelsea market that have baked and seasoned a chicken way better. What a waste of money. \n\nOne of my colleagues asked me what was the best part of the meal. I said the \"still\" water which was $9 a bottle of which you can get for $4 elsewhere. :-) \n\nThis place was a joke. The service was actually spot on. But I did have to look for my server a couple of times. \n\nYou're paying for the ambience, the view and good times with friends. Besides that, take your money somewhere else. I felt so bad for my friend because she even complained about the Salmon. We paid for our dishes and left for ice cream. \n\nSECRET- There's a rooftop that many don't know about near the elevator.

Every point where something could go wrong, it basically did. \n\n1. During reservation, they mentioned that a set menu was available at $55 per person. But failed to mention that as a party of 9 we would be actually required to order off the set menu which didn't include any pizzas. Had to \"discuss\" with the management for 40 mins before a compromise was made and we were \"allowed\" to order a couple of pizzas in addition to the set menus. \n\n2. The food was brought out in a strange order. Pizzas came before appetizers. Then one salmon was brought out first (and the waiter actually smacked my colleague in the head with the edge of the plate whilst setting it down - didn't seem too bothered or apologetic about it), and the rest of the food came 7-10 minutes later. \n\n3. The whole dining experience took almost 3.5 hours! One of our group had to actually leave before the mains arrived because no one estimated it would take this long. And the servers would not even bring her meal in a takeout box in time. Every time we asked them multiple times they said the food is almost ready. Perhaps if they were packed it might have been more understandable, but they were more than half empty the entire time. \n\n4. The food was only decent. Nothing special. I will say that the drinks were great though. But not good enough to redeem all the other problems. \n\n5. They tried to charge us for each entree from the set menu separately. This lead to the bill being almost 200% higher than it should have been. \n\nAnd these were only SOME of the issues. \n\nBy the end of it we were so tired with everything in there that we just wanted to leave. The manager didn't even bother coming over to check on us the entire 3.5 hours we were there, so we had to actively go find him. AVOID this place. I would give 0 stars if I could.

Wobbly table that they did nothing to remedy. We were a party of 4 seated at 2 adjoining table.  One of the tables was so wobbly, it was seesawing about 5 degrees from one end to the other.  The wait staff unsuccessfully tried to fix the table, then shrug their shoulders and said - there's nothing else I could do about it.  No offer to seat us at a different table, no apologies.  Just, \"WELL, CAN'T DO IT\"!\n\n2.  Bug in wine.  There was a bug in the wine, we asked if they could swap out for us.  I witnessed the staff behind the bar pour the wine from one glass into another then gave it back to our waiter.  Well, I could have stuck my finger in the wine glass and pinched out the bug if I knew that was what they were going to do!\n\n3.  One dish was forgotten. We ordered a side of vegetable and it never came\n\n4.  Nickle and dime.  We were charged extra for a few small slices of Crostini for the ricotta cheese dip\n\n5.

The huge number of empty tables (for more than one hour) when reservations are not allowed makes completely no sense.\nThen we waited 15 min to get water and menus, another 20 min to get drinks, another 10 min for food and then another 20 min for the check, basically nobody and I mean nobody checks on you to see if you need anything (pepper, another drink, satisfaction with food).

It is by far one of my favorite places to go too. The ambiance and interior are really beautiful as well as the amazing view from the terrace of the water and Brooklyn Bridge.

Didn't mind the time, so we walked in at 10PM, and we were told it was too late to sit and have dinner. Staff was a bit rude about it although we were told to come in around 9:30/10PM over the phone.\nWe almost walked away, but Joy was able to help us out and sort the misunderstanding.

We were prone to be forgotten amongst the more important tables, but our waiter was extremely tentative and accommodating. I ended up sitting there for 2+ hours lost in flowing conversation enjoying great food. \n\nTake advantage of the sommelier for a great wine recommendation. Ask questions if you don't know something and don't be afraid to try something new. They have a great wine menu to pair beautifully with its Italian-themed food so take advantage! She brought us a bottle of kerner, a wine I was trying out for the first time and we finished it EASILY. It's an extremely vibrant and zesty dry wine (cross between Riesling and Sauvignon blanc).\n\nOn to the good stuff. \nBeef carpaccio- simple and delicious. What more is needed?\nTruffle pizza - it's not on the menu but if you request it, they make it happen. Topped with generous portions of thinly sliced truffle (not truffle oil), this pizza is the ultimate treat. Crispy and chewy crust that's slightly burnt on the edges is the best. \nSpaghetti with lobster - different from your average seafood tomato sauce. It's probably the saffron that makes a difference but at this point in my meal, I was a little bit tipsy and couldn't pinpoint what it was that made me coming back for another bite. Point is, I couldn't stop eating this one. \nPanna cotta (dessert special) - I normally hate this dessert because of its jello like texture and gooey consistency, but we ordered it upon both the waiter's and sommelier's recommendation and it was one of the best decisions we made that night. It was incredibly smooth and velvety, like a ribbon elegantly grazing your mouth. Sounds crazy? Try it yourself. \nCherry crostata - it was good too, but not as good as the creme brulee.\n\nOverall, I was hesitant to try this restaurant after reading the numerous mixed reviews, but I'm glad I stopped by.", "author": "Judy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-21", "description": "Work in the neighborhood, and have now been here twice for their daily 4-7 p.m. happy hour.
