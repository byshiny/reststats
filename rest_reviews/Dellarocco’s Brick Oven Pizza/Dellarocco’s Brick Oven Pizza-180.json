What a great addition to Brooklyn Heights this is! Delicious pizza and salads, lovely interior, wine and beer. The margarita pizza was the real standout to me - flavorful, fresh and absolutely yummy! The space is bright and friendly, with a gorgeous red pizza oven in the back. i can't wait to come back!", "author": "Shira R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-11-19", "description": "Poor Service!!! both Hostess and Manager coped an attitude when we confronted them they would not sit us down because they claimed to not have a high-chair.\n\nThey would not let us sit and serve us in the restaurant. While not packed, They said they did not have enough high-chairs...that they would go next door to borrow some (brooklyn heights cafe, which they also own). They came back and said their wasn't any more high-chairs. We sat ourselves down at the table anyway and the waiter said he would not serve us if we did not have a high-chair. We left, only to discover there were 5 high-chairs stacked up available at the next door at brooklyn heights cafe right in the window, when they just said 40 seconds before they did not have any. despicable and lowbrow.", "author": "Katie M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-17", "description": "I love this place. Everything is delicious and made with fresh, quality ingredients. It's a little on the pricey side but worth it for pizza toppings like prosciutto and truffle oil.

This is Italian style pizza ie expect some burnt edges \u0026 great wood fired taste. The Pesto was really good service as well . The oven floor is not hot enough hence the dough could be stiffer but this is nit picking .

I don't think it's necessarily a \"foodie\" place but for the rest of us, every dish and every pizza I've had there has been delicious. The menu is medium/small which is a good thing because they don't try to make everything: they just try to make everything very well!  The price point is perfect. \n\n My one complaint and I actually think this is preventing them from being a destination restaurant: The absolute WORST lighting. \n\n The place is totally uninviting from the \noutside; you could easily walk by without seeing it. If you do see it, it's lit like a down-and-out bodega. once inside, you wonder why it's so dim, but not in a warm flattering way but in a: \"we're losing business and closing soon\" way.  I've never been in a place with creepier, weirder, more unpleasant lighting!  \n\nFix it you guys!  \n\nInstall 6 sconces on the side walls.  Your light is on the blue side; designers know it should be in the red/orange/amber family. Put in some orange or amber floor lamps. It's otherwise a great restaurant.", "author": "Debra V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-11", "description": "Got a little better \u0026 then went downhill again. The carriage trade i.e. screaming babies is unacceptable. The acoustics don't help -- crying babies in sensurround. Yeah, I'd pay money for that. The pizza just ain't that good.

The bread was unpleasantly doughy; the tomato sauce unexceptional and a tad over salted; the meatball appetizer was over salted; in general all the ingredients were low quality.  The standout disappointment was the \"prosciutto\" on the Capricciosa pie.  It says prosciutto on the menu, but it looked and tasted like thick cut boiled Boars Head ham to me, not the delicate slices of high quality cured ham I expected.  For the prices they charge and the tone they set in this \"Wood Fired\" pizza restaurant, you'd expect the mozzarella to be fresh, but it's not.\n\nI get the feeling the owners like to use inexpensive ingredients, charge high prices and make up for it by conning their customers with hip decor and generally decent service.  If the owners of Dellarocco's own the successful Heights Cafe next door like I've been told then, yeah, I guess that's their business model.  Thanks, but no thanks.  I'll take good food in a dump any day over that.  Tremendously disappointing.\n\nI guess we'll have to wait for the entire Fascati family to get back from their ridiculous month-long August vacation if we want good pizza in this 'hood.  And I'll go back to quietly wishing for another unpretentious pizza joint to open up to fill the gap left by the exit of Gourmet more than a decade ago....", "author": "Graham B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-14", "description": "So fabulous! The food was divine. With an amazing arugula salad, eggplant parm appetizer, and prosciutto and arugula pizza my two friends and I were content!

Individual pies are not cheap ($12-15) but worth it.  Fresh mozzarella, crispy blackened crust, fresh ingredients.  I had the Salsiccia which has large pieces of sausage.  The salads are large and definitely enough to share.  Nice selection of draft and bottled beers, plus wine and a full bar.

Tartufo white with truffle gorgonzola and mozzarella also a go to. In going with my vegetarianism the rughetta salad or wood roasted vegetables are enough for a meal on many instances.

I had my favorite Maranara pizza without cheese and the meatballs for appetizer. There are 4 delicious meatballs that reminded me of my grandmothers cooking...so tender....I will assume the rest of the menu is equally as fresh. The service is quite good and the place seems well staffed...We went early around 5 p.m so it was not yet populated....I will try it again and perhaps raise my 4 stars to 5....One problem, at least for me, the bar stools have no backs which make it difficult to go alone for dinner and be comfortable..", "author": "Jerry V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-28", "description": "Ok, so it's expensive, but OMG, the premium ingredients are so worth every penny. The white pizza with spek was amazing. My sister loved the meatball appetizer. We are both in the restaurant biz, and foodies, and the food here really hits it. Our server was fine, busboys very attentive, only complaint I would have is the draft beer could have been colder. Maybe craft beers shouldn't be served super cold, but with pizza a really cold beer is what I'm craving.
