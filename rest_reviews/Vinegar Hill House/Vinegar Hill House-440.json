I could see someone kidnapping this person and forcing them to cook short ribs and pork chops in some small underground kitchen, so beyond outstanding were they that to eat ribs and chops anywhere else would be a painful reminder of the dream deferred.\n\nDid I order the short ribs or the pork chop? No. I ordered the chicken, which was the most tender bird I've ever experienced but lacked the comparative sophistication in flavors, even with its savory rub and crisped veins of rosemary. \n\nEqually frustrating were the lack of side dishes or background to these lovingly tendered main dishes. A bouquet of local, seasonal vegetables would have greatly helped balance these dishes. \n\nThankfully, the wait is not long, the staff is relaxed, personable, and non-stuffy, and while the lack of any background on the plate is frustrating, the outdoor dining area provides plenty of beautiful background to cultivate an anxious expectation of what's to come with a few glasses of wine (or perhaps several bottles) .", "author": "Sheebs W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-14", "description": "Wow this place is really cool, and really delicious.\n\nWe sat at the bar and had the chicken, spicy greens salad, and spaghetti with lobster sauce.

With all honesty, there was not a single course that I did not like, you really can't go wrong with any of these dishes I listed above. The Black Pepper Tagliatelle was my favorite.

But I don't think they pull it off--it's contrived.  I got tired of looking at the paint drip marks on the wood bench across from me.  Reminded me of my public elementary school days when the City was almost bankrupt. \n\nThe food:  The menu is short, and I didn't see any entree that appealed to me, so I ended up with two appetizers.  The tart was ok--whatever cheese they are using is very good. The mussels were just ok. My girlfriend had the cod, which was good, but the portion was half of what it should be.\n\nThe Potatoes Gratin with Celery Root side dish was disappointing and watery.\n\nThe dessert was uninspired.  We tried the pound cake with fresh grapefruit and creme fraise.  And that's exactly what it was. Just some plain pound cake with a few slices of grapefruit sitting on a dollop of creme fraise. Meh.\n\nThe Service: Very casual, which is ok with me--our server must have said \"cool\" at least 20 times.  \n\nHowever, during dessert, they brought out a little French Press of coffee, then when the server pushed the plunger down, spilled 1/3 of it on our table and onto the dessert!  No apology!  The server just looked at the French Press like it was defective, took it away and someone else came to wipe off the table.  There were coffee grounds on the dessert and no attempt to provide another. Oddly, the coffee grounds made the plain pound cake taste better. Eureka!\n\nI won't be back.

We started with the spinach salad.  It came with a bacalao dressing, which added a really interesting salty flavor.  We also had the pea ravioli (super fresh) and the grilled octopus.

The entrees were on the smaller side-- but my boyfriend's roast chicken did not have the fingerling potatoes listed on the menu. Instead the kitchen had substituted with shallots, without telling us and the server said they had run out of potatoes (which puzzled us since...they had a fingerling tart on the menu?) The chicken reeked of sherry vinegar, which made it nearly impossible for boyfriend to eat and enjoy. The popehats pasta was pretty good, though the lamb filling really did not seem to work. \n\nOur server was attentive at first, but post-entree it was pretty hard to get a hold of him since the place had filled up. We decided to forgo dessert and grab a slice elsewhere since we were still starving afterwards and I was actually more satisfied with the slice than my meal (probably coz I was ravenous). \n\nI was pretty sad about this experience since I really dig Freeman's and I loved the atmosphere of Vinegar Hill House.

We had to wait at least 45 minutes after our party arrived though we had a reservation, so minus 1 star for that.\n\nWe shared a few entrees and sides. Stand outs included the rabbit pappardelle ragu, which was phenomenal only a little skimpy on the portion size. We also tried the bone marrow ravioli, which was interesting but (surprisingly) a little unimaginative. The marrow-stuffed ravioli were simply served with a beef broth reduction and a few cannelini beans. A little boring. The chop was lovely yet a little fatty.

It has a quaint little \"hole in the wall\" type feel.\n\nWhen you get to the block of the restaurant, you start to think maybe you got the wrong directions. It looks like a residential neighborhood with no stores or restaurants in sight. Don't give up though. It's there! There are no signs for the restaurant but as you walk by it'll definitely catch your eye. The place is always packed! If you go with one friend, it should be fine. Group dinner is definitely not recommended due the size of the place. It definitely is a good environment. The place is very dimly lit (candles on each table) so it has a nice intimate type feel but then again the next table is literally inches away. So much for privacy! Just wish there was a little more space between the tables for easier movement and that way the next table won't try to cut into your conversation. I was interrupted a couple times by the next table when they wanted to tell us how great the food was without us asking. Maybe they were just crazy people. *shrugz*\n\nOnto the food! First the appetizers, we had ordered the chicken liver mousse with vinegar onions and pistachios. It's basically a spread. You put it on the bread that it comes with and take a bite. So delicious! The mousse was so creamy with great flavors. It has a fatty texture to it. I wish I could have this on toast every day! Plus I love pistachios! After finishing the bread, I just scooped the mousse by itself to try. It can definitely be eaten with just a spoon (like peanut butter) but it tastes so much better with bread. The little salad that comes with it is really fresh and crunchy. The second appetizer is the charred pork belly with masa flatbread, watercress, sour cream and pumpkin seeds. Get a little of everything from this dish and insert into mouth. That's what heaven taste like! The pork belly was amazing! It melts in your mouth like M\u0026Ms. Everything just goes together so well. I don't even know how to explain it. Just go try it and you'll see what I mean! The one thing I regret ordering were the Brussels sprouts. I'm anti-vegetable but I thought I'd give it a shot since it was recommended by some yelpers. Boy do I regret listening to them. Ugh! Not to mention they are slightly burnt (I think it was meant to be that way). It left this nasty taste in my mouth. Luckily there was still some pork belly and mousse left to help me get rid of the bad taste. I would just stick with the belly and mousse. Who needs vegetables when the most popular dish here is...\n\nTHE RED WATTLE COUNTRY CHOPS WITH CHEDDAR GRITS! These pork chops are divine! They were juicy and flavorful. Plus, there was just the right about of fat on them. They were cooked to perfection! The meat basically comes right off. I thought it was a small dish but it is quite the opposite. It is a good sized portion. The cheddar grits were so good too. The grits go very well with the pork chops and the taste of the grits was not overpowering. I ate too many appetizers and couldn't finish my pork chops. Very upset with myself. Thankfully, I was able to take it home and enjoy. They still tasted good the next day!\n\nThe price is not bad for the quality of the food. For two people, a couple of appetizers and one entr\u00e9e each will definitely be over $100. I would definitely go back again for more pork belly and pork chops!

But no matter -- the very nice manager of the restaurant spotted us right away and asked us what we wanted.  We were a party of 4 and he said we could sit at the bar rather than waiting for the table, because there was a wait for a table and the kitchen would probably close before we were seated.\n\nSo we sat at the bar and had excellent service from the bartender throughout our whole meal.  The menu, when you look at it, is not that large and I wonder if they change it frequently.  What is on the menu, however, is all delish and VERY inexpensive for the quality of food they serve.  Starters and entrees are in the $10-$14 range mostly, and the servings are generous.  \n\nWe showed up starving, so we asked the bartender for a cheese plate right away.  I could not remember the names of the cheeses, but they were all SO good.  One of them was a very soft, brie-like cheese that had a mellow flavor, another was a soft blue cheese, and the third was sharp and interesting.  The cheeses came with a little salad that had quail egg in it, some salami and some tasty homemade crackers.\n\nNext we moved on to the shrimp appetizer, which is basically 3 pieces of fully intact shrimp (head, tail and all) roasted and charred just right.  The shrimp was tender and the sauce was smoky and deliciously rich,  and the head and tail were perfectly crisp.  I haven't ever had shrimp that I thought tasted \"rich\" before, but that's how I would describe this shrimp.  The richness of it was nicely balanced with some kind of white root vegetable that they had shredded to look almost like thin pasta noodles.  So the contrast of rich/smoky and cool/crisp was perfect!\n\nFor my entree I got the pea ravioli, which was just as amazing.  Pureed peas were wrapped in the tenderest of ravioli shells, with a few random loose peas scattered here and there and a light sprinkling of parmesan.  But the cool thing about this dish was that it had a minty flavor that gave the dish a really fresh, springtime taste, and I couldn't figure out what it was!  The bartender overheard me talking about it and he told me what it was but I forgot.  It was such a nice surprise to taste that subtle mint flavor along with the peas -- it made the dish unique instead of boring, and I found myself intrigued the whole time I ate it.  There was no indication of any mint sauce on the ravioli so I can only assume they used some kind of mint oil or ground up mint leaves with the pureed peas.\n\nMy friend sitting to my immediate right ordered a very rich, generous portion of roast chicken that came with shallots and was served in the cast iron pan they cooked it in.  They gave so much chicken in that dish, it would have been impossible for one person to finish but it looked perfect for sharing.  Everyone at the table thought it was amazing.\n\nFor dessert, the friend who introduced us to the place insisted we had to get the Guinness chocolate cake.  We took her advice without question and out came two perfectly fresh, homemade-looking slices of chocolate cake topped with a thick layer of smooth, creamy white cake frosting.  We dug in, and the cake was just right.  The frosting had a very nice thick consistency and was not overly sweet in the least.  The cake was rich without being \"oh this is too much!\" rich and also had a very subtle, sweet flavor.  Just perfect.\n\nWhen it was time to sort out the bill, I gawked.  After ordering a cheese plate, 4 starters, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and a bottle of wine, we ended up paying $40 each . . . WITH tip.  It was amazing to me that we had had so much quality food plus a bottle of wine for that low price.  I felt like I had been treated to an expensive meal without it actually being expensive.\n\nSo the food and prices are obviously the major selling points at Vinegar Hill House, but the place has more to offer.  Even though it has a modest, casual dining room that's a little on the small side, the overall experience of being there was pleasant and unexpected.  Every staff member in the restaurant works to make sure you have a good experience there, and you feel really welcome.  Everyone from the manager who first greeted us, to the bartender who waited on us, and everyone else that worked there was so friendly and helpful and offered up plenty of information about the food.  And the kicker?  They played Cure records the whole time we were there.  It was that perfect Brooklyn dining experience that you can't find in Manhattan, and worth the trip out to DUMBO.
