I guess I was misheard. Any who, I decided to take my drink anyway and man WAS IT GOOD. They ask you if you want it sweet/unsweeten and cold/hot. Also, the place is relatively bigger than the one on Montague street. I will definitely comeback and order my thai tea next time haha.", "author": "Ani T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-16", "description": "The store was clean and comfortable.

Every time we go we can't get over the terrible sewage like smell. Other than that the sandwiches are amazing!! Best for takeout so you can avoid the smelly dining experience.

Delivery is never on time, the employees are rude most of the time. I called to check on my order and was asked repeatedly what my problem was, even though I had already expressed my complaints. I was also hung up on. They are overpriced for the portion you get. Decent sandwiches just does not make up for horrible service!!

Especially since they moved to bigger premises with more and better tables.\nMy staple was the Pork Sandwich on wholewheat bun medium spicy but more recently I've started ordering the Pho soups.

This is all you need to read because everything else I say will just reinforce that thought.  Grilled pork sandwich spicy.  Done.  Grilled pork, amazing.  pickled veggies, different texture, very complimentary.  slightly toasted bread, perfect vessel to deliver the food.  All this is enough to make me go there several times a week.  But wait... there is a treat... bubble tea.  Almond tea with skim milk and tapioca balls, sweet and fun.

Vegetarians and people eating less meat will be happy with all the veggie friendly options.  I've had the tofu, veggie chicken and veggie pork banh mis and they were all great.

That and the recommendation came from a foodie friend.\nI've been dying to try the bahn mi and it was a toss up between the Classic (roasted ground pork, vietnamese ham, pate, mayo, butter, cucumber, pickled carrots \u0026 daikon radish and cilantro on a toasted french baguette) and the grilled pork but I figured for my first time I wanted to go with the staple of the menu and go Classic. I took a seat in one of the 6 small tables and 3 minutes later I realized I made the best decision in the past month of my life. SWEET BABY JESUS!!\nFirst off, go hungry! For $6 you get quite a large stuffed sandwich that will really fill you. I usually take a pic of my food but I was starving and as soon as I unwrapped it I couldn't wait. The bread, unlike other bahn mis, is toasted which holds up to the juices from the pork and doesn't fall apart. Every bite is like fireworks going off in your mouth from the different tastes and textures. The crispy warm bread, the deep Asian flavors of the meats along with the heat (I ordered mine medium because I must add Sriracha so I knew that would give it another bump) then you get the crunch and coolness of the bright, pickled veggies and cilantro. This is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had....really! \nI must go back soon and give the grilled pork a try. This place is a GEM and worth the trip from even NJ or further!", "author": "Monica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-29", "description": "I really love the green tea matcha with boba.

Yes, I am reviewing Hanco's based on their sardine sandwich. \n\nHere's why: the classic banh mi is a good thing. But it's also a thing that's hard to get wrong, in my opinion. There's the standard ingredients organized in the standard way, and diners are happiest when the banh mi conforms, rather than flouts, expectations. So better to try the menu item that allows a Vietnamese sandwich shop some flexibility. Like the sardine variation!\n\nAt the banh mi joint in Park Slope (Lotus, I think?), the sardines are very nearly whole. Just nice, savory filets laying in some spicy sauce on a bun. Good. At Hanco's, the sardines are a little more mashed up with some spicy mayonnaise. That is also a good approach, although it means you have to each your sandwich quickly before the bread gets too soggy.\n\nSo by my glancing estimation, Hanco's is good enough for me.", "author": "Pamela B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-12", "description": "The veggie pork here is delicious.
