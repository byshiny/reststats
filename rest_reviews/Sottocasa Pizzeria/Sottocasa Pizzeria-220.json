If you like both of them, great, but remember, they're two different thing.\n\nAt Sottocasa you'll get the REAL Italian pizza, Napoli Style. And believe me, as an Italian I can just confirm that. \nThe ingredients are super fresh and the taste...OMG! I feel like \"welcome home\" every time I step in and I order my Reginella (Just try it!).\nPeople inside are great, super easy and relaxed. And they're real as well...I mean, a lot of them are real Italians, starting from the owner/pizzaiolo. :)\nThe atmosphere it's just the perfect mix between a nice Italian restaurant and the Brooklyn Style that I love.\n\nI like the thing that if you call for a delivery they say, on the website, that it's not the best thing to do - Pizza has to be eaten right after it gets out from the oven -. \nWell, believe me...I called also for delivery and the pizza is good, very good...but it's definitely you better listen what they say! :)\n\nBravi!", "author": "Fabio F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-17", "description": "Sorry.....but that wasn't the most pleasant tasting pizza or service experienced this time. Pizza base was soggy and wet on one of the pizzas and straight after the query re dessert we were given the bill. No asking if we would like another wine or coffee. We were in that restaurant for a total of 40 min......\nDefinitely tasted hotter, crispier, drier bases and had better service in small country towns in Australia.", "author": "Susi R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-28", "description": "Went here on a date the other night after seeing a movie down the street at the cinema. Walked in super hungry and was immediately hit in the face with the smell of fresh dough baking in a fire. (There should be a candle for that small - somebody please make that). Service was great, we were seated right away and had our drinks with our delicious Burrata pizza (Fri-Sun only special) shortly following - on a Saturday night at 10 o'clock I mind you. I'll definitely be back time and time again. This place is one that reminds me yet again why I love living in Brooklyn.", "author": "alicia c."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-21", "description": "Truly authentic Italian cuisine. \nLoved every minute of it.\nAntipasto and pizza was to die for.\nStaff were very friendly and kind.\n100% recommend it.", "author": "Karla S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-02", "description": "This is a cool spot, in a great neighborhood, with awesome 'za and huge calzones.

I can't go on and on about the puffiness of the crust or the amount of char on the underside of the pizza. I'll leave that to the experts at the pizza blogs. But I've eaten at most of the great pizza places in NY and this one ranks right up there with Keste.\n\nThe Food\n\nThe ingredients they use are fresh and many of them come directly from Italy, as we were told by the server. I'm not one for meat on pizzas, so I've had the Quattro Stagioni (w/o ham) and the Verdure. Both are excellent! My friend liked his Salsiccia so much that he actually ordered another one and took half of it home. Our only minor misstep was the Sfiziosa - the anchovies were a bit too salty for our taste.\n\nThe Rest \n\nNice wine selection, and plenty of Italian beers that I've never seen before. Decor and staff are warm and inviting.", "author": "Roy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-26", "description": "the burrata was phenomenal. Also many interesting beers. The Laura was a little low on salt, but still great.

Probably one of the best I've eaten in my life (and I've been in Italy a few times. So I would say I have good references of what a good pizza looks like.). The dough is very good, very Italian. They use good ingredients. The dessert was pleasant too. I would totally give 5 starts for the food and restaurant atmosphere.\nI gave 4 start because of the waiter's bad mood. We asked for 3 pizzas but just 2 was served. When we asked about the third pizza, he said nothing. He didn't even apologize for the misunderstanding, just went to the kitchen and made the order. Actually we felt he was impatience since the beginning and after our complaint he looked at us like it was our fault for some reason.\nI don't know it's always like this, but it spoiled the experience a little bit. \nAgain, the pizza is great and worth it in spite of the waiter's mood. Just try to be clear and check if he got all your order.", "author": "Br\u00ednea C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-04", "description": "I took here my italian sister and her boyfriend for a saturday italian meal\nWe took a cured meat and cheese board. The salami was def too dry and too thin. \nThe pecorino toscano was very good and well cut. We also had Parma prosciutto and in my opinion was too salty, and this one also too dry, maybe cause it was near the end or just opened. \nThen we took 3 pizzas, 2 quattro formaggi and 1 tartufata.\nThe 4formaggi was not cooked enough, def too spongy and i would have appreciated an higher presence of gorgonzola cheese.\nAs dessert we took 3 tiramis\u00f9. That tiramis\u00f9 was AMAAAAZIND, delicious, creamy, we looved them. \nOur waiter was Luca, a very good looking and charming guy from Gorizia. He was very professional, precise, kind and with a nice smile on.

Yelp doesnt allow more than 5 stars and 2. I just had to re-confirm how awesome this place is (while at the same time discredit any crazy naysayers who think this place is anything less than perfection). Had me some parmigiana pizza and a calzone type thingie plus a carafe of wine (which they very generously filled to the very brim) and tartuffo and espresso for dessert!

As I was leaving, I thought, \"Wow. I haven't written a review in over two years but this place seriously deserves the highest of 5-star reviews.\"\n\nWe started with two pizzas, the reginella and the radicchio, and they were so good we devoured them almost immediately. As we were eating, we ordered two more; the prosciutto crudo and the salsiccia. So, among a party of five, we ate four pizzas. \n\nEverything about the pizzas were good. From the dough to the crust to the sauce to the ingredients and the toppings, everything was good. \n\nThe service here was just as great as the food, too. We were seated immediately, our glasses were consistently refilled, and the waiter came by our table a few minutes after we started eating to ask how the food was, both times. \n\nThe pizzas here typically come in four slices, so when the first two arrived to the table, my group started cutting them into smaller ones. The waiter noticed within seconds and offered to take them back to have them recut. When the third and fourth pizza came out, they came out with eight slices each. Everything about the restaurant was just incredibly meticulous. \n\nI've already recommended this place to my friends.
