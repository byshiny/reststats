Greene. Feels almost like a second home, don't know if that is something I should be admitting to :) The staff is absolutely lovely from the superb bartenders to the courteous waitstaff. It really is the best place to go if you just want a great lunch/dinner and be absolutely taken care of. I usually sit at the bar and drinks margaritas and eat their AMAZING selection of oysters. However, their deviled eggs, fried chicken, fries and burgers are all fcking delicious as well. Atmosphere is an A+. \n\nOne thing I would say is that I wish they had a good healthy green salad option on the dinner menu... so that I wouldn't be constantly tempted to get the fried chicken...", "author": "Marykate M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-15", "description": "Was not bad.

Atmosphere is good, prices are fair. As I recall, they don't do any substitutions- however they did swap out my home fries for their delicious french fries. Sorry to all you home fry lovers, but they just don't do it for me. \n\nGive me deep fried or give me death!!! (You can put that on my tombstone)\n\nRIP.

Definitely be prepared to wait around a half hour if you come with a bigger group. The staff was really friendly and the restaurant itself is very cute. The food was solid. I got the huevos rancheros and my boyfriend got the chicken and waffles. Not the best we have ever had of either but definitely very good. The brunch cocktails were awesome.

Thought it'd be perfect given the good reviews. It is a gorgeous space and we had a nice waitress, but the food was awful. It was cheap diner food at ridiculously inflated prices. The egg in the Benedict was rock hard and the Huevos Rancheros tasted like it came out of a can. The OJ was fresh, but that was it.

Really? \nThis is the best Burger I've had in NYC. Period. Walters is a really great vibe, great food, great cocktails. Go for the orange manhattan.  \n\nStaff is ok. Some are great.

You win, Walter's.\n\nA friend and I stopped in here one evening for dinner and I was immediately smitten with the atmosphere of this place. Very classic and almost retro. We noticed that there wasn't a hostess so we approached the bartender and asked him if there were any tables available. He saw that there was just two of us and he quickly showed us to a nearby table. The waitress seemingly popped out of thin air with glasses of water (with slices of cucumbers inside, how cute!)  and informed us of the special for that evening. We decided that we both wanted to try the Walter's Burger and let me tell you...when I say this is one of the best burgers I've ever had...I genuinely mean it. The fries were on a whole different level, they didn't need any condiments whatsoever - they were perfectly fine on their own. Sometimes you eat something that just tastes so good that it's almost confusing, and this was one of those times. I didn't understand how french fries could possibly be that delicious.\n\nDuring our meal, our waitress politely asked us if they could move us to another table due to a reservation that showed up 45 minutes early and we obliged. Not a problem whatsoever. Our waitress then gave us a free apple pie a la mode at the end of our meal for being accommodating. So lovely!\n\nI HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend Walter's for lunch, brunch, dinner, or just to grab drinks. I love this place.\n\nxx MJ", "author": "Momo J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "Great neighborhood spot.

Artichoke dip. Hangar Steak. Fries. the fries were sick.\n\nTiny tables and close quarters. A couple making out at the bar. Awesome service. Hip vibe - i felt like i should be skinnier and yuppier but the food was just power solid if that even makes sense. It just had a hoppin, almost pubby vibe but also had decor that sort of reminded me of that place on 9th and 3rd in gowanus - what is that place?

I have yet to be let down. My last meal was on this past Saturday evening.\n\nBeet Salad. A mound of sumptuous assorted greens with an amazing dressing, and goat cheese to die for. The beats are cut down into slim chunks, so they're easy to divide up across every glorious bite. I wish I had one in front of my right now.\n\nBlackened Catfish. I am astounded at how good this piece of fish is at $16. The hot pepper mixes so well with the cabbage cole slaw. The tartar sauce sat on the table next to my plate, completely unused. Why ruin such wonderful flavor? Catfish tasted light and not the slightest hint of brine. Outstanding, especially considering the price.", "author": "Kevin D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-27", "description": "I've been meaning to go to Walter's for about a year, and finally made it this weekend. I needed a brunch spot open early (10 am), which can be a tough thing to find, but Walter's delivered. The atmosphere was great. Good service, good food, good music. All-in-all an excellent experience.\n\nOf course, being open early means that there were a lot of kids. So if you're looking for kid-friendly, that's good.

We ordered the fried chicken, which was phenomenal, and the pork chop, which was one of the best I have ever had.

There was a 20 minute wait, but it was well deserved. My friend had the fried chicken and waffles w/ cinnamon butter. The chicken was very moist and crunchy (perfect southern fried chicken).
