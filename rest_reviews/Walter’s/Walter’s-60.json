The first time we had the artichoke dip, the grilled octopus, the deviled eggs and the burger plus a few glasses of wine. The artichoke dip is a must - chunky artichoke smothered in pepper jack cheese and grana padano with perfectly toasted crostini. The only drawback is you'll like this so much that you'll eat too much and get full before the other yummy food comes! The octopus and deviled eggs were good but not memorable, but the Walter burger on a brioche bun with friends that are skinny and crispy and just the right amount of oily served with ketchup, mustard and mayo is a must. The second time we returned (all within one month, rare for us!) and got the artichoke dip again, the baby back ribs with red cabbage cole slaw (personally would skip this) and the grilled bar steak, also served with the same delectable fries and with horseradish cream and chimichurri. There's no question about whether we will return - the only question will be steak or burger, and you really can't go wrong with either. Definitely make a reservation (taken on Resy for dinner but not brunch) and given the tight quarters probably best for groups of 4 or smaller.", "author": "Alice C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-08", "description": "Our entire table had the chicken and waffles.

We went with the latter. For dinner, I highly recommend the steak. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well - a bonus is that it is served over a huge plate of salad and crisp french fries with a tangy chimichurri sauce and a delicious horseradish sauce. I wish I could eat this steak every night. It's that awesome. \n\nI've been for weekend brunch, as well, and enjoyed it just as much. The blackened catfish and cabbage slaw on a kaiser roll is delicious and dripping with spicy tartar sauce. Also good is the shakshuka and the eggs benedict. I really do not think you can go wrong at Walter's. Great food, a well-decorated and lovely setting and nice service.

The chicken is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Dip in the syrup or hot sauce. Waffles are pillowy.  My cucumber mint lemonade was more sour than cucumber of mint. \n\nArtichoke dip is cheesy with a tiny little kick  toast points are crispy and dip helps it all become gooey goodness. Duck buns are more with shredded meat but still warm and delish. Husband burger was plump and moist but outside was just a tad burnt.

Walters was amazing. I started with the honey suckle, so delicious- white rum, lime and honey!! Light and not too sweet (my main\nproblem with most cocktails), the boneless ribs were so tender and the flavors exploded in my mouth! The French fries were hot and perfectly salted, carrots were seasoned with a hint of lime, and the salmon with kale was grilled with cherry tomatoes, kale had just the right amount of lemon. I have to go on...flourless chocolate cake was so delicious! All of this food was under $100, AMAZING SERVICE, food came out steaming hot, perfect timing, amazing staff. I am not easily impressed.

The Gin Fizz was light and refreshing, I would definitely recommend it, although the price was a little steep (around $11+).\n\nI ordered the huevos rancheros, which was altogether mediocre. Decent helping of guacamole on top, but overall the dish seemed to lack seasoning and the entire plate itself was lukewarm in temp. Hubby ordered the french toast, which was rather on the drier side. However, the maple syrup was citrusy and delicious and the accompanying fruit was tender and savory, so we did enjoy it.\n\nOverall, I thought our meals were fine, but nothing that would make me eager to come back. Also our bill ended up being $62 between the 2 of us for two brunch entrees and two cocktails, so a little steep in our books.", "author": "Cecily S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-05", "description": "Oh the chicken \u0026 waffles are so worth the sometimes long line.

We ordered the chicken and waffles and veggie breakfast sandwich with a side of sausage on a bagel and hash browns.   We were greeted and served right away and our food \u0026 drink orders arrived promptly.  The chicken was excellent fall off the bone crispy and not overly greasy.  The brine they use really tenderized the chicken. Our waffle portion was equally as good the batter was flavorful and the texture of the waffle was light and airy. The breakfast sandwich had a generous amount of avocado and sprouts but the bagel used was well past its freshness date. Hash browns reminded me more of smashed potatoes than hash browns but they were tasty. Next time I would order it on a brioche instead.  Service was excellent and our mimosas were nice and bubbly.

We almost missed it walking by, as the exterior is pretty low profile (which I love), but once inside, the place was PACKED!  Closely spaced tables and bar seating, made the place feel cozy and inviting on a very cold, December day.  \n\nOne thing I would definitely commend, is the swift service!  Even though we arrived at the busiest time of day, we were sat quickly, served courteously, and were eating within a few minutes.  Very impressive!  We ordered Eggs Benedict and the house Burger, and both were delicious.  The burger was cooked perfectly, medium rare.  The hollandaise sauce was heavy on the lemon and generous.  The eggs benedict is served with hash browns that are shaped more like a latke, slipped beneath each muffin.  The crisp, saltiness was really tasty and I liked this type of plating.  Also, loved the shoe-string fries with the burger.

You get there and she's sitting at the table in dimly lit romantic lighting, looking fine as hell.  You can't believe your luck.

When we walked in, it was pleasantly buzzing, sexily lit, and felt like it had the right mix of cool and laidbackedness. \u2020\u2020\u2020  The staff was pleasant, the crowd was at the right level of hipness and age... everything felt just right.  And then, sadly, the food came...\n\n1.  I have never tasted a more bland duck bun\n2.  The duck wings tasted like burnt, crisp nothing.  The serving had 3 wings, for a party of 4, and one was left back.  At this point, they need to give up on duck entirely.\n3.  The charred octopus was not really charred.  It seemed like it was breaded and fried or something.  Definitely.  Not.  Charred.\n4.  The flourless chocolate cake crumbled and tasted like dust.  Tip: if it keeps coming out this way, use flour.\n\nThe saving graces were the mains.  The fried chicken was decent... points there.  Moist, flavorful... however I was not a fan of the dipping sauce on the side, whatever it was.  The chicken was good enough on it's own.  This dish literally saved the meal for me, and I clutched to the memory of it for dear life as I picked my way through dessert.\n\nSo in the end, points for atmosphere, scene and fried chicken... that's 3.  But if you want my opinion, walk an extra 10 minutes and go to Marietta.  You'll be much happier.\n\n\u2020\u2020 Yes I just aged myself right there.  I'm old.
