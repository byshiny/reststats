But I can't in good conscience signal would-be diners with a 3-Star review that this place is worth going back to. Maybe brunch is good, but dinner is not. \n\nAnd yet, if poor execution can be forgiven, unapologetically poor execution cannot. Nor can \"Service with a frown;\" where's the cheery greeting, upbeat feeling, or even--gasp--gratitude for our patronage?\n\nAlmost all of the dishes were overcooked. Stew was watery. To their credit, they did ask \"how's everything?\" but did nothing about it when we expressed disappointment. Chicken wings were the lone standout: if only all the dishes were like this. \n\nFinally, let me correct my fellow reviewers: the drinks are quite AFFORDABLE (quite the deal during happy hour, and even post-HH, about 30% cheaper than neighboring spots), but not good.", "author": "Food Jerk X."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-18", "description": "Great little cozy drink spot! I was working in town for a night and got finished quite late- I headed here for a post work night cap because there were few places open at 2:30 and it was near my hotel. \nI was very pleasantly surprised by the warm ambiance and the open friendliness of the bartender Bianca and the other patrons.  I was too late for food, but the drinks were wonderful- they make a killer spicy margarita. Had a lovely time and many great conversations. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town!", "author": "Michelle S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-01", "description": "I am so excited to write a review about this great gem in Brooklyn!\n\nMy mother and I came here from NJ for brunch on Easter. It had been recommended to us - and it was well worth the trip!\n\nTheir food is outstanding. It's a Persian-fusion restaurant - so the majority of the menu is familiar Brooklyn-brunch fare, but has little twists that set it apart.\n\nFor example, their Persian Omelette includes dates as an ingredient to give it a hint of sweetness (but if it's not your thing, they have no problem leaving it out!)\n\nThe service here is great. A very friendly hipster staff that reminds you that you're still in Brooklyn :) very attentive.\n\nThey also have a full bar - in fact, they have an all-inclusive lunch for $17.\n\nI think this is my new favorite brunch spot in Brooklyn. I definitely plan on returning with my husband for dinner, as well as some friends for weekend brunches!", "author": "Azy B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-13", "description": "The best happy hour in town!!!\nSuch a perfect location, stopped in after a day of shopping at Fulton mall.

We've gone to Bijab's twice this summer and have enjoyed its offering's. The Kababs'  and soups are outstanding as are the mixed drinks.

I've watched her take care of people that've arrived after me, bringing them water and taking their order. While I sit here having to flag her down for both... After she took water to both tables I purposely waited to see if she was coming to me next. She just went about her business cleaning up the tables around me as if I weren't sitting here....\n\nI'll elaborate further at the end of my experience here...\n\nSoooooooo I wound up leaving 10 minutes after I left the top portion of this review.

Even my sister's eggs Benedict which was stone cold when it came out was good. My steak and eggs were amazing even though my eggs were simultaneously over cooked and undercooked (uneven grill much??). The real reason for only 3 stars? The service. Beyond bad. Absolutely terrible. Maybe it was the waitress' first day. That can be the only explanation.  And they only take cash!!!", "author": "Leigh Ann T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-17", "description": "The menu looked delicious, I can't wait to come back with friends.

Such a cozy little spot. I ordered the steak frites and my friend ordered the rosemary lime sumac chicken. We were literally fighting over each other's food and when I was done, my plate looked as if I had licked it clean. Everything was flavored to perfection. And the waitress was very friendly.

It's obviously very fresh, really well seasoned, beautifully plated. The portions are a great size, in some cases bigger than average.  As a table we had the pistachio salmon, chicken kabob, lamb burger and I think the last one was a Bijan burger. The burgers looked amazing, and our friends described them as wonderful. My salmon and my partner's kabob were delicious and really filling. \n\nI love the atmosphere here, the decor and the silent movies playing on the wall. The wait staff was very pleasant and the food was brought out in good time even though the place was packed.\n\nHowever I have to give this place only four stars for the following reasons:  It had just rained and in the summer when it rains, shortly after it gets super humid. They left the doors open. It was hotter and more humid inside the restaurant than it was outside. They should have shut the doors, turned on the AC and allowed us to eat in comfort.  Another thing was that every time someone stood outside and smoked, it didn't matter that they were outside. Because the doors were open it felt like they were smoking right beside me while I was eating, so what's the point of them even going outside? \n\nHowever if those things won't bother you, definitely come here. The food is well worth!", "author": "Tal D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-26", "description": "Bijans is a great place! The food is always consistent and delicious. It's a nice winter spot as well...the fireplace is such an added bonus. 4 stars because weekend brunch is cash only which is strange since after a certain time they start taking credit cards again. This process is just really inconvenient.", "author": "Craig K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-31", "description": "This cozy little gem is a must-try!

The poor attitude of the bartenders not so. We personally did not have an issue sitting at the bar, but we saw a group enter, wait to be addressed, told they could sit anywhere, and they did. This is when it got crazy... the other bartender shows up to work, and the bartender that was working proceed to say she banked 2k all by herself, and she was done. She then says I'm not serving the \"VIP table\".  Bartender looks over at the group that went to sit anywhere at a high top table in their alcove, goes WTF is wrong with them.  Whatever she said to the patrons they upped and left. Let's say they were not whispering at all.
