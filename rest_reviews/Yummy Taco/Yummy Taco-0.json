Well the first thing I noticed was that it looks extremely tacky. The place looks as if the color orange vomited on it and they didn't bother cleaning up. Not only do they have Christmas ornaments hanging, but they have Christmas lights as well. They have signs written in marker, one of them saying \"Cash Only\", which is unfortunate. I was going to order an $8 meal with my card but only had $3 in cash which bought me a chicken taco.\nFirst things first, the \"tex-mex\" food is made by Asians. I have nothing against them other than the fact that I don't believe the food tastes Mexican. In fact, the chicken in the taco tastes like chicken teriyaki. I could only imagine that's what they're using. The taco comes with chicken, lettuce, tomato, and American cheese, wrapped in a flour tortilla. To be honest, the poor quality can only be excused by it's cheap price. At least it doesn't taste horrible, but I would just rather eat at Taco Bell.", "author": "Christian G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-15", "description": "i normally attend yummy taco in manhattan by 59th st.. and i love the food, it's affordable lunch place for this graduate student.

I might very well have to try some food then then write a report. Service was fast at Yummy Taco. We decided to take out our orders as we had just returned from lunch at a restaurant in Flushing Chinatown of which I will review another time. It was a long ride back to downtown Brooklyn so we decided to stop here and try some Mexican food. I tried the burrito while my friend tried the fajitas. I would rate the burrito 8/10. I have eaten better tasting burrito when I used to be out in California. But this is acceptable if you want to eat Mexican. There are some chairs in there if you chose to sit and dine in. The decor is so so. The menu seems extensive. So I will have to return to try out another dish another day. I notice that all the fried chicken joints around that area have disappeared. People are looking for more healthier foods instead of the fried stuff.", "author": "Wayne S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-12", "description": "Love  this tex mex spot hands down. Best hangover food. The tacos aren't expensive \u0026 are best eaten fresh. The food doesn't take long to make. Perfect cheap lunch.

I came in here after doing some shopping today at Macy's when I realized I would be home too late for lunch. \n\nI looked at the menu and ordered the vegetable soup ( which came with tortillas according to the the menu) and a shrimp taco.  It didn't take long to get my food. I decided to eat the soup in the restaurant. The soup had broccoli, white button mushrooms onions and a piece of grilled chicken cutlet cut into slices.  It tasted more like Chinese soup than Mexican. I was given one small pack of  pico de gallo.  I used that for the soup. Since i wanted one for the taco when I was done with the soup I asked for another container of pico de gallo and I was given it.  \n\nWhen I ate the shrimp tacos, it contained 4 shrimp, shredded cheddar cheese which was not melted lettuce and diced tomato.\n\nBoth the shrimp and the chicken was well seasoned., moist and tasty.  The chicken was grilled which was a surprise since it was in soup.", "author": "Suresh D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-23", "description": "Their guacamole nachos were such a disappointment. I am annoyed I consumed all of those calories. The only reason I continued to eat them was because I had some hope that in some weird way it would hit the spot. Nope.

So I said what the heck, let me give it a try. I ordered a steak quesadilla, nothing special and I must say it was pretty good. Although I wish I had onions and tomatoes in it..but that is my fault for not stating that. The best part about the quesadilla for me was the tortilla wrap lol.

Yes please. When you want some good ol low quality food, this is your place. This is going to be your favorite dive spot. After a morning of day drinking nothing hits the spot like a tough chicken taco and finger licking buffalo wings. Always get extra sauce cause it thin and doesn't go far and you'll need the extra sauce for the dry ass chicken. I know I sound like I don't like this place but I actually really do.
