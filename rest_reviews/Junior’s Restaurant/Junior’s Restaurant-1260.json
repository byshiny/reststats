I had a grilled chicken sandwich for my dinner and it was good but how can you make grilled chicken bad?  It wasn't anything outstanding.\n\nI also had a slice of the cheesecake.  I am also of the gram cracker crust camp.  The cheesecake was good, but I didn't want to have sex with it like I do when there is something I really like.\n\nGlad I came to experience a Brooklyn institution but if I never had their cheesecake again, my life wouldn't be lacking or anything.\n\nNot bad... but certainly not great.", "author": "Ms T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-12-09", "description": "I really miss you brooklyn.\n\nI'm a plain girl and I like plain cheesecake especially from Junior's.

I had ordered a cheeseburger and asked for it to be cooked well-done. We waited for our food for about 30 minutes and once it arrived I was faced with disappointment. The burger was extremely dry and not cooked very well. The onion rings were just bland and everything about the burger was just horrific. I had paid about $14 yet I only finished the fries and left the entire burger practically untouched. The only good thing about this place I guess was the cheesecake but then again I could have gotten a cheesecake just as good somewhere else for a much cheaper price. So all in all I spend about a little over $20 for a couple of fries and some spoonfuls of cheesecake. Not worth anyones time tbh.", "author": "Nishat C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-19", "description": "Came here with a couple of my co workers before our flight back to San Francisco. We heard the Cheesecake was the best and surely enough it was delicious. Unfortunately I knew about this place after I had grabbed lunch, but if I were to get a chance to come back I would definitely try out their entree's it sounds good.

And it's been a sad time to see him depart.  And although it'll take some time for us to get over this loss... he so kindly reached out to help us mend our hearts a little with a variety of cheesecakes from Juniors in NY!  My first thought when I saw the email was, \"hmmm cheesecake all the way from NY?  It must be good for him to send a couple of them to us here.\"  So off I went to try some.  \n\nI wasn't able to grab a sample of each flavor he sent... that would just be too much =x hehe... so I got a sliver of Tiramisu and a sliver of Chocolate Mousse.  And as I sit here and write this review, I'm thinking the Tiramisu Cheesecake is gooooood.  There's this crunchy layer in it that I'm enjoying and overall it's making my palette happy.  =) BUT... the sliver of the Chocolate Mousse cheesecake, I'm totally dying over right now.  It's cold, it's smooth, it's melty and it has chocolate chips around it.... mmmmm... delicioso!!  Chocolate's my thing yo!  \n\nDefinitely a place to consider next time I want to send someone something or have something yummy for a special occassion!  I'd go right in there if I could, but perhaps next time I'm in NY.  =D  That's not to say the Bay Area doesn't have good cheesecake, because we have some bomb diggity choices around here, but something different is always fun!!......... oh wow, yup, just took another bite of the Chocolate Mousse... n omg wow!!  still good... maybe even better than the first bite.  =)  My palette thanks you boss man!!!", "author": "Jo D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-01", "description": "I love cheese cake and this place has best cheesecake period!

I'm pretty picky when it comes to cheesecake and for the couple of years I lived in NYC, I never found a place that made it well.  You know, creamy, rich and cheesy!\n\nJuniors has it all covered.  My favorite is their strawberry and their plain.  I had there apple crumb which I wasn't really a fan of, but it was still very good.  They also have red velvet cake which I do not recommend, as there are a few other places in Brooklyn that make the red velvet far better.\n\nOverall, I love Juniors and I recommend them if you're ever in the big apple and in the mood for some good NY cheesecake!", "author": "Kat A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-21", "description": "I really enjoy eating here.  While the food isn't overly special, I will say that it is very good with a decent amount of selection.  Junior's as a whole is one of those places that I take out-of-towners when they visit me.  The cheesecake is wonderful, but the cakes tend to be a little over iced.\nA +/- of Junior's are the portion sizes.  If you are eating there by yourself, it will be too much for any decent sized human being.  If you are with friends or family, you can easily split most of the meals between two or three of you.

My suggestion is don't buy the individual cheescake slices prepackaged to go it is sometimes not so fresh.  I also recommend the sandwiches on the twin rolls, you get more for your money and will probaably take one home for later, my favorite is the cornbeef, turkey, tongue with swiss cheese and russian dressing awesome!!\nBottomline is Juniors is Brooklyn and the service and location are great, allways a good time.", "author": "Jon K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-05", "description": "Strawberry Cheesecake.

It was like a weight it was so dense but man it was rich.\n\nThe two tiny young Italian girls at dinner were somehow able to eat massive amounts while I could barely finish a small piece.  It was wonderfully rich though so probably just as well.\n\nTo top it all off, all I actually had was the cheese-pie - not even the full-on cheese-cake which Collin insisted was bigger and better.
