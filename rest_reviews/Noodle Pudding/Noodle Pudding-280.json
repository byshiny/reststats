Noodle Pudding's answer is their gregarious owner and clientele. The italian food is medicare to good depending on your dish BUT there is always something going on here to capture your attention. They held an impromptue Operetta with a few local performers who were dining during with us the last time I ate here. Overall the food should be rated 3 starts, but the atmosphere is a solid 4.", "author": "Mike M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-10", "description": "This is my favorite restaurant, a charming neighborhood, rustic Italian place with exceptional \u0026 friendly service and great care taken to make simple dishes shine. I've been disappointed by many fine dining experiences in NYC, but NEVER by Noodle Pudding, and that is one of the true culinary charms of our city - the little neighborhood places that just rock, every single time.\n\nIt's a small place, with seating for maybe 60 patrons at any given time, but they serve the food quickly and turn the tables over fast - it's an impressive operation. The staff are all very friendly \u0026 knowledgeable people, and in the 3 years I've been going there there has not been much turnover.\n\nThe highlight is of course the food. They have a number of daily specials that vary slightly from day to day and more significantly from season to season, as well as a small staple of regular dishes, and everything's great. They start you off with loaves of peasant style white bread and spice infused olive oil, which is always heartwarming, and while you're chewing on that you might as well go ahead and order a bottle of their tasty $12 house Montepulciano D'Abruzzo. There is no better wine value in NYC.\n\nThe pastas make my mouth water just thinking about this - they do an excellent gnocchi and will serve it either with butter \u0026 sage or al pomodoro, their bolognese is hearty \u0026 good, and their meat lasagna is terrific. Some memorable specials are the papardelle with lamb \u0026 olive rag (I rarely pass this up if it's on offer), the Spaghetti Sciue Sciue, and the black seafood spaghetti. \n\nFor fish \u0026 fowl, their grilled herbed chicken breast over arugula is a can't miss winner, and Vinnie's line caught Montauck bass is prepared about the same way and is just as great, when they have it. The tagliata steak with grilled vidalias \u0026 tomatoes is always wonderful, and if I'm feeling really bad, I'll just stumble down there for the osso bucco. It's very special.\n\nThere's a lot of Brooklyn dining places you'll hear more about, but few you'll enjoy more. Do yourself this favor real soon.", "author": "Justin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-30", "description": "I have only been here twice, and the two times were a while back.  However, I consider this to be a hidden gem of Brooklyn Heights.  My ex-boyfriend told me about it a long time ago, and mentioned it was hard to find because it doesn't have an obvious sign.  When my mom and I came to New York a few years ago, I suggested we come here.  Everything was delicious.  They had no issues accommodating me being a vegetarian, and I even ended up with a \"custom\" dish that was some type of rolled eggplant.  It blew me away.  My mom got something with seafood... can't remember what... but she loved it.  I came back a couple of years later, when I was living there, and had an experience that was much the same.  \n\nIt's a pretty small space, but aren't most places in New York like this?  You can't expect a lot of room.  That's been my experience.  I think they've made the most of what they have, and they have a good thing going with the menu.  The wait staff was attentive and pleasant, and I would absolutely come back.", "author": "Leigh M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-05", "description": "The food is always fresh and that's not surprising. The owner of the restaurant can frequently be spotted buying fruit and vegetables at the local farmers' market. The food is delicious and their Tiramisu is heavenly! \n\nThe atmosphere is hard to describe. The place is large and buzzing with energy. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations.

There is nothing fancy shmancy or overly complex here, so don't come looking to be \"wowed\" or for inventive dishes. They serve standard, traditional italian cuisine. \n\nTheir fresh bread and oil dip is served when you sit down (and refilled as many times as necessary). The pastas and appetizers are made with such fresh ingredients and keep you eating beyond the point of stuffed (i've been known to unbutton my pants). They have many wines and most are reasonably priced! What more is there to ask for?!\n\nFor a relaxed and delicious Sunday dinner, the place to go is Noodle Pudding.", "author": "Steph G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-07", "description": "Great spot...stumbled upon this restaurant in Brooklyn Heights last night, and couldn't have been more pleased. Without reservations we were seated within 10 minutes of arriving.\n\nSuch an oddly named Italian restaurant, but the food was fantastic...some great authentic dishes like sarde beccafico \u0026 stuffed zucchini flowers. The pasta is homemade and cooked al dente, as it should be.\n\nMy only complaints are that they're cash only, and we had to ask for bread after being seated for a bit.\nI don't understand the negative service reviews --I left a ring there last night, called an hour after closing time, but they still answered the phone, found my ring, and put it aside for me. \n\nI'll definitely be back (and not just to pick up my  beloved octopus ring)!", "author": "Anne P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-21", "description": "I'm a neighborhood guy, grew up in the area and grew up with this place. I've eaten here pretty often in my lifetime. I've been holding off on the review hoping things would change but they have not, sadly. To start, the bartender, nice guy, could easily handle the few people at the bar. Few!, easily, but the demand of wine for the full floor keeps him from doing so. Maybe with that kinda wine demand, teach your servers to pour, and let them do so to save time, you guys have your bartender working his B@lls off for little return. Also, do something about the sound in there, put up some drapes or something, it sounds like a basketball court, feel like I'm at a Knicks game every time I go there. Generally I love the food there. The rabbit is hard to find anywhere and it's always good there, and not easy to find in NYC, so that I love, but they totally screwed my Risotto. On top of that, they had 86 two of the dishes we ordered. For a Saturday night, and the years they have been open, you would think they would have this on lock, and shouldn't have had an issue. Hopefully they work it out and I'd be happy to change my review.", "author": "Jake S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-26", "description": "Noodle Pudding is outstanding, and it hardly needs my endorsement to stay that way.  I lived in NY for 18 years and this was my neighborhood standby.  I've probably been here close to 100 times over those years and seen maybe 5 waitstaff leave, which is a testament to the good character of the owner and the loyalty people in Brooklyn Heights have to this wonderful place.  Nearly everything on the menu is excellent, but if you need to ask the question anyway, your waiter will always shoot straight.  The service is slow at times, never overly friendly, and you'll wait a while for a table.  I'd love it if they'd shut off the pointless background music and get a little more selective about the art they hang on the wall, but these are teensy gripes.  Noodle Pudding is near the top of my list of things I'll always miss about NY.  \n\nNobody comes here chasing Yelp stars, and the place won't suffer if I do my part to keep it somewhat of a secret, thus 3 stars.", "author": "Ryan S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-09", "description": "I came here with my family while they were visiting me in NY. We planned out a schedule for dinner each night but the last, saving that night for a return trip to our favorite place of the week. We unanimously voted on returning to Noodle Pudding.\n\nThe staff was delightful, and the mood of the restaurant had such an authentic feel to it. It felt like being at home.\n\nAnd then the food. So. So. Good. The fish! The vegetables! The pasta! I would have been happy with just the bread and olive oil they served up before the meal. I would recommend ordering family style so everyone can taste everything. Highlights were the diver scallops wrapped in pancetta and the bruschetta al Ischitana, as well as the blowfish, shrimp linguini... and everything else we ate. For dessert we ordered four things (espresso cake and panna cotta stood out) for the table and it was the most heavenly 10 minutes of our entire trip.\n\nI also highly appreciated their wine selection, including the $15 bottle on the menu. I would recommend putting the $30 you save by ordering that for the table toward a filet of the fresh-caught fish of the day. Fish that good is a rarity.

Its something that can easily come out rubbery and gross if not done right, but they do it perfectly, its incredible. I got a mushroom ravioli that was over-the-top delicious; very mushroomy with lots of other little flavors darting in and out.

Sad face.\n\nImagine a party of two on a Saturday night. We give our name to one of the staff members who tells us it will be a thirty minute wait, which was more or less accurate. There is nowhere to sit outside and wait. Your options are the street curb or on top of someone else's car. What are you left with? Standing and watching people eat their food. \n\nSo we wait, we get seated. Our server is very knowledgeable about the menu. We order the golden beet salad that comes with olives, the hand rolled whole wheat pennette dish, and a pasta dish with sausage and veggies on the specials menu.  Before our meal arrived, we were served a small portion of bread with some olive dip. Now, that was pretty good. The salad was gross. Something was not right. Ew. My whole wheat pasta dish tasted a bit undercooked (or maybe the texture is that way because of being whole wheat?) and my date's dish was pretty good (I had a little taste of the pasta and he finished his plate).\n\nIn the middle of our discussion (not recommended at this joint as the noise level is loud), two male staff members got into a verbal argument. I am not joking. I couldn't quite make what happened but one staff member threatened to physically assault the other one. Very unprofessional. The two were separated but later on one staff member (who is probably either the manager or floor manager or something) decides for the two men to explain what happened...INSIDE the restaurant. Wouldn't it be common sense to take it outside and discuss?! So more yelling, angry faces, finger pointing, etc. Needless to say, one of those guys was our server and we didn't see him again that night. \n\nOverall, we were disappointed. Boo. \n\nOh, and P.S. Do not celebrate your birthday there or just don't let them know it is your birthday. The staff singing Happy Birthday is painful to your ears.

We went early (like 5:30 on a Saturday) and elected to sit near the open window, which allowed for some enjoyable people watching.\n\nWe ordered garlic bread to start (we were starving) and I got the perfectly cooked gnocchi with butter and sage for my main.  Had a glass of the Penedes with dinner and another with Tiramisu for dessert.  I'm a bit of a tiramisu connoisseur and this was good but didn't knock my socks off.  Definitely a heavy, carby meal, but sometimes that's just what you're in the mood for.  I think this would be a great mid-winter place.\n\nService was good for most of the meal, but our guy kind of disappeared toward the end.  We waited a long time to get a receipt (this was technically business travel, so could have expensed it) and then he eventually just brought back change and ran off before we realized there was STILL no receipt.  Rather than wait another 20 minutes for him to orbit back, we just left.  Oh well.  Still a nice experience.

Now, since it was a Friday night and we were a party of 10, I probably should have called ahead...whoops!  But they took my name down and told me to be back in an hour.  Cut to an hour later, we are seated at a table in this lovely establishment full of candlelight and rough-hewn wood and we order our food.  \n\nAt this point, we felt a little ignored by the staff who neither seemed to acknowledge us or give us updates on our food or whether it would ever actually make it to our table...but to be fair they did supply us with a lot of delicious bread and an accompanying amazing infused olive oil.  \n\nFinally, the moment arrived when our food emerged steaming from the kitchen, and the group saw it and saw that it was good.  About half the table got the gnocchi with butter and sage, but I'm gonna say that my rigatoni with eggplant and ricotta on top was friggin amazing.  I don't know what they did to the eggplant but it was killer and had I not eaten so much bread beforehand I would have loved a second plate!  \n\nThen, since it was my birthday and all, my friends told the kitchen to bring their flourless chocolate cake topped with espresso ice cream...yeah just let that one sink in for a sec...which was brought to me by two waiters with surprisingly good singing voices.  The cake was amazingg, more like a chocolate mousse than a cake, and obviously dripping with espresso ice cream is really how any dessert should be served.  YUM.  \n\nSo, despite the slowww service and weirdo name that doesn't sound Italian, Noodle Pudding's food and delightful ambience win it 4 whole stars!", "author": "Maeve C."}], "servesCuisine": "Italian", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Noodle Pudding", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "38 Henry St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ha7iGEA0T9nmPsmWwuLGYg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17186253737"}
