Could've been a lot better had there been effort put into it.. edamame were ice cold and flavorless and I ordered the spicy ones. One server had an apron on and was running and on top of her game. My server however looked like she was about to go out and trying to rush us out. She never came to check on us and she barely said two words to us. Had to ask busser for water and utensils and refills etc. extremely annoying to be honest. Music kept changing mid song, pick a playlist and stick to it. Take the auxiliary cord away from the jack ass playing his phone. Automatic gratuity is not deserved, I almost didn't even want to leave a tip because the waitress was so bad, but I was forced too??? Train your employees, the game is hospitality. There is none to be found here.", "author": "Sal P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-28", "description": "Great food, they have 2 big bars.

I came on a Friday night after work with a few friends and the food was spot on! The Nachos and the Korean wings are awesome. The parmesan truffle fries are good but they were a bit crispy. The drinks are absolutely wonderful and fulfilled my expectations!

We went here for my friends 30th bday ( big deal, well to us). Disappointed is an understatement. Let me start by saying that the view is really nice, atmosphere and vibe cool. The DJs were really good, so I will recommend going there for the music and vibe. When it comes to food and drinks, save your money and energy. I was mostly put off by the service. We had a party of 10. We all put in our orders. When the food came out, I was missing my dish. I waited more than an hour after all my friends ate there dinner. Even though the manager took care of the issue, I was not please. Then come the drinks, I am convinced these people add water to all their drinks. To the point where you can taste that the drink is watered down. Just unethical. Also before the dinner I called to ask if it was alright to bring a cake to surprise my friend. I was told they have a $25 charge for all outside cakes( like sis that's the price of the cake), that alone should have been a warning. I'm sure there are people who have better experiences from here. But I can not say the same for myself. I won't recommend this for food and drinks to people I care about, hence I won't recommend it to you all.

When she returned, I ordered a specialty roll, the Harujuku ($15) as well as Chicken Gyoza dumplings ($8).\nThe beer was very good and I was glad to drink local.\nThe dumplings were way too crispy and dry for my preference.\nThe roll was pretty, but lacked much flavor. And for $15, I would expect so much more.\nThe server didn't return and I had to seek her out to pay so I could go.\nI'd return any time for the views and a night out with friends.

Nice atmosphere and decor. Although there's many good things to say, bad interactions leave a lasting impression. The manager was receiving a complaint from a patron and it was getting heated, my incident was with the bartender. I had bought many drinks with coworkers and simply asked for water, to my surprise she completely ignored not once, but 3 times. I had to ask the manager why that was and he said \"I don't have the patience for this now\". Given the heated complaint before, I get it and it's tough going complaint to complaint.

Wings are like 25 cents a piece and they're so flavorful all three options.

Came here for the New year's Eve party and was pretty disappointed with how small and disorganized the space was. For the amount of people, the bathroom availability should be criminal.

The Korean bbq wings are a must! If you like coconut, rum and instagram worthy pics, get the Aloha! Stay away from the calamari, it didnt even taste like squidI highly advise you make a reservation before hand if you want to sit outside,it can get pretty crowded.\n\n The service was okay, I dont blame the server, it was happy hour on a Friday summer night. However, one thing that really aggravated me was how quickly the hostess sat down a white couple with no reservation. I walked in at 6:10, put my name down for a table outside and proceeded to have a drink at a hightop. 30 minutes later,I walk around to see if there were any empty tables. THERE WERE OVER 4 OPEN TABLES! I walked up to the hostess and explained what I saw,she   sat my party down with no hesitation. Now as my friend and I get sat,we see a lost couple walking around,trying to find a table. The same hostess that sat us noticed them,asked them if they had a reservation and when they said they didn't, she sat them at a table outside IMMEDIATELY! What kind of bullshit is that? \n\nMake sure to make a reservation if you're a POC or you won't get sat for a long time.", "author": "Yamii N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-01", "description": "Love the drink.
