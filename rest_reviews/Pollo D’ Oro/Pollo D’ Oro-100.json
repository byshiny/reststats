They don't offer any brunch items but do serve lunch. It was pretty empty but it could be because I arrived at 1:30 and they just opened at 1pm. \nWe ordered empanadas and 2 come in one order. So I chose one beef (which is steak) and one chicken. Even though they're fried they are not greasy. They stuffed the empanada with just the right amount of beef and chicken. Sorry as you could see I was hungry, I ate the steak empanada before I could take a picture. \nFor my entree I ordered tallarin con bistec (pesto spaghetti with steak). Served with a skirt steak and two small potatoes. The pesto sauce had such a great balance of flavors. You should definitely try it. \nFor dessert ...yes...I eat a lot...I ordered picarones. Now being that I'm peruvian I know what picarones taste like and this wasn't the best I've had.  The chancaca sauce was delicious but the actually picarone was not made with the typical dough of a picarone. I would pass on this dessert. \nOverall it was a well worth the visit. Can't wait to come back and taste other items on their menu.", "author": "Sophy G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-25", "description": "On business travel and this place by far is the best food I had during my stay in Brooklyn. The waitresses are very nice and they take good care of you. Came back after two years and the food and staff still the best around, brought the wife with me and she LOVED it as well. Pollo D' Oro never disappoints.", "author": "Jam J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-20", "description": "Until eating here, I always regarded Pio Pio on the Upper West Side as my choice pIace for Peruvian food in New York City. Pollo D'Oro is leaps and bounds ahead of the game. Their green sauce is superb and they're pretty cool about giving extra should you find yourself wanting more. The ambience is very chill. Both the service and food were excellent. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and willing to make suggestions as I pored over the menu. The tacu tacu steak dish epitomizes comfort food. It was delicious and the portions were generous. \n\nThe rib eye, cooked medium as requested, had nice flavor and was tender. The rice and beans risotto topped with fried egg along with the sweet plantains served as a nice compliment to the steak. The house sangria was tasty and packed a nice punch. This is definitely one of the best dining experiences I've had in the area. I'm looking forward to my next visit.", "author": "Roberto L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-02", "description": "First time. Group of four and we ate family style: cerviche mixto, mussels, quinoa salad, yuca fries, Maduros , hanger steak. Nice cocktails and I had the darker of the two Peruvian beers. Each of the dishes were fresh, delicious and very well balanced and well presented and the portions seemed just right. The salad was enough for the whole table. I loved the Peruvian beer and I ended with a blended Pisco on the rocks (think grappa). The pisco was smooth and so good. \n\nVery well designed interior and as it got darker outside the ambiance only got better. Very good choice of lighting to set the mood. We had Alejandra as our Waittress, friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. Great service.\n\nDefinitely go back.", "author": "Jack Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-03", "description": "I'm peruvian so I have very high standards for Peruvian food. My first experience with Pollo D Oro was a few months ago.  I had a really bad hangover and I was in need of Ceviche (the Peruvian cure for any hangover).  The fish Ceviche was freshly made, the plate itself was huge, but the portion was very little.  I left hungry and it was also overpriced to be honest. \n\nMy second experience with Pollo D Oro was today.  I ordered by phone took about 20 mins for their quarter chicken with golden tostones. The rotisserie chicken was horrible.  This chicken had no taste, no seasoning, no delicious smell, it was dry, and taste was not pleasing. It was one of the worst \"pollo a la brasa\" I have ever had and I have tried numerous restaurants.  Their green sauce was not that great.  Save your time and $$$$, please try Peruvian rotisserie chicken somewhere else.\n\nTheir empanadas don't have much flavor.  Only have chunks of meet stuffed in them. \n\n*Update - \nAnd to make things worse, I got sick from eating the chicken and the empanadas.", "author": "Arelis T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-14", "description": "I work nearby and have taken food out several times.  The food is tasty, the chicken is always well seasoned and I enjoy their empenadas.  Two issues I have are, the food is expensive for small portions and the service is inconsistent.

The 1/4 chicken lunch special includes rice \u0026 beans and a drink for $8.50 and is filling by itself.\n\nBeing my first time, I had to try the chicken empanadas as well - nice presentation and sauces.  The green side sauce is tasty and adds a hint of spice.  Yummy.\n\nThe chicken was extremely moist and tasty and the skin was perfectly seasoned.  Delicious \u0026 satisfying.\n\nMy only worry is this place seemed empty for lunch hour, so hoping they make it.  A really nice lunch spot, especially convenient for anyone working in the MetroTech center.  \nMy server was Alejandra; she was pleasant and attentive.  She also made me smile ;)\n\nOWNER: You should promote yourself at MetoTech, LOTS of hungry lunch goers right across Flatbush Avenue.  Business lunch crowd would be huge for you...

The location is in the rapidly developing neighborhood of Downtown Brooklyn, at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge.  This is a classy mix of Peruvian Food.  I have eaten in many a Peruvian home, and this food was nostalgic.  My 4 and 7 year old devoured the grilled octopus and shrimp dishes.  I tried the seafood combo and their steak and the never old or boring Lomo Saltado.  The wait staff was friendly and accommodating to kids.  The drinks were delicious (House Sangria and a Passion Pisco). \nCan't wait to return to Brooklyn and eat here again!!!", "author": "Laura O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-19", "description": "Unbelievable food and very friendly service.

The sour taste also lingered. The french fries that my husband ordered were completely undercooked. The rice I liked, the beans that went with, not so much. \n\nThe service (despite being so new) was actually quite good and I don't mind BYOB. \n\nHonestly, my stomach was a disaster post-dinner.
