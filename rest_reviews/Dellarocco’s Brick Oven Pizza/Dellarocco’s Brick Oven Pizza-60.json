Margherita pizza was wonderful As was the sausage pizza . Xhan ( pronounced John) was a terrific server. We will be back to avoid the lines at the other more famous pizza places closer to the bridge.

Cute setting. Not over priced. The service was on point. They have many options for both white and red pizza. You can eat the whole pizza by yourself and not feel like trash afterwards.

But I also didn't want to endure the shame of eating an entire large pie by myself. So I decided to try Dellaroco's personal margarita pie to-go. \n\nAnd oh, did that little pizza pack a punch. Everything about this pie was amazing -- the thin lightly burnt crust, the rich tomato sauce, the cheese. Everything.\n\nI can't wait to return and actually dine in like a real human!", "author": "Shannon G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-11", "description": "This is really the best pizza in Brooklyn.

If you don't mind the wait and want phenomenal pizza, check out Sottocasa on Atlantic Ave and Smith Street or Juliana's by the Brooklyn Bridge.", "author": "James C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-02", "description": "The pizza was good--we got the margherita and the arrabiata. The salads were good--big enough to constitute a meal, fresh, and a balance of toppings and greens. The bar a pretty well stocked with beer, wine, and liquor. The ambiance while a little sterile, can get a little cozy when the sun goes down. They have enough space for larger parties (5-7 people) which is nice if you're out with friends (but would you really be out with friends in BK Hts.?) Only downside? The place is way more expensive than it should be.\n\nI know, it's Brooklyn Hts. but that's no reason to overcharge people for mediocre food. Yes, it's good, but I've had better elsewhere. The pizza was cooked pretty well, but because the sauce is kind of runny, the slices were a little soggy in the middle once we got them. It was also about the size of a large plate. \n\nIf you are looking for a personal size pizza and don't care about price, this is a good place to go--your going to shell out at least $16 for a pizza for one. But if you don't want to spend 20 bucks on pizza for one (you won't have leftovers) find someplace else.", "author": "Shayla G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-01", "description": "I love the vibe here.

My boyfriend and I came to Brooklyn from the UWS to check out Grimaldi's however the line there was insane, so we opted to come here and honestly I'm very glad!

One of the few establishments in the neighborhood with truly delicious food. I was here with the b/f last Friday. I ordered the 4 flavor pizza and he ordered the 4 cheese pizza. Both were excellent. I'm excited to go back to have an entire zucchini pizza- SO delicious. Love the atmosphere and the service was on point. Reasonable wine prices. And what really puts the cherry on top is that the homemade tiramisu is made with mascarpone-as it should be- and it actually came dangerously close to my mother's.

The trick is to get here early so you can get a table. \n\nSome minor complaints - the draft beers could be larger.
