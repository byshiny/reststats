It superseded my expectations. I walked into applebees looking for a quick lunch and fell in love with the cowboy burger. It was well seasoned, cooked and tasty. The only thing that I can find wrong with this burger is that it was small. Everyone looking for a good burger experience should try out the cowboy burger from applebees....", "author": "SpanishBOB N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-02-24", "description": "We stopped in this place to eat because we were in the mall and it was right there. This had got be the worst food I've ever had. When our food came it was cold and taste funny. It was so bad we ate very little of it. When our waiter asked if there was something wrong and why we didn't eat,  we didn't even bother telling him and even when he asked if we wanted it to go we said no just the check. We paid left and went somewhere else to eat.

Went here last night, waited 20 minutes for a table (when they had tables open and when I approached the hostess to ask why we weren't being seated she said because if she sat us there we would be waiting a long time.  Yeah didn't matter where she sat us because when we did get seated it took the server 20 minutes to come over just for our drink order!!!! UNBELIEVABLE!  However, I have to give her credit she handled it well having lack of management who was standing in the front on his cell phone doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!  These girls/guys were running around trying to please every guest when their manager wasn't assisting he may have ran one or two plates to a table but that is all.  He never once came over to apologize for the hour wait of a hamburger!!! What the hell is the kitchen staff doing in the back???  After the food finally came out I said to the server (which I don't quite remember her name but she was really sweet) \"I have to ask you something, what is up with the service in this place? And the kitchen?\"  She proceeded to tell me that they were understaffed and without her even saying that I had a feeling that was going to be her response.  There were a lot of employees around but I don't know what their job tasks were.  Anyway, I have to say something about the music, talk about loud!!!!  My 7 year old god daughter who was with us even said the music is so loud I can't even hear myself talk!  It gave me a pounding headache which didn't help with my hunger.  Anyway - I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APPLEBEE'S AT ALL!!  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU ARE HUNGRY - THIS PLACE SUCKS! MANAGEMENT IS AWFUL, HOSTESS IS AWFUL - only nice person was the server and if I had her name, I would of posted it.  You definitely saw the frustration in her face but she held it together the best she could.", "author": "Samantha H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-10", "description": "It was ok. It is in the mall...very crowded. Manager was very attentive. Food was pretty good but they were small portions.

There was a big crowd outside the restaurant, at least five open tables inside, and a staff that didn't give a damn.\n\nAnd after we were finally seated, the service was extremely slow, and my food was cold when I received it. \n\nSo from now on, my friends and I will be avoiding Applebee's for UFC events because the poor service ruins the entire experience.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be that way. The aforementioned Buffalo Wild Wings deals with much, much bigger crowds, but is run like a well-oiled machine on UFC nights.\n\nAgain, I've never had any problems with this Applebee's during the day. \n\nBut at night? The people of Brooklyn deserve better!", "author": "Michael C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-09", "description": "This place was horrible. HORRIBLE.

It was pretty empty and the restaurant was not crowded at all. \n\n- The restaurant was a little dirty. We had to ask to have the table wiped because of a sticky substance and I found a pair of earrings and a ring on the seat cushion. It was as if no one had picked up after the previous guest.\n- The waitress was OK. We didn't know what we wanted, so we looked over the menu and the waitress acted as if we were wasting her time. Um ma'am, this is your job. You are supposed to help customers if they need help deciding. Also, she didn't listen. I specifically pointed to the advertisement for a half rack of ribs for 9.99 and she brought out a full rack which cost over $20!\n\nDidn't try any of the alcoholic beverages, so I will probably go back and see what their bar experience is about.", "author": "Brittany H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-31", "description": "We come to this Applebee's about once every 6 weeks or so. There is usually a LONG wait for a table on the weekends. Afterr you're seated the service goes pretty smoothly.

As Filipinos, my boyfriend and I consider ourselves 'people of color' and as such have dealt w/ our own issues with racism, but I personally have not been on the preferential treatment list as a result of Black on Black racism.  \n\nWell - there's a first for everything. \n\nWe came in and were promptly seated.  We ordered our drinks, appetizer, and food. Everything came out within 10 minutes. Then I began noticing the table across from us and behind us. Across from us was a group of 4 women who arrived before us. They hadn't received their food and when it did come out, the orders were wrong. Furthermore, one of the women asked for the popcorn shrimp in the sampler she ordered and was told that there was no more shrimp. Meanwhile, I got my California shrimp salad with no problems. The table behind us had to ask for menus and ask someone to take their order. Once they got a waiter - he gave them attitude after they asked why it took forever to be attended to and left the table!\n\nEVERYBODY in that restaurant that night was mostly Black, Latino, and the two Filipinos (us).  The waitstaff was all minorities too. Justifiably, the women were upset and while the waitsaff was trying to keep them from speaking to the manager - one of the women got on her cell phone and called the business line! After a heated exchange on the phone, the manager comes out and finally deals with them. \n\nToo little, too late.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a relaxed evening, turned out to be a pretty sad one.
