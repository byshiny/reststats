We had a party of 18 come in at 5:30 on a packed Friday night. Unfortunately, only downside is they don't accept reservations. We didn't mind being split into a few groups, so they split us up into 3 groups of 7, 7, and 4. THE WAIT WAS ONLY 35 MINUTES!!!! The hostess was very nice too while trying to accommodate us, never rude or short with us despite the inconvenience for her. The hostess was excellent, we were served our food in record time, and it tasted delicious. This will be a staple restaurant for me and my hubby!!!", "author": "Jacqui S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-25", "description": "FOOD POISONING!! I absolutely loved this restaurant. I've been to Joya 3 times, and my fourth time I made a long trip to Brooklyn on my lunch break from Manhattan because I was craving it... trekking long blocks from the train station rushing to make it back to work on time just to get some.. Food was delicious as per usual, until, later that night spending the wee hours of the morning on the bowl. I wouldn't wish it on anyone, because it was so horrendous, sharp pains in my stomach and being so sick. It sucks because the food is good. I just hope management looks into how the staff is cooking and cleaning and ensuring they are following all the proper health regulations... sad to say I won't EVER be eating here again. Oh, I ordered the pad see ew with rice...", "author": "Tee B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-17", "description": "The owner of this restaurant is very nasty to its patrons.

My favorite is Chicken Penang Curry, which can vary in taste slightly time to time. The Pad Thai is also great. The have an awesome outdoor area in back during the summer. These facts earn it four stars. I'm a fan. \n\nHowever, there are some things I'm not a fan of:\n\nThey should take \"delivery\" off of their menu. It's like winning the lottery if you can get someone on the phone there at night. I guess that's because the food is good and reasonably priced.  \n\nAlso, the music in the restaurant is often too loud. I don't know who is in charge of bars and restaurants that thinks obscenely loud music is what people want. Generally, I think people would enjoy talking without shouting.", "author": "James T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-07", "description": "The food was great! I got the Thai shrimp fried rice and has the shrimp rolls for appetizer and it taste so fresh, like the shrimp came right from the sea. Best Thai place I've been to in Brooklyn so far!", "author": "Takia P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-30", "description": "Best Thai Restaurant I have eaten, Great food, fast service, and always busy foot traffic. Chicken fried rice, Tiger Shrimp, Mango salad, fried Banana ice cream are all the best. I would recommend being there early to make your reservations, it's always busy and jam packed but it's well worth it. You can also Dine outside if you choose.", "author": "Benjamin N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "This is the perfect case of over relying on Yelp to pick a restaurant. The reviews are made by over-hyped bandwagon riding yuppies that don't know Thai food. This place absolutely sucks and I wish I didn't even step foot in this place. First, I walk into the restaurant with my lady and two little kids to get dinner. Great, a random couple that knows the owner I guess walks in and gets seated right in front of my face after we waited forever. I should've walked out but everyone deserves a second chance. Then the only white guy working there is a complete DOUCHEBAG, oh the irony he's the F____ing owner!!!! I had a what the f___ moment. He sees us sitting there for god knows how long then comes over and doesn't say a word and points at us to order our food. Literally not a word was said and looked at us as if we were peasants. The beef  came out with the basil sauce and tasted like throw up. The 5 pieces of beef were hard as rocks and were bland. The Pad Thai was terrible, chicken was dryer than the owner's personality. Our last entr\u00e9e, shrimp and noodles, maybe a total of 3 shrimps were on the plate and outright tested like sauteed garbage. On top of that I had to wait an hour for the food to come out and just to eat something terrible. The owner stands by the bar and drinks beer and could give 2 sh__ about your experience. You make me feel like just opening a Thai restaurant right next door so you could see how it's suppose to be done.", "author": "John N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-10", "description": "Every time I walk by this place it is always packed with a wait.  After over a year living in the 'hood I finally decided to check it out with a friend.  Is it worth the hype?! I say yes!\nWe started off with a small order of fried calamari and an order of their special spicy bbq chicken wings.  First of all, the SMALL order was HUGE, which was a pleasant surprise.... the calamari was fried perfectly and the sauce accompanying it was fantastic.  The wings were great as well.  My friend and I were tempted to lick the sauce off the plate it was so good.  For our entrees I ordered the green basil curry and he the red penang curry.  Both were super flavorful.  We couldn't get enough --  we even asked for more rice it was so good.  Needless to say I was in a full food coma less than half an hour after I got home.\nThe only downside was we were seated at the tables near the front by the bar, so it was pretty crowded and people kept bumping into my chair.  Service was a little rushed, but since there was such a long wait after us I can understand.\nWill I go back?!  YES!  Sure, the wait was long but it was some of the best food I've had in a while -- and cheap too!!", "author": "Raquel L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-03", "description": "Speedy service, cash only. The chicken wings were a bit bland, despite being covered in sauce. The Massaman chicken on pad thai noodles special was good, with flavorful sauce. My friend loved her spicy pork and pineapple fried rice but complained that there wasn't much pineapple to speak of. I wasn't as impressed as I had expected to be.", "author": "Orr R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-26", "description": "Yummy, Yummy. Great for curry fans who like spice. Sticky rice was perfect. Service was spot on. Nice prices- $50 for two people with appetizers, large portion entrees and drinks. \n\nAcoustics are cacophonous. If you don't like loud, don't come here. Twenty minute wait was doable by visiting the used book store across the street.", "author": "Maria W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-10", "description": "I get delivery from Joya all the time and I occassionally come here to dine-in. The decor is modern and hip, they have a DJ and a huge crowd on weekends, but lunch time is always a good time to go.\n\nThe food is absolutely fantastic, the best Thai food I've ever gotten (and everyone I have brought here will agree). I've yet to try something mediocre on the menu. It's also extremely cheap and the portions are huge, especially when getting delivery. This place is a must!\n\nThe only reason I can't give them 5 stars is when you're going for dinner (even on slightly slower weekdays) the service I've gotten has been absolutely horrible. I've been half way through my dinner and 3 reminders in before receiving a basic drink order, I've requested a refill on water (after having been empty for awhile) and watched the guy go and help other people and completely ignore my request. The place is also cash only and they don't have an ATM. The service complaints go on but I'll stop there and say stick to lunch or delivery for an ideal Joya experience.", "author": "Matt E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-31", "description": "Really love this place.

Low lighting, decent crowd great Thai food. We ordered calamari and chicken spring rolls. The calamari came out fresh off the fire cooked to perfection, but as soon as we tasted it we realized it had ZERO flavor..sad day. But we were saved by their mix used in their duck sauce. Amazing stuff. Put some on the spring rolls as well..excellent appetizer choices. The chicken garlic dish was also full of flavor!!

With the view of the Christmas tree outside and the fireplace running, everyone was having a great time! And the bill came out to be less than $40. Now, that's what I call a deal!! Only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 is because the papaya salad wasn't spicy, and I like it really spicy! Also, not sure if the food is considered authentic.
