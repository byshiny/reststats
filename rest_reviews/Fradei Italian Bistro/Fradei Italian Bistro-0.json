Had to give one star off because they were playing really bad 90's hits. \n\nThe portions are small but FULL of flavor. You could tell the pasta was made fresh- practically melts in your mouth! Worth the price but might not leave you full. Great wine list. A little light for dinner for me, but a great spot for lunch.", "author": "Lisa B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-20", "description": "Tucked down a couple of steps on South Portland, Fradei is a cozy... (and cozy by bklyn standards), restaurant - maybe 30 seats in total? I definitely appreciate the intimacy of the space. \n\nService? Great.\nMusic? So-so.\nFlavors? Very good.\nPortion? Small.\nTiramisu? Awesome.\n\nTo give some perspective, (and this is totally my personal opinion)... in Fort Greene, this place rates 4.0-4.5 stars... a neighborhood like Williamsburg, I'm leaning more toward 3.5-4 stars. \n\nI'm all for smaller portions, but these portions were quite tiny. I left hungry and this was after 2 appetizers, 2 mains, glass of wine, dessert and espresso. There were 2 of us dining. \n\nAll in all, Fradei is a good spot - we enjoyed it. There are just a few things to beef up on that would make this a solid restaurant in the neighborhood.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- Menu changes every two weeks\n- Walk-In's only\n- Their Tiramisu is excellent\n- Very personable \u0026 small staff\n- Portions are small\n- Typical menu will have about 3 starters \u0026 about 5 or so mains. If you're into a glutinous menu, go elsewhere.", "author": "Tara C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-31", "description": "I have never eaten here but wanted to try it  and I won't at this point. I have spent the better part of the past half hour trying to find a menu or phone numeber for this place. No dice and it shouldn't require college level research to find a menu or phone number anywhere online.

Stopped in after seeing that this place was opened only to be met with a micro-aggressive bartender and a preoccupied staff that were busy chatting up their buddies.  Food mediocre as well as the wine.  Won't be back.  I blame Trump \u200d.

If it's not for me, I just move on, no need to waste everyone's time. \n\nUnfortunately, this was one of the worst restaurants I've ever eaten in. Basically steak covered in bbq sauce, and even though it was a skirt steak (perhaps the most modest of cuts above stew meat) there was not enough of it. \n\nWorst of all, they must have recently paid a visit to Trader Joe's wine shop because I didn't think wine ever got this bad. In the last 20 years of living in nyc I'm not sure I've ever left a bottle on the table, but I literally couldn't take any more of it. \n\nWhile the service was not my style, the waiter was attentive. \n\nIf your one of the losers who recently moved to Brooklyn and live in one of those over priced dorm rooms that pass for apartments now, this will be a new favorite of yours. They have orange wine!", "author": "John S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-17", "description": "Great wine, great atmosphere, great food and great service.  This place is run by the guys that actually own it and you can easily tell how much passion they have for what they do.  The menu is seasonal and constantly changing, and when it comes to the wine they REALLY know their stuff.\n\nI was there the other night when Yolande B came in and I watched her write that bogus review.  You can ignore it.  The only attitude was her own, as she sat at the bar with a sour look on her face and her headphones on.  Give us a break lady!\n\nAlso, anyone who claims the wine selection is anything other than top notch, clearly doesn't know anything about good wine.  Like the food, the wine selection is constantly changing and these guys are sommeliers, though I doubt that reviewers like Rachel S. or John S. even know what a sommelier is, hahaha...\n\nAs the other reviews say, Fradei is very cozy, so to all the haters out there- please don't go back so that there is more room for those of us that know and love a good thing when we experience it!", "author": "Bleecker W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-24", "description": "This meal was absolutely phenomenal, you should go. \n\nMy boyfriend passes this place every weekday and noticed that the atmosphere was lovely and everyone was having a good time, so we decided to check it out when we got hungry a little early on Saturday night. We showed up at 6:45 and luckily were seated right away because there was one open 2-top table left (it's a no-reservation place, and just a few tables). Several parties who arrived after us had to wait or sit at the bar before a table opened up; keep that in mind with planning, unless you're happy to wait a while.\n\nOur waiter was so great, and recommended a wine based on our tastes that was quite delicious. Because their menu changes often, I'm not going to go into the specific dishes but every dish we had was so unbelievably good. The pasta was lovely and delicate, everything came out perfectly seasoned. Each bite was absolutely worth savoring, and it was served in the perfect amount - I usually have leftovers when going out to eat, but here we returned all our plates completely clean.\n\nOur tiramisu was also delicious, the cream was fresh and rich, the espresso not too bitter, the whole dish not too sweet.\n\nBecause it was difficult to find prices online before coming to Fradei, I think it's helpful to know that with our two glasses of white wine, a shared appetizer, two reasonable entrees, and a shared dessert, our meal was ~$100 before tip.\n\nCheck this place out soon, I can imagine it becoming so popular that it's impossible to get a table!", "author": "Amy A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-28", "description": "Food is excellent, but very small portions.

I can't believe they can charge $26 for a small Octopus tentacle. this dish should cost $13 max. We couldn't get a wine list because the servers are the wine list. Cute but I still need to see my choices. My date and I were so hungry, we decided on dessert. Sorry 3 scoops of Mascarpone cheese sprinkled with Matcha powder does not make a Matcha cheesecake.

Much smaller portions than jean George but same price. They need to add a protein course fish or beef so you don't leave hungry. Olmstead and Oxalis and Locanda Vini \u0026 oili make the grade in this area for this price range.. also they do this thing where there's no wine list and they say we're the wine list.
