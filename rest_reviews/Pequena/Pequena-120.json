My meal over the summer was tasty but didn't leave me filled, and the service was alright.\nMy meal from two weeks ago was spot on. I got the fish tacos (my first fish tacos at any restaurant) and the chicken enchiladas (what can I say, I was hun-gry). The cool thing about Pequena is you can order the dishes as appetizers or as main dishes with rice and beans. \nDrinks are good too. The place is small and can fill up fast (so no large groups and please leave the suv stroller at home) but worth it.", "author": "Chey H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-08", "description": "It's aiight...  but not as good as I had hoped.\n\nSpace:  Small (it's called Pequena, right?) and kind of clumsily (stereotypically) Mexican themed.  Lots of strange things hanging from the ceiling... (there was also water dripping on my back from an A/C duct on the ceiling).  Everything felt a little sticky/\"grubby\" (just like in Mexico?).\n\nFood/Drink:  I went for lunch and I have to say the price is right.  $7-9 bucks for the entrees (and $5 (regular or flavored) margaritas!).  I had the (vegetarian) mushroom torta which was actually very good and accompanied by chips and either pico de gallo salsa or guacamole.  My partner and I got one of each and shared.  They do not skimp on the guac!  The margaritas were ok, but must be premixed as they came out super fast and despite the ice, the liquid itself was still warmish.\n\nService:  Fine... nothing over the top, but sufficient.\n\nWould I go again?  For lunch, possibly... but not sure the price/value/ambiance proposition makes sense for dinner.", "author": "Kevin F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-29", "description": "This little joint right near my apartment is a great place to grab Mexican brunch, which is difficult to find in this fair city of ours.  Fair prices, good quality ingredients, and friendly service.  Cafe con leche was strong and hit the spot.  The egg pan was delicious with plantains, refried beans, avocado and chorizo with hot tortillas to roll everything up.  Add some Cholula sauce, and it's a hearty brunch that'll keep you full until dinner!\n\nCash only.", "author": "Dee S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-14", "description": "This little spot has become a weekend staple for me. The food is really fresh (from the guacamole to the tortillas and black beans) and it's not overpriced. \nThey are a member of the BAM restaurant group, too, so if you have a BAM membership you can get 10% off your bill. Only thing that isn't great is they don't take credit cards. Just cash.

It was so bad that the guy in the kitchen laughed.\nWe should've left but figured, hey we all have bad moments so we let it go. The food was OK. It probably would've been better if we had enjoyed our experience. We also found a piece of plastic in our chips, but I picked it up and put it aside. It shouldn't have been there but it wasn't like a bug or something so we didn't even mention it to them. \nLater, the same woman picks up our plates, and she does so so carelessly that the fork falls on my boyfriend's lap, spilling black bean all over his shorts and shirt. smh. Again, it happens. She asked if she could bring seltzer, and offered a free dessert, but we really at this point wanted to get out of there. \nHe also had to ask her for a bag to put our takeout in. \nBasic service lacking from this poor woman who obviously doesn't want to be working there. Someone give her a job in whatever she really wants to do! \nThe other people who worked there seemed very nice so it's unfortunate that we dealt with her and that leads to this review, to ensure others don't have to.", "author": "Kat I."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-09", "description": "What happened to your margarita? I've been coming here for over five years to enjoy delicious margaritas. They're consistent, flavorful and they're a classic margarita. The other day I had a margarita that gave me a headache. It tasted disgusting, was all lime, and tasted like roses lime juice or lime concentrate.

The servers were also really sweet.  I wasn't feeling well and ordered a small scrambled eggs dish--the green eggs and jamon, with bacon--which was fine but nothing extraordinary.  But I have a feeling I misordered.  My friend's burrito looked amazing and I had lots of food envy for other tables.  I also must note that the coffee was quite tasty and free-flowing!  They only had margaritas and sangria (and we had our hearts set on bloody marias) but honestly that's a minor point to quibble with since the margs were pretty good.  I will definitely be back.

Ever time I go to brunch somewhere else I think: \"This is really good, but I'd rather be at Pequena.\" It is also beyond me that anyone would order anything other then the  \"Pan C\" ($6) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KtzxoHCm9N9QJi31TNjbhw?select=cbeT57_iTq6bzcdW0hizjA - it's a small pan of sweet plantains, black beans, 2 fried eggs, queso fresco, and fresh salsa, served with 3 corn tortilla. I then drown it all in half a bottle of Cholula (because it is the greatest hot sauce on earth) and chow down. My friends like the Breakfast Burrito Challenge ($6.5) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/KtzxoHCm9N9QJi31TNjbhw?select=M_ON9uj8MGESeiE8iUup0A - no one can eat the whole thing in one sitting, but it tastes so good that you really really want to. \n\nThe staff is very friendly, a table for 3 will probably be a table for 2 with an extra chair, and they make a mean caf\u00e9 con leche!
