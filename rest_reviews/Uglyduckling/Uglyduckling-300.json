We asked for the back table because it was a hot day and they had the doors open.  \n\nThere is an extensive list of craft beers on draft, but we weren't drinking.\n\nI wasn't too hungry so ordered the mussels, he had the seared ahi burger.  The waitress was nice, didn't spend much time with us.  My mussels were good.  It was a good sized order for an appetizer.  There was a lot of garlic (I spent the rest of the day smelling).  His burger was served with fries.  Unfortunately it wasn't an ahi steak, but a patty of ground ahi.  It was, however, not overcooked.  \n\nAll in all it was a decent meal.  Not the best and not the worst.

We had a total of six people but when we got there, they didn't have a table that would fit us. The owner came over to us and offered the first round of drinks on the house (what??). \n\nAfter waiting which seemed like forever (we were all very hungry), the food finally came. The owner gave us a free salad for the long wait which was super nice because he didn't have to do that. \n\nThe food was delicious! I ordered the steak frites. It was tender and the sauce went well with it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was super fluffy, the chicken was moist and crispy. The chicken and waffles came with a spicy aioli and it is SUPER DELICIOUS!\n\nI cannot wait to go back! :)", "author": "Karol L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-12", "description": "A lot of beer on tap and a lot of food choices. Got the delicious deviled eggs and mussels for appetizers. Both were good. The chicken and waffles were a bit disappointing. Our waffle was so soft and not crispy. Flavor was good. Chicken had a lot of flavor but it comes with one little piece. At least ours was. The lobster sandwich was okay. The lobster part was good but the bacon was too overpowering. I had to separate the sandwich and just eat the lobster.", "author": "Elizabeth N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-04", "description": "AMAZING!\n\nChicken and waffles are a must..

Great atmosphere - the space manages to avoid the overcrowding that you get with seemingly every restaurant in New York. We sat at the bar and received outstanding service from the bartender, Ryan. Maybe he knew about our shared name? Probably not, but he was great anyway. I had a plate of ribs and my wife had the salmon BLT. Both were excellent. The ribs were falling off the bone, had great flavor, and were combined with tasty sauce. The beer menu rocked. I think they had close to 30 beers on tap and offered samples of anything we were interested in trying. Finally, the place stayed open well past closing time to appease the sports fans and the random walk-ins. Overall, great experience and we will definitely be returning in the future.", "author": "Ryan V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-10", "description": "The Ugly Duckling is a fitting name. The atmosphere is deceiving. Everything sucks big time. How can you mess up twice serving hot milk for coffee? Our food came out cold. But then again, maybe I'm wrong, cold poached eggs might be a new trend. Half the menu was unavailable. Small portions, big prices. Rude hostesses and service. \n\nSave your money and go somewhere else. Even McDonald's does better breakfast!!", "author": "R P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-03", "description": "I didn't know what to expect - but the name was very catchy. I came in for Sunday brunch - the restaurant was packed. However the wait was under 5 min. \nThe ambiance is great - very low key and bar like feel.

I like to make sure that the food and service is consistent across the board. I ONLY review places that's worth my time. \n\nThe food here is amazing! I had the chicken and waffles during brunch, and I was impressed. The waffles are thinner  but still so delicious. They are so delicious you probably don't need to add the syrup to it. The chicken is actually chicken breast. It's favorable and I'm not sure how its prepared but it's well seasoned. NOT SALTY or GREASY!\n\nThe staff is professional and welcoming. I felt relaxed and at home the whole time. The bartender Candice was awesomce.

They took the pulled pork sandwich off the menu which was my favorite dish there.  They also changed the french fries.  They use to serve a mix of plain and sweet potato fries, I preferred just the plain. They have now switched to just plain fries BUT they are seasoned with rosemary and parmesan cheese.  Who puts rosemary on french fries???  I was thinking of ordering the short rib sandwich.  I tried to order it with no cheese but the waitress said it can't be ordered htat way because the chef said it would fall apart.  Sounds crazy but she said he would not make it w/o cheese.

I got the chicken waffles. I think the waffles were pretty good, i like how it's softer than most places I've had it at. However, the chicken was slightly over fried so it gets lower ratings for that.

I had some friends in the area and we wanted to catch the football game,  so thought it'd be the perfect opportunity to give it a try! Not going to lie, I had gone in with low expectations, sort of expecting your typical bar food, however, was pleasantly surprised! \n\nThe menu has a wide variety- from healthy to artery-clogging. I was starving and after a long day at work, had a craving for comfort food. I started with the ugly poutine which was delicious! Definitely, not your typical poutine, but I loved how the BBQ paired with the duck confit and provolone-- mMm, we were having fork wars over who got the last bite. For my main, I got the chicken \u0026 waffles- the chicken was very well-seasoned, fried to perfection and was so flavorful! \n\nThe service was great. I can't remember the name of my cocktail, but it tasted like juice which was dangerous. I don't doubt that I will come back for the poutine \u0026 chicken \u0026 waffles.", "author": "Kayla C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-23", "description": "Music was blasting way too loud to enjoy dinner. \n\nExcellent beer selection! That I DID like. Server was nice, too. 2 stars solely for these reasons. \n\nFood I did NOT like. Zero stars. \n\nThe steak was awful. It was seasoned with a ton of ASIAN spices (lots of soy sauce) and was way too salty. It's not what you'd except for a dish with a FRENCH name. Steak frites should just be a simply cooked steak last time I checked, not Korean BBQ beef. They obviously used poor quality meat; It was super tough; the chefs were probably trying to mask the crappy meat with the soy sauce and god knows what else. Well, we noticed and it sucked.

The chicken \u0026 waffles are absolutely to die for.. my husband had tacos \u0026 he really enjoyed those. Unfortunately the service is lacking big time \u0026 half the time they don't have advertised cocktails which is a bit disappointing especially for a sangria lover. On the other hand if you're a beer drinker this is definitely the place you want to try since they have tons and tons of beers on tap.

Nice trendy, rustic decor.  The bar is pretty big and takes up half of the restaurant.  They have 4 tvs if you want to catch the game that are visible from almost any seat.\n\nWe had the fried pickles which were awesome.  Big portion with a delicious BBQ ranch dipping sauce.  We also had the salmon BLT with shoestring fries.  The BLT was also delicious.  Nice, soft roll. Decent piece of salmon. Great lemon aioli.  Shoestring fries were a mix or potato and sweet potato and they were pretty good.\n\nWe are big craft beer fans and this place says it's a gastropub with 30 taps.  We were in on a Saturday late afternoon and they maybe had 20 taps working and not a single IPA! That was a disappointment.  I settled on an Oskar Blues Mamas little yellow Pils and it was great but not what I had my mind set on.\n\nI will definitely be back for the food and hopefully a better tap selection.", "author": "Paul G."}], "servesCuisine": "American (Traditional)", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Uglyduckling", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "166 Smith St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/C1lGcRxbITOSR2hDs9o5JA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17184513825"}
