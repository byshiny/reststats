I came when there was barely anyone here. Our drinks took forever and when we finally got them, the drinks were the wrong ones!! And then our actual order took even longer and when we got the bill they charged me for the wrong order and my actual order. Save your money and go to literally any other bar.", "author": "Ava H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-16", "description": "Had a great time.

Quickly yelped outdoor spot and landed across this gem!! Very interesting Japanese beers so we tried out a few and had the aioli fries (perfect to pick at). \n\n\nOur server, Miguel, was really very friendly and helped us out on our itinerary for the rest of the night. We had questions...and he had the answers! He was very attentive and was just very welcoming. We asked about the music, and 5 minutes later out came the dj. This dj spun old school raggae, rap, hip hop! Really wish we could have stayed longer, but we had to head back to jersey!\n\nThank you kimoto!", "author": "Jennifer B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-30", "description": "Greattt food and drinks!! Went there on Sunday and the views are amazing!? The prices were reasonable for a rooftop spot and everyone was very nice", "author": "Sam D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-12", "description": "This place was so much fun! My friend and I had a really comfy couch and table to ourselves with a nice sunset view of the Brooklyn borough. The fried rice and the mermaid roll were to die for!! AND they were playing really good music (including Justin Timberlake ;) ) I literally wish I could have the food everyday. The only downside is that our waitress was pretty inattentive and we had to approach her at her computer stand all three times we needed something. But it wasn't really too big of a let down since we were so focused on the amazing food! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone :)", "author": "Macys D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-08", "description": "Discriminate/segregated \n\nThe overall service was great, a little slow though. However, I didn't like that the rooftop bar was segregated. It appeared as if they seated all the white people in one section and everyone else in another section. When I addressed the hostess about this she stated \"sometimes I've been screwed over in the past, so sometimes I seat certain people place!\" I asked what does that have to do with anything and not allowing us access or informing us about the seating outside. We spent well over 100 dollars in this establishment. I would not personally recommend it.", "author": "Nunu E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-24", "description": "Stumbled upon Kimoto when searching for a spot to grab Happy Hour with a friend. I believe that I have been to this Venue a few years ago when it was a night lounge but it seems that they have remodeled it and it looks great. There's a bar to sit at, tables for inside dining, and then an outside area to eat or just enjoy the views. They don't have table service for the outside seats so you'll have to order food at the bar and then take it outside yourself. \nThey have a relatively cheap happy hour m-f, and then additional specials for each specific day of the week. We opted to get a margarita pitcher which was the special for the day and it was really strong. \nFor food, we ordered the soy garlic wings which were not as good as I expected. I've had soy garlic at other Asian themed eateries that were much better, these were just off. We also ordered some truffle fries which were delicious, and the mermaid sushi roll which had shrimp tempura and caviar, and it was my favorite food of the evening. \nI will def come back here for happy hour and maybe on a weekend, where they supposedly have a DJ. They also have hookah available but it is a little pricey.", "author": "Robin T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-07", "description": "Cool nice chill spot. Good for parties or dates. Food is incredibly tasty! And the prices are reasonable. Came in the winter and where I was sitting was a bit crafty but I bet the summer is perfect. The service can be improved a little just being a bit more attentive.

Like- they'll post pictures on their instagram stories with a caption like \"we out here\" and the view looks -eh- somewhat cool? Yeah this is that place. \n\nMy friend (bless her soul) picked this place out to celebrate her birthday. She made a reservation for a party of 10. When we arrived they gave us these two tiny love seats- for 10 people! Not only that but they were situated at opposite ends of the outside patio. Someone is clearly SO smart. We ordered a pitcher of the Jalape\u00f1o-Pineapple margarita, two beers and a rum and coke. 30 MINUTES later still no drinks! Some people ordered food and that dream was quickly dashed. Myself and another friend went to our waitress to cancel the entire order since we had decided to leave but unluckily for us she was heading our way with our drink orders. Im not going to complain about the drink- it was mediocre at best- but we were paying for it and that meant I was definitely downing that acidic crap. We cancelled anything else that hadn't arrived at the time and headed to a beer garden where we were promptly seated and served all the food and beer we desired. \n\nThe end.", "author": "Jessy C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-19", "description": "Love all their roll specials and the weekly specials are a good deal.

However I hate that people are smoking Hookah right in the middle of all the other customers that don't want to inhale all that. I get it, people have the right to do what they want but anyone who wants to do hookah smoking should have an area away from other customers that don't want to be exposed to that. Their website doesn't even advertise Hookah smoking however don't be surprised to see a bunch of people smoking hookah indoors.

I'd love to visit on a sunny day to enjoy the rooftop properly. The Manager Jonny was extremely attentive and gave our a group a lot of his time. He even arranged for a special cocktail for the birthday girl that has a flower which dissolves when he poured the alcohol in. The DJ dropped some dope tunes and although I didn't eat anything there as it was far too late from me, several of the items on the menu looked tempting. Definitely need a follow up visit, the Manager was telling me Monday and Tuesday nights they broadcast sports.\n\nAs I was leaving noticed the size of the bouncers, looking at the size of them I'd assume they have sampled all the dishes on the bar menu!", "author": "Victor A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-26", "description": "I had a wonderful time celebrating my best friends birthday here. I would like to give a special shout to Susie who made our night soooo special. She was very pleasant and honest and she made us feel extremely comfortable. Sasha was also very helpful in making sure we had a really good spot to sit and enjoy our tasty drinks and hookah and food. The DJ was really good and played songs everyone was able to sing along to and dance to. The new Hostess Amaya was also very sweet and honest with us about happy hour specials as we were told by another employer that happy hour wasnt happening and it was.
