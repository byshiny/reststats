They have almost an overwhelming amount of options. I got the salted caramel slice for myself and red velvet for my brother. Both were amazing! The salted caramel was one of the best desserts I have ever had. They also have a nice seating area. Would 100% recommend if you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth or a place to chat with a friend!", "author": "Mary C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-25", "description": "This place was excellent! So happy they have late hours so perfect place to catch dessert after dinner or a show. The bakery had a very extensive variety of pastries, cakes, macaroons, and more! Very tall layered cakes and decadent cheesecakes. Beautifully and artfully presented gives these desserts added flair. My dad decided to try the Nutella layered cake, which was absolutely delicious. It wasn't too sweet which was a plus and the crunchy layer added yummy texture to the cake. We also tried the apple cheesecake. True to it's name was a beautiful blend of cheesecake, apples, and cinnamon crumble. Last but not least, we took home a slice of Flan. THAT was so lovely. Like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but without the crusted sugar top. The custard cake practically melts in your mouth and the syrup topping was again not too sweet and overpowering.

I settled for the coconut cake and an Oreo cupcake to wash it all down (because I'm a winner.)\n\nThe coconut cream pie was tasty but nothing to write home about, though that could just be because I was in that coconut cream pie mood. The Oreo cupcake was also yummy but the frosting was cold and firm. \n\nAll and all, Mia's was just what I needed that day though I'd love to see them take their desserts to the next level.", "author": "Shannon G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-03", "description": "My wife and I live near Mia's, and since it opened it has become a go-to for us. The pastries, baked goods, and staff are all excellent. When my parents were in town I brought them there after dinner one night; they loved it and wanted to go back the next night. (It probably didn't hurt that the owner gave them a free cookie.) And when we ordered cupcakes from them for our wedding, the owner delivered them himself, even helping get them--and another dessert from another place!--set up. They also seem like they pride themselves on being part of the community.\n\nI don't write many Yelp reviews, but wanted to do so for this place. They're well worth the time.", "author": "Jeremy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-05", "description": "Amazing amazing amazing . It has like every dessert possible ! So yummy ! I had the vanilla bean cake and it was just so good . It was very moist and it wasn't sweet . I brought some home to my mum and she ate it . She doesn't like cake so that says a lot lol . My best friend had the fudge brownie which was so Fudgy and yummy . Every girls dream this place lol . I can tell this business is family owned and the owner I think was walking around seeing how we were enjoying our dessert which was really nice . You will enjoy this place . Go now lol", "author": "Chelsea P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-13", "description": "If you despair at the thought of big, fluffy, tasteless cakes that often make appearances at parties and events, Mia's is your salvation. The cakes are truly delicious, big enough to share but not so big that they'll colonize part of your fridge. They are dense and toothsome, flavorful and sweet-but-not-too-sweet. My girlfriend immediately fell in love after trying one for the first time, and now I even get one to bring to Seattle when I fly out to visit her. It's a hassle to take care of a cake through the ordeal of flying, but it's worth it to see her smile when she takes a bite of Mia's. She knows she won't find a replacement anywhere else.\n\nBuy your next cake here. It'll be just the thing.", "author": "Bernard S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-26", "description": "This is the best bakery I have ever been too!

They were so awesome. My family really enjoyed the pumpkin pie and the cheesecake; the crust was soft and flaky; the pumpkin was hands down the best one I have ever tried.

(Coming soon)\nIt's important to have the dialogue to help each other service needs of patron and owners.\nGreat move on their behalf for reaching out. Much appreciated. Looking forward. \n\nPast review: Here we go again. Left a better review before but after repeatedly not having brown sugar and messy bathroom. done. No changes. Today asked for small gesture from employee, she seemed to be manager) was rude. When I pointed out how to keep a regular customer happy, she stood her ground and told me I am fortunate that she doesn't charge me for staying when I ask for a to go cup. \n\nAlso cleaning mirrors spraying chemicals near my head and small boy eating near by.

Please note: you have to ask them too warm it up, as they I'll not automatically do so.

They had a weird taste and were just not good at all. Those rainbow cookies deserve one star.
