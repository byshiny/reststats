The great thing about NY is ordering by the slice but you can only order pies here and they only accept cash. It is in a new location and for the crowd it gets it's still so tiny. Expensive and a tourist site. Not worth it as a local. Better smaller pizzerias at better prices. People were pretty rude. Just b/c it's NYC doesn't mean it's rude. Great thing about Brooklyn from other boroughs is it's more personal and we take great pride in our neighborhoods. This pizzeria, very commercial and disconnected.

When it finally came i was more mad than hungry and.. the crust was burnt! Damn you for burning my favorite part!!!!! \nService was okay. I just hate it when a place gets so popular the waiters seriously thinks it excusable to have patrons wait an hour and when ask they respond with \"That's how it is\" WTF? Be professional, Lie to me that you'll check it at least. I should not have to tip you for that kind of BS response. Pretend to check my goddamn pizza and lie about how much longer i would have to wait! \nIt gave me a inkling of how good this pizza could have been but what a let down. Pizza is a simple thing, That's why people love it, With all that wait, bullshit and in the end i get pizza that's soggy at the tip and burnt at the crust. I definitely had better.

RAVES about this place so I knew I had to try it and see what all the hype was about.  Grimaldi's is solid... but I didn't think it was amaaazing.  Not sure if it's worth the wait.  We came on a Friday at 2pm and there was still a crazy long line!  We waited about 45 minutes before getting seated.  Once we got seated though, from the time we ordered to the time our pizza arrived was super fast!\n\nWe got one large pepperoni, mushroom, and extra cheese pizza and one medium simple cheese pizza.  You have to eat these right away when they're piping hot!  Wait 5 minutes, and the appeal is not the same.  All the ingredients are super fresh, and if you order pepperoni you'll notice that these are not your traditional large round kind either.  They're about the size of a nickel, layered all over the pizza.  The slices were so large that I couldn't fold it without toppings sliding off, so I had to use a knife and fork.  The crust was super thin, but I wish it was crispier (like the crust at Bleecker Street Pizza).  The crust here was just too soggy for my liking.  The cheese is fresh mozzarella - it's the chewy, rubbery kind instead of the melty kind... if that makes any sense.  I'm the type that prefers the melting, oozing cheese.  There are also hints of fresh basil throughout the pizza... but I could barely taste it.  Overall, something seemed lacking about this pizza - in the end, I thought it was kind of bland and unmemorable.\n\nThere's this friendly, jolly man with a head speckled of white who was greeting all the guests, both coming and going - he was so nice that I couldn't help but ask him, \"are you Mister Grimaldi?\" as I walked out the door.  He laughed a jolly laugh and said, \"nope!  I'm just the manager\".  I couldn't help myself, I just had to ask!", "author": "Angela C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-28", "description": "If you are waiting in a long line outside of Grimaldi's for a table and you are considering this may not be worth it, just have someone hold your place and walk inside for a moment. The smell of pizza will hit you right in the face and you will know you are doing the right thing. \n\nI love the set up here, the oven is right in the dining room for all to watch. Because of this you can really take in the aroma of fresh baked pizza pies. It can be torturous as you wait for yours. I wanted to put this place to the test as we had Lombardi's just a few days prior. So I ordered the same exact pie to be fair. I also had the benefit of watching them make a pie up and close. \n\nThe fresh mozzarella is sliced and generously spread out on the pie in a circular fashion, from the edges of the pie towards the center. As I watched this master pizza maker, I couldn't help but think of a black jack dealer. Rather than cards, he was speed dealing mozzarella slices. Raw crumbled sweet Italian sausage was added next on top of each slice. I'm not sure of the reasoning, perhaps the heat of the bubbling melted cheese will help make sure the sausage is cooked all the way through. After the toppings were added, sauce was the last ingredient put on the pie. Rather than spread out evenly it was dolloped on more like a topping. \n\nBecause of how hot their coal oven is, this thin crusted pizza cooked very fast. I think the texture of the dough was the best, I've had. It had just a little bit of chew to it, so it was soft around the edges. Perhaps this pie could have stayed in the oven just a few minutes longer to pick up more of the charcoal smoke flavor, but it tasted great anyway. \n\nThe roasted red peppers were good and well marinated. I found the black olives very strong, they weren't your usual black olives. More like a Kalamata olive. They kind of overpowered the pizza in my opinion, but to each their own. We ended up taking them off. The pepperoni was of high quality and perfect. The sausage was also good, but I prefer the sliced sausage at Lombardi's. When you have crumbled sausage, you run the risk of getting a chunk of gristle. While this happened once or twice it didn't ruin my enjoyment of the pizza by any means. Also I wasn't too big a fan of baking the whole leaf basil. The basil got charred and shriveled up as it cooked. As a result, I think it lost it's flavor a bit. I think shredded is better than whole leaf basil. When you shred it, it covers more surface area of the pie, so you get a taste of it in each bite. \n\nI am nitpicking a bit, because if I only had to eat this pizza the rest of my life, I would be happy. So the complaints are more observations, rather than complaints. I give Lombardi's a slight edge, but Grimaldi's makes a great pie, and is worthy of 5 stars.", "author": "Dave G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-03-03", "description": "Over-rated, over-priced - I waited over an hour in 30 degree weather.

I'm pretty sure making the money they do they can at least open up a bigger place, instead of bumping elbows with everybody.  The ambiance is pretty garbage.  They really need to step and get someone to modernize that place.  The wait sucks balls.

Mostly just overrated for the ridiculous line..", "author": "Chad C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-02", "description": "I can proudly say I've been a New Yorker for 7 years, yet in the same breath, I can ashamedly say that until a week ago, I had never, in all that time, had a slice of the famed Grimaldi's pizza in DUMBO. And it wasn't because the line stretches around the corner at all hours. And it wasn't because I was a Manhattanite that dare not trek all the way to Brooklyn, let alone for a pie (they don't do slices, not to mention reservations, delivery, nor credit cards). And it wasn't because I don't love a great pizza. Honestly, it was because, well...I never really got around to it.\n\nAs a New Yorker, one has a laundry list of things one MUST experience (damn cultural guilt), which somehow continues to grow exponentially every day. It is our responsibility, after all, to take advantage of all that is placed at our finger tips, yes? This overload of stimuli is what attracts some and, at the same time, deflects others, from this little big city. (I am of the former breed, if you couldn't tell already.)\n\nThus, how appropriate that after living in \"the city\" (Manhattan, for those not familiar with the elitist lingo) for 7 years, it is when I become a Brooklynite (can I call myself that after moving there just under a month ago? I say yes.) - it is when this happens that I finally sink my teeth into that doughy goodness that is Grimaldi's. Consequently, it doesn't hurt that it's a 10-minute walk from my door to theirs.\n\nNow I am one that is consistently critical of hype and hoopla, especially when it concerns food. (Insert my eye roll here, thinking of my wasted time in dramatic lines at Magnolia's for an awful cupcake and Shake Shack for an \"eh, I've had better\" burger.)\n\nHowever, Grimaldi's does not fall into this overrated category of food expereince. On the contrary, it's probably better than you can ever imagine. And do you want to hear the kicker? I did not even have to wait in line! (Gasp. I know, the envy is nearly palpable.) I must have gone at one of those extremely rare off-peak hours/minutes/seconds and my eager, hungry party of three strolled right in to a table by the window. I'm fearful to divulge what day and time this was, as I do not want to lose my edge. But, okay, twist my arm. It was a Saturday evening post-10 pm.\n\nTo make a long story short (as I now have an official craving and we know delivery is not an option) it was the best damn pizza I've ever had. We ordered two pies, naturally, to try their two different types: Regular, which comes with saucy crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil; and White, which simply boasts extra mozzarella, garlic, and fresh basil (sans sauce, hence, white). To the regular we added onions, and to the white, ham and mushrooms. Excellent additions if I do say so myself. If I had one criticism, it would be that they skimped on the fresh basil, of which I can't get enough. Nonetheless, each pie was deliciously unique, tapping into two completely different palates. I could not decide which to savor as my last bite. I think I may have shoved both into my mouth at the same time; it's only fair.\n\nWith the perfect balance of flavor (thanks to fresh ingredients), the perfect pizza crust (doughy and bubbly with the slightest crunch), and the perfect company (my two favs: my mama and m'lady), I left an overly satisfied customer, ready to do it again...and wait in line a million times over.", "author": "Rebecca K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-07-08", "description": "The guy in the front are so disgusting and rude!
