Their service is amazing, the restaurant is pretty and the bread plate has some delicious marinara bread among other really good breads. I went for the prie fixe menu and for the first course, I  had the baby string beans, roasted beets and Gorgonzola. While I'm not a big fan of Gorgonzola in general, the roasted beets tasted especially nice. Has Dwight Schrute influenced my feelings towards beets? Maybe. But I digress. \nThe second course was Penne with garlic, oil and Broccoli florets. After a generous sprinkling of Parmesan and pepper, the dish is decent but has full pieces of garlic and was a little watery for my taste. \nYou'd wonder why have I given this place four stars- and I got one word for you- Dessert. \nThe delectable Chocolate Tortino stole the show and my heart. The vanilla ice cream was like velvet, the raspberry sauce sweet and tart and the Tortini itself was like biting into heaven. Needless to say, it was the table turner for an okay meal. I'd go again just for killing my diet with desserts.", "author": "Abhilasha M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-27", "description": "The food here is great.

Decided to try this place after always bypassing it on Yelp! Glad that we did. The atmosphere was welcoming and overall yielded a good vibe. We started with artichoke. I'm a sucker for a good artichoke and was happy that it was on the menu. It featured roasted garlic cloves, capers, and anchovies. Simple but amazingly delicious. Gnocchi with braised veal and baby eggplant.... superb. Nero D'Avola was a good wine choice by the glass! Michael, our server was great, accommodating, and super sweet!", "author": "Jamie C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-10", "description": "When we walked into this restaurant, I was really excited. I love old school Italian restaurants and had heard so much about this place. We were greeted by a humorous old midget Italian guy who told us it would be about twenty minutes, so we grabbed a drink at the bar while looking over the menu. Things looked promising - many classic Italian dishes on the menu. I was very excited about the vitello tonnato, as it's one of my favorite dishes that I've made many times from scratch during summers spent in Provence. We ordered it as an appetizer, along with fried zucchini. They told us just before our orders arrived that the tonnato sauce wasn't in stock and that they had made a lemon glaze in its place. I was disappointed but said OK, figuring they knew what they were doing. But no - it was horrible. The veal was sliced beautifully and paper thin, but the makeshift sauce was too tart and didn't blend well with the veal. The dish is generally made at least a day in advance to allow the veal, tuna, lemon and capers to meld properly. This was a crime against everything that dish should be. It was made haphazardly moments before and they should not have served this to anyone. They should have paid me to eat it, or even look at it. This place has been in business since the 1950s and has had plenty of time to know better. Inexcusable. This is a classic, beautiful dish. Whoever from the restaurant is reading this should get with the program and call a house meeting on this issue alone - vitello tonnato is a sacred Italian specialty dish!!! This was a travesty on my plate. Shame. Shame on you all for presenting this!!\n\nThe zucchini fries were crisp but should have had something else with them - a spicy tomato dipping sauce would have been appropriate. \n\nNext was my main course - eggplant Parmesan. Everything about this was incorrect and Marcella Shazan would have shit a brick upon just seeing it. It was a slimy blob on my plate -- too much cheese by a long shot. This is a sloppy, fat American version of eggplant parm. Shame on you all for serving this. The eggplant should be crispy, particularly at your prices. The sauce should have a kick and a zest that melds with the cheese and eggplant to form a perfect explosion of taste in your mouth. Your eggplant was slimy -- there should be no slime involved. This is a classic dish. An important dish. It shouldn't be a heavy bomb of cheese, slime and tasteless sauce. It should be MAGICAL. There is no excuse for this. None. \n\nNext was the other guest's main course, the chicken and sausage scarpariello. The meat was ok -- not tender enough but passable for a cheap American Italian. Unfortunately, you aren't cheap, so it's much less passable. The sauce was runny and there was far too much balsamic. It should have been thickened and a bit less acidic. This dish was the most passable of the lot, but still only a C grade at most.\n\nBut here is where you completely lost me. Sitting next to us were two very attractive young men. One in a t-shirt and shorts and the other in a tank top and shorts. Many other women were wearing tank tops and shorts in the restaurant, and yet you singled them out and told them to leave because of the one man's shirt. If the food wasn't far below average, I would have let it slide, but you cannot afford to lose customers, particularly beautiful ones who add to your otherwise middle aged to elderly and overweight scene. They were willing to pay for your mediocre food, and yet you kicked them out despite the fact that frumpy ladies next to them wore the exact same outfits and were left to enjoy their large portions of mediocrity. You need to adjust something - either fix your dress code to allow for both sexes to be treated equally, or adjust your menu to reflect a cuisine that was so top notch that it would give you leeway to behave like assholes. Either way, your restaurant needs beautiful people in it. This is 2016 Brooklyn, not 1958. Fix your food and get with the fucking program.", "author": "Nathan N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "Came here before RNR Brooklyn to carb up.

Some eggplant dishes can be overpowering, but this wasn't at all, and was well balanced with the tomato, garlic and other ingredients in the sauce. I love that you can pick your cut of pasta (I opted for capellini).\n\nA little expensive for what it is, but the food was good and I enjoyed my experience.\n\nSkipped dessert (though I love a good cannoli).

We made reservations and were glad that we did because it was crowded. The owner led us to our table and came back a few minutes later with menus and wine list. A server brought a plate of assorted breads and a most excellent olive oil for dipping. We ordered a nice bottle of Tuscan Red wine and would have been happy if it ended there!! But of course it didn't! We decided to forego appetizers to save room for dessert. We both ordered veal parmigiana with a side of penne. Enjoyed it immensely! For dessert, my husband chose the ricotta cheesecake (excellent) and I had Nutella gelato with fresh berries (also excellent).

They tried to split our reservation for a party of 15 into two separate tables. The dinner was for a very special family occasion with relatives who traveled from near and far. We explained that we had a reservation for 15 people for many weeks and not two reservations for tables of 8. The manager argued with us as if we were in the wrong.

I had a great beet salad, but I enjoyed the Caprese moreso because the mozzarella was really fresh. \n\nI had the veal with eggplant, it had fontina on it, but really just tasted like parmigiana, which was fine with me. Thinly pounded veal and a quality red sauce, which I have only found at a handful of places (snooty Italian, I know!). \n\nDessert was great, everyone I was with was jealous of my Tortino and regretted not ordering it. I'll admit, its confusing-Tartufo, Tortoni...but this one is basically a warm brownie with ice cream on the side , drizzled with raspberry sauce.

I wonder why this is so? Certainly not because of the food, which is superb. All of the breads, pastas, sauces and desserts  are homemade and delicious. Their steaks and veal and seafood are expertly sourced. Certainly not due to the service which is absolutely professional and pleasant. Certainly not due to the price which is not cheap but offers extraordinary value. The Prix Fixe, offered SEVEN DAYS at Queen is certainly the best deal in Brooklyn, perhaps the best deal in The City.  Certainly not due to the location, which for years has made it the Go To for the Judges, Attornies and Court Staff who work nearby or its proximity to The Heights, Carroll Gardens, Cobble and Boerum Hill. No, the reason the New Brooklynites ignore the place is due to the decor! Yes, although the place dates back 60 years, it's most recent renovation was likely in the late 80s and the place does have that Miami Vice look which just isn't gonna cut it for the New Brooklyn \"aesthetes\" who tend to only frequent places where the \"look is right\" and the owners and customers all look just like them.
