The hookah smoke was overwhelming as we walked in. We had to wait to be seated and the floors and couches looked pretty dirty. The bathrooms were definitely something to avoid. \n\nI would say the hookah was fairly priced. 10 dollars for one for two people to share. The food could have been a little cheaper based on the quality. The gelato chocolate milk shake was nearly 7 dollars and watery. \n\nHowever, mocha hookah is open 24 hours and my double cheeseburger was pretty decent.

People from countries where hookah cafes line up the streets who miss that environment and people who have spent way too much on booze and now are kicking back sobering off with some hookah. \n\nTheir hookah is pretty sub-par. It tastes synthetic. The service is incredibly slow. The place simply isn't welcoming either. \n\nThe food, however, is pretty good. That's why I give this place two stars. Order their shawarma and you won't be disappointed. The portions are incredibly generous. Their hummus isn't bad either. \n\nAlso, this place is very strict about alcohol. It isn't allowed. So, if you're looking to have some wine with that mint hookah, you're better off going to St. Mark's place.", "author": "Sherief M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-05", "description": "This place has one of the most 'blah' atmospheres compared to most hookah places, but they do make up for it with the reasonably-priced hookah. Plus, the only way to make this place 'enjoyable' is if you go with a group of friends for example, and you're already in the swing of having a good time, maybe coming here after being out to eat/drink, you're able to sit around together and laugh, etc. But no, this place doesn't have any cozy cushions or nice/pretty lights, etc. Just looks like a very plain seating area with the bakery glass display in the back. Also by the way, beware of the inflated prices on the drinks (red bull, soda, etc) - (just like most hookah places), there's a few extra dollars added to the 'normal' prices of those drinks.", "author": "Nikki S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-11", "description": "Great Service, Nice Calm Cool and Collective Place.

As far as the food...I've def had better middle eastern flair elsewhere. I don't know if it was the food or the lack of ventilation from the hookah, but I ended up throwing up as soon as I walked out and the fresh air hit me. The hookah wasn't flavorful at all...tasted mainly charcoaly...could explain the sickness. I'm from Queens, Steinway area, so I'm spoiled with good Arab food and great long lasting savory hookah.

THis place is great if you want to relax with your friends and talk and whine about college finals or things like that.\nThe hookah is very good, many different types of flavors. What people don't always know, don't ever limit yourself to one flavor. You can always mix and match, personally I think everything is good with mint.\nSometimes it does take a longtime for the waiters to come to you to change your coal, but hey you have to understand because this place can get very packed.\n\nSometimes unfortunately, there are sometimes rowdy kids who go here, but don't let them ruin your experience, the service is great the waiters are very friendly,\n\nBottom Line;\nThis is a great place to go with friends and relax and enjoy very nice shisha \n\nAlso, there are pre-fix menus as well for an example for 20 dollars you can get a hookah two sandwiches and fries and two drinks,\nwhich is very great for a cheapdate!", "author": "Jennifer F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-09-10", "description": "I went there this afternoon. Nobody greeted us. We sat and after a few minutes someone finally came and took our order. The food was mediocre. The feta was good, but that was about it. The pita was hard. The baba ghanoush had no flavor. There didn't seem to be any employees that were really working. I think they were smoking the hookah.\nI always carry metal straws to drink from. When we paid the bill, we left without taking them out of our glasses. I made it all the way to the Staten Island Ferry before realizing i had forgotten them. I called the restaurant to let them know but lost my signal on the boat. I tried to call a few times but got a busy signal or no answer at all. When i got back to where i was staying, I called again. Only to be told, that the dishwasher had thrown them away and the trash was already outside. I call bullshit. I knew it was a long shot, but what can i do. I will just have to buy more.\nDefinitely won't be going back there.

Looks completely dirty. Holes in the couches. Dirty floors. They obviously don't care about this place. Don't even want to know what the kitchen looks like.\n\nNo one sat us. We sat ourselves. No one asked what we wanted to order. Had to get up and ask ourselves. And to top it off, they forgot to put the order in while they were just standing around.\n\nThen when we got our order a half hour later, the hookah hose didn't work. We walked out.

It was beautifully decorated with friendly courteous and prompt waiters. The place was clean and bright. We stopped going there since it became more grungy: poorly lit, dirty seats, dark, even sinister. Half the lights were not working and the backwards hats on the fellow behind the counter did not inspire me. The clientele is young, everyone pretending to be real cool fogging the air with non tobacco smoke which totally distracts you from enjoying any kind of food. Service is slow to non-existent. And the d\u00e9cor of booths with cushions is a poorly conceived idea. Many people put their feet on the cushions, which are dirty. The table tops have the veneer coming off and, in sum, nothing worked. It's become a den of non-dining, laptop toting, smoke-inhaling off-putting youth.

Things I love: the hookah, the comfy atmosphere, the cheesecake and the fries.

All the smaller tables had been taken and so we sat with another smaller group. For $15 we got a hookah with both coconut and mint packed into a half carved out orange peel. That was an interesting touch.\n\nThey mandated that every person order something, they just started serving boba (bubble) tea, and being a boba (bubble) enthusiast, I decided to try their green bubble milk tea. Now I should have realized that a place that didn't have any background in selling milk tea should not have advertised as such. Anyway, my order was just par, nothing special.
