Whenever my gf and I visit NY Gimaldi's in Coney it's always a must. Service is great and fast. We have gone at a time when they have been cleaning.

We walked over the Brooklyn Bridge on a mild winter day.. and there was no wait-- score! Having now eaten there, and knowing what it is, I would not wait more than twenty minutes in line. It was good, but not memorable. I've had 'memorable' pizza.

I've been to the Grimaldi's in Corpus Christi, TX so was pretty excited to try out the original one.  The wait really wasn't bad.  About 30 people or so standing outside in the line but it ended up only being about a 20-25 minute wait for a table of 5.  What really bothered me was the service, or rather lack of service.  Also, there is no salad to order with your pizza or even beer or wine.  Just pizza, calzones and plastic bottles of sodas.  We ordered one pizza and one calzone.  The pizza came and was burned on about 1/3 of it.  Not crispy and delicious but charred completely black and inedible.  We had to wait over 45 minutes AFTER the pizza came for the calzone.  I had one small glass of water to tide me over the entire meal.  I'm pretty sure the waiter ignored my signal to come refill it several times.  But, the pizza and calzone were absolutely delicious.  While the actual food was fabulous I think I'll stick to my hometown's Grimaldi's as it tastes the same and the service is better.  There are way too many good pizza places in New York I'd rather visit than go here again.", "author": "Holly M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-24", "description": "I don't know what happened on my last visit but I was disappointed. I think the cook was off or something but the pizza wasn't the same. Hopefully next time I am in town its as amazing as I remember. Go before they close or right before they open to avoid the lines.", "author": "Ruth K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-05", "description": "We waited in line for an hour and ten minutes.  The pizza was delicious and worth the wait.  I do have to say though that 3 slices of crust were burnt so black that it was worse than eating charcoal.  The line that you wait in outside is the same as dining in or takeout.  They do not sell by the slice.", "author": "Shannon L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-04", "description": "Everyone said we should try this place out - so we did. Fortunately, I read a number of reviews on YELP and, in addition to learning that a LOT of people like this place, I learned that it would be important to get their early because long lines were pretty common. It's not a large place, but well known and people are apparently willing to wait a while. We got there about an hour before they opened for lunch. I took a seat outside and after a few minutes, the owner came out to set up some ropes so that people would know where the lines should form. He looked at me, went inside, and came out with a chair for me to sit on!! So I took my chair over to the line - we were second in line. Once we got in - our order was taken right away, drinks arrived quickly. I had water and a house red - which was fine. We ordered two large pizzas - one with pepperoni, sun-dried tomatoes, and extra basil. The other with italian sausage, red peppers, and extra cheese. The coal fire oven was genuine - not the fake thing you see in some places. The pizzas arrived in reasonable time - piping hot - and were DELICIOUS. And I'm not really a pizza guy - but I could eat this on a regular basis. Definitely worth the wait.

Perhaps we went at a bad time.  But we waited an hour and after ordering a large pie for the two of us, it was soggy and cheese was not fresh (shame on them).  I would have to say Lombardi's tastes better and the ultimate is definitely still Totonno's, hands down, no doubt about it!

Grimaldi's is just as much about the food as it is about the experience.  I've eaten at this place many, many times so I'll just summarize why I will eat here many more times in the future.  Bring your walking shoes!\n\nIt starts with the 4,5 line to the Brooklyn Bridge / City Hall stop.  Preferably an hour or two before sunset.  The walk across the Brooklyn Bridge presents one of my favorite views of Midtown.  If you take this walk right before or at sunset, the buildings all look like they are made of Copper, Gold and Silver... breathtaking.  A casual walk as cars race underneath your feet is a great way to walk out of Manhattan on foot.  You get views of Midtown, Downtown, Statue of Liberty (distant but visible), South Street Seaport, Manhattan Bridge, Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, Brooklyn... all from the Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nHang left as you get to the Brooklyn side of the bridge and head down the stairs and to the right.  Never remember the park name, but it's always serene.  A short walk back in the direction of Manhattan brings you right up to Grimaldi's.  You can't miss it... just look for the line of people.  I've had many great conversations with complete strangers in that line so I never mind the wait.  You'll be sitting right up close to more strangers inside, so you better get used to being social.  It always feels like I'm at a huge family gathering or something in Grimaldi's for some reason.\n\nOh ya, the food...  Brick oven pizza through and through.  Cash only by the way!  The mozzarella is always fresh... the thin crust is always perfectly toasted... the basil, sun-dried tomatoes, pepporoni, sausage... always predictably tasty.  If you like thin crust, brick oven pizza then you'll like Grimaldi's.  If you stuff yourself too much, no worries.  Head out and to the right toward the pier.  I hit up the ice cream place about every other time, but always take a moment at the docks to look back at Manhattan.  If the sun is almost down, the downtown Manhattan skyline screams blue.  It's very peaceful and fun to watch the boat activity on the water for a bit.\n\nIf you timed it right and it's starting to get dark, the walk back over the bridge at night towards manhattan offers a completely different view of midtown and downtown.  All the lighted windows in the buildings make me think of man made stars.  It's a nice walk that delivers you back to the  Brooklyn Bridge / City Hall station just at the right moment.  So now you've gotten some exercise, experienced some great views, hopefully had some good company, and are ready to enjoy the rest of your evening doing whatever wherever.\n\nCiao!", "author": "Colby B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-15", "description": "Fantastic pizza.
