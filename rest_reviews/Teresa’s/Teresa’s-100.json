You would think that older people are much nicer. She was rude and nasty to me and gave me really evil looks and called me a 'b' out loud!! It was so obvious that was talking about me in her language to the other waiter because of the looks I was getting!! I felt very uncomfortable. This is All because I ask her to check on my order after seeing everyone else that came in after me were being served. The only great thing about this restaurant is the tall kid that showed me to my table . He was very nice. The food was good too although it took a while. I had no appetite at that time because of this woman's negative vibe! I am usually a big tipper but it's sad to say that she didn't deserve any. Shame .", "author": "Rose G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-24", "description": "It's good but, not the best. I love Polish food and at Teresa's you will find good food. The pierogis are great. I like them fried rather then boiled. The Kielbasa is great. The reason for the four starts rather then the 5 is the sauce they use on the stuffed cabbage. To me, it's only ok. My favorite Polish place is called \"Krakowiak\" in South River, NJ. That by far is the best but, if you can't make the drive to Jersey then Teresa's is the best I've found. I will keep looking because I love Polish food. If you know of a good Polish place, send me a message and I'll check 'em out.", "author": "Stephen M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-29", "description": "At first glance at the menu, I was a bit put off by the focus on Polish fare.  Don't get me wrong, I'm quite open minded about food, but I just wasn't in the mood.  I immediately saw that they were offering a brunch special with choices for appetizer (I had chicken soup, but they also had fruit and I think salad as options), entree (I had Eggs Benedict, they had Eggs Florentine, spinach blintzes, French toast, etc on the menu), a Bloody Mary (also had choices of Mimosas, and a couple other alcoholic drinks) and tea (or coffee) all for about $15.  Not bad!!!  Although the eggs were swimming in Hollandaise (something I'm normally opposed to) the sauce was really delicious and well worth the extra calories I ingested in attempts to finish it off!  \n\nThe only downside was the service.  They forgot my friend's cantaloupe and my other friend's side of kasha.  Our waiter was not the friendliest and seemed like he had better things to do than serve us.  He also brought out my tea before my entree arrived and while I was enjoying my Bloody Mary, which meant the water was lukewarm by the time I drank the tea.  I didn't care enough to make a big deal.  Besides, he was barely around our table long enough for me to send it back.  In any case, the food was worth it, and sitting outside was really enjoyable on such a lovely day.", "author": "Victoria K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-14", "description": "Great Perogies!

Welcoming as soon as we came in.  Service was very good and the food came fast. Our waitress was very nice and didn't check in on us a lot which was good. She kept an eye on us from afar and was there when we needed her. Food tasted great and was nice and hot from the kitchen. I had the eggs Benedict and it was cooked perfectly.

Would highly recommend. Being second generation Polish in town it was like eating at my Babci's or Mom's house. The food was fantastic. The service was more then accommodating handling a group of 10 people of various ages. It was like coming home for all who grow in Brooklyn  We held a brunch for a 60th B'Day for a member of the family.

Because, yes, that means I'd never eat there again. But this place has no reason to have as terrible service as it does. If I'd had a smart phone [yes, I'm a bit of a luddite.] I would have seen that it doesn't rate four stars on Yelp and moved on. But, I was in the area, and I needed brunch and a bathroom. Montague doesn't have much by way of brunch. You really need to check out Henry Street. \n\nThe interior was so depressing that I opted to sit outside although it was raining. The food was decently cooked. All in all, this place gets a \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" except for the service. Lackluster food aside. My water wasn't refilled. I wanted to order coffee and juice after the food came. Where is my waitress? I want ketchup for my eggs. Yes I could have gotten up and gotten these things myself. But what I did was finish my meal, up to the end of something to wash it down. Then I walked inside to pay my check, because who knows when my waitress would have gotten aroundto me. Both times, going in and coming out of the 2/3's empty restaurant, I passed no less than three servers in the vestibule having a conversation. \n\nWith service like that, obviously they never want my business again.", "author": "George D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-10", "description": "Good, solid, dependable Polish food.
