The food is really basics, nothing imaginative or interesting. Not enough vegetarian option, the bartender ignore me the majority of the time.

The fresh pasta dishes and the preparation of the meats and fish complimented with a modest price range make this place a place to frequent.  The wine list is decent and beer selection modest.  I would definitely recommend this place to all.  If you don't have time to wait, I suggest you go early evening as the wait tends to get long as you get into the peak hours.", "author": "Sang H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-04-22", "description": "Date Visited: April 11th\nPeople: Megan\nMy tab: ~$47\n\nA lively, happy classic italian joint in my neighborhood that's no reservations, cash only. It's not the most sophisticated of places but perfect for the parents. I walk past this place a couple time a month, but rarely feel like braving the lines. Fortunately, I spotted 2 seats at the bar and ordered a hendrick gin martini (which unfortunately had a small piece of ice in it, a very snobby pet peeve of mine). I got over it when our table was available in 15 minutes. Whenever we come here we comment on how horrible the wine list at this place. but fortunately they have a $14 bottle of  nero d'alva. I'd drink grain alcohol at that price. I started wih the carpaccio and parmesean, really getting into the tuscan, folowed by a very simple seafood fettucini with a somewhat spicy ragu. Like the best italian food it wasn't the most sophisticated dish but it's made with love fresh (not frozen) shrimp, homemade pasta, and a generous amount of cockles. I'm really not hard to please. Dessert again was next door at blue pig.", "author": "Peter N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-10-20", "description": "I have to say I don't know why this restaurant is so popular.  The food is ordinary, the tables are piled one on top of another and everytime we go there, there is a smell of some kind of insecticide.  Very off putting. the sauce is not special and watery. To me it is a restaurant that tries to hard to be clever.
