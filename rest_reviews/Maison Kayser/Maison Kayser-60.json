Really nice folks.\n\nBut recently it has become difficult to get anyone's attention when you walk in, especially at the coffee station.

Not a sole inside the restaurant except me in the seated section. Ordered an americano and a chocolate croissant. Both were very good but not excellent. Service was very quick and pleasant. The rest of the breakfast menus had egg dishes and other more hearty items if you're looking for something more than a croissant like I opted for.", "author": "Alicia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-29", "description": "Dropped in for a quick afternoon pick-me-up. Lovely place with generous seating area. Prices are okay. The prepped foods has an average selection of sandwiches, salads, fruit cups etc. I didn't see anything that I wanted to try.  \n\nThe bakery is chock full of goodies, starting from baguettes to mini desserts. Problem is everything is labelled in French. I was wondering if mgmt knew they opened the store in New York instead of Paris. Parisians can insist that fellow Parisians speak French but please don't impose that insufferable attitude in Downtown Brooklyn. So yes, a chocolate croissant is pan du chocolat. Like seriously, I don't have time for this. \n\nCrowd control is a concept the store mgmt will learn fast. Customers of bakery and prepped foods are directed to two registers from one line. So, inevitably a person with a sandwich will be stuck behind a person trying to decide between a brownie or a croissant. Again, wondering if mgmt knows how fast New Yorkers move. \n\nAlso, didn't see a coffee station. :-/ Perhaps I missed it.\n\nNonetheless, lovely place. Give it a try.

Knowing the  flatiron location, I knew we couldn't go wrong... well we did. We both ordered salads. One was the summer salad and the other one grain salad. The grain salad's portioning was ridiculous compared to the summer salad even tho the price difference is $1. We did call our server to tell him. He agreed with us. He then told the manager in front of us who did't seem to think it was important, he left without saying a word. I have to add that the summer salad's portion was also very off ( to the other extreme, with a ton of cheese and some sort of weird cubes of chicken, the flatiron location brings your extra added chicken (+$3) in one piece and nicely grilled). We did get the full amount on our bill which was also disappointing. Overall bad experience even tho people were polite.

This location in particular is the newest.  The pastries are not only elegant and beautiful but also DELICIOUS!  The almond croissant (~$3-4) is my go-to fave, and yes insulin pen required post-consumption. Brioche bun (~$3) and petite fromage (~$3) are other solid carbs you should try if you come here\n\nThis location sucks only because there's no place to sit/stand if you're just doing take-out.  The tables are only for \"full-service\" (even though all seats were empty on a Sunday, still gotta pay for that full service).  Where am I supposed to eat my overpriced pastries now ?\n\nRegardless, it's refreshing to have a legitimate Parisian bakery in the middle of Brooklyn!", "author": "Chelsea M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-29", "description": "Ok this place is first of all beautifully designed with an open kitchen kind of vibe.

First off, I ordered the almond croissant which was soggy and not flaky whatsoever. The almond flavor from the almond paste did not come through at all, and all I could taste was the icing sugar on top. Even when I tried to dust the icing sugar off, the croissant was still insanely too sweet. We also tried the croque madame, and it was also fairly mediocre too. Overall, would not recommend going to this place, although it is a nice place to go and chat, the quality of the food is not good in my opinion", "author": "Tiffany A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-06", "description": "The pastry shop: 4.5 stars\nThe sit-down restaurant: 2 stars\n\nThe pastry shop is fantastic, with the best croissants and bread ever, and the coffee pretty good too, although nothing special.\n\nI had a pretty bad experience with their sit-down restaurant, though. When I went there was only 1 waitress for approximately 10 tables of people, so we had to wait a LONG time to get seated and to order. Not her fault, but really poor planning on the restaurant's part. Also, I ordered a side of avocado, which is not listed on the menu, and got a sad half (not even) of a tiny avocado and was charged $4 for that! Are you kidding?? I know NYC has crazy prices but that was beyond the pale. When I asked her about it she just took my card and sped off because she did not have time to speak to anyone. \n\nIn conclusion... go for the pastries and bread, skip the restaurant.", "author": "Sharon T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-19", "description": "My wife and wanted to enjoy brunch Sunday at Maison Kayser.  We waited for 10-15 minutes to be seated while watching the staff scurry around resetting up the several empty tables.  There appeared to be no one to seat their guests?  Maybe a wave of diners came before us, the servers were rushing around, we had the impression they were under staffed.\n\nOur order was taken, a raisin danish arrived, it was so dry I could not cut it with my knife!  I sent it back, out came another danish dry and maybe over baker, it was not worth eating.\n\nThe salad nicoise arrived, looked great, as I went to cut a tomato, I noticed two large bad spots like maybe mold? on the skin of the tomato slice.\n\nWe were waited on by several people and did not know our main wait person.  we waited for someone to come by and ask how our food was.
