He wanted to start and A was for African food!\n\nThis place is a cute, cozy spot in Clinton Hill. It's great for a romantic date night with its dark tables and mood lighting. They only have beer and wine so we didn't drink but the options they had seemed good.\n\nWe ordered the Kategna for an app and the Meat Combo for Two for dinner, along with Baklava for dessert. \n\nKategna- These were toasted triangles of injera brushed with berbere and kibe. They were nice and crunchy with the right amount of spice. \n\nMeat Combo- I really liked everything that was there- stewed lamb, beef, and we got the gomen as our veggie side. The injera was delicious and sopped up all the curries perfectly.\n\nBaklava- Nice size piece that was warm and crunchy, yet soft and sweet.\n\nLooking forward to my next visit!", "author": "Lincy J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-01-24", "description": "I give this place 4 stars because this is the 2nd Ethiopian restaurant that I have been to and I like this place much better. Ethiopian in Brooklyn is much better than DC Ethiopian in my opinion. The Ambience was nice, food good, the only problem was they didn't have ice for their ice water. Prices were typical for that area. Average $18-$22 per dish. Their injera was delicious the best I had so far. Nice slow cooked dishes.", "author": "Melissa H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-10", "description": "The ambiance is nice and cozy but service is not good. It took forever to not only place our order but to receive it as well. I had finished half a glass of wine by the time the order came out. The consistency of the veggie combo is very runny.

The price is significantly higher than other Ethiopian restaurants in town and the portions are smaller. The staff also turned away a group that wanted to wait for a table, even though we were just getting ready to leave and they totally could have been seated where we were. As spices go, the food was flavorful but not particularly spicy... Not more than \"mild\" salsa. Great place to go with vegan friends!", "author": "Jane R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-01", "description": "Ethiopian cuisine at its finest: slowly simmered stews, perfectly prepared njere and warm, friendly service makes this a can't miss spot. When my Ethiopian friend said this is her favorite restaurant, I knew we had to experience it. Her recommendation did not disappoint. The collard greens (gomen) and cabbage (tikil gomez) were not overcooked- a personal pet peeve - but weren't raw either. \n\nMy Ethiopian favorite - especially on my plant based diet- is Missir Wett (berbere stewed split lentils) was amazing as well. \n\nNjere kept coming upon request and the staff were very accommodating. \n\nTo get the most use of the space and bang for your buck- as well as get the most of the Ethiopian cultural experience- order the same thing for your whole party (not individual plates). They will allow you to add additional options if you need and it's the best way to go! It makes for a really fun dining experience as well!", "author": "Rasool B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-07", "description": "It was a terrible.\nThe food was overpriced.

Your standard Ethiopian dish selections (but no sambusas here). The portions are somewhat small for the price. A vegetarian combo for one, priced at 16 bucks gives you a spoonful of four dishes of your choice (lentils, split peas, collard greens etc) served on injera accompanied with One injera on the side. \n\nFor some reason they price their mushroom dish (engudai tibs) separately ($18) and that can only be ordered with two dishes. All other Ethiopian restaurants I've visited include it in their veggie combo.\n\nThe food is good and their ater kik alicha (yellow split pea stew) is probably one of my favourites out of all the various Ethiopian restaurants throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan, but I always leave somewhat hungry. \n\nAs far as ambiance, it's a small but nice space, dimly lit and good for a date or a few friends. They also serve my favourite St. George's lager which is always a plus.", "author": "Racquel B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-03", "description": "I was a bit skeptical after the 3.5 star reviews but really liked the place!

The quantity of the food that you get in the combo meal is just sooooo small. It absolutely does not make sense. My friend and I had to order more food and finished more than half of the two other entrees we got. The food is tasty but I would never come back. They're also very slow with bringing out the food.

The environment is small and cozy and appears to be well maintained. Upon arrival we were not greeted at the door but behind a counter towards the back. The gentleman telling us to sit wherever. \nMyself and two other friends sat to enjoy a shared Vegan Combination platter, which was ok until we found multiple pieces of hard plastic (Polystyrene) in our food. When brought to the waiter's attention, he asked us what it was as if he did not know then took the pieces in a napkin to the kitchen. When he returned he mentioned the kitchen stated a storage container previously broke so that is where the pieces came from. The waiter then preceded to walk away and did not accommodate us or apologize. The bill arrived with all the charges, including the food we did not finish because we were afraid it had more pieces contaminating it. \nWe asked the waiter what he could do for the inconvenience and he mentioned at first nothing and then proceeded not to apologize once again. We asked to speak to the manager but he then stated he was the manager. You can clearly see where this story is going.\nLong story short Brooklyn has too many restaurants.

I watched the waiter sit and talk for 5 minutes before even attempting to get the bottle. After a bit of misunderstanding with our order, we got our food.  Everything was great.

Then the waiter gave us a vegan platter instead. I was with a friend having a conversation so we didn't see before we started digging in only to realize it is vegan. We wanted them to change it but they refused to cuz we already touched the food. The waiter was like \"YOU CANT TELL ITS NOT MEAT BEFORE EATING IT???\" Like it's our fault that we ate the wrong food, when it's their job to give the right food.... I'm allergic to some kinds of beans and I don't eat vegetables, so I had to sit through and watch my partner stuffing vegan food down her throat cuz she doesn't like to waste food.

The vegetarian combo costs like $18, which is too much. However, it was one of the tastiest Ethiopian meals I've ever had. I had the lentils, chickpeas and collard greens. The flavor was amazing (and not spicy). However, the consistency is very runny, so it's actually hard to eat with the injera without dripping all over the place.

Sadly living in Silver Spring exposed me to the best Ethiopian community in the country, as well as their amazing food. I know tibs can be good and spicy. Twice now the tibs from Bati have been overcooked and lacking flavor. It's sad. I really wish this would be great as I enjoy that I get two vegetables with the protein.

I liked the honey wine but the meat on the mixed meat platter didn't taste fresh or tender. The injera was a. It too sour for my liking.\n\nThe service and ambience was okay, the lighting was quite poor. l'm not sure if that is intentional to create some sort of ambience, but is was a little hard to see what you are eating.\n\nI doubt I'll visit here again.", "author": "Subodh M."}], "servesCuisine": "Ethiopian", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Bati", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "747 Fulton St", "postalCode": "11217", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H_V2pdmsd0PQ6pTnN_K-Bg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187979696"}
