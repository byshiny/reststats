We started with the linguini and the crab cakes. The first was way too salty and the second was just ok. Entrees were not much better. The sliced pear was the best part of the chicken dish and the Duck while crisped well was only  saved by the sauce. They came with no sides so we needed to purchase them separately.\n\nFor dessert :The Apple cobbler lacked sweetness to balance the tartness of the apples and the crumble topping. \n\nThe highlights of the evening were the bread and the bread pudding. Service was good and attentive.  I think even if I had not gone in with expectations, I would have been underwhelmed. I tried it but I will not be returning.", "author": "Linda M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-24", "description": "Excellent restaurant!  Try the walnut crusted chicken with pear its exceptional. Helpful and knowledgeable staff!

Super friendly service, and the space is very welcoming. Food was nothing outstanding, but the overall experience was enjoyable. \n\nWe ordered the special - soft shell crabs - which were small, but had flavor. The side of green beans and rice wasn't necessary, as it tasted like canned beans and Rice-A-Roni.", "author": "Scott G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-31", "description": "Definitely one of my favorite places in Brooklyn.

It's the antithesis of the trendy newcomer with reclaimed wood walls and gleaming subway tile lined open kitchen.  Expect to walk in and see locals, populating the worn but cozy dining room, decorated with the random bric a brac and the odd blaring neon sign on the wall.  \n\nBF and I stopped in last night, specifically to  take advantage of their in-season  soft shell crab offerings.  When we saw that they offered a $35 prix-fixe menu WITH soft shell crab, we decided to take advantage of that too.  I'm ashamed to say, that last night was our very first visit there.  Totally ashamed, since I've been a Heights resident for about 5 years now. \n\nFirst of all, do not order from the prix-fixe, if you're just moderately hungry.  I mean, if you've had a late afternoon snack, or a heavy lunch, you just won't be able to do it justice.  You'll need to have a roaring appetite to fully take advantage.  \n\nThe food -  \nSoft shell crab linguine with spring onion app.  This was soooo delicious. It probably had at least a half stick of butter in it, but I was very satisfied.  The portion was very generous, about 75 percent of a normal dinner portion.  I think I might just go back for this and order as a dinner.\nCrab cake app - There are two nicely sized cakes with very thick but crunchy breading accompanied with tartar  sauce.    Very meaty, though I don't think it was premium crab meat.  I tend to like my crab cakes less bready, but they were still tasty.\nDuck - To say my breast was huge, would be an understatement.  Ha, the duck, not mine.  But seriously, I don't think I've ever encountered that portion at a restaurant before.  Prepared with a nice and crispy skin, and sauced generously with a ginger jus. A touch too sweet for my taste, but still good.  I managed to finish half, and ended up doggy bagging the other half.\nSalmon - Very nice size, served with a beet salad and a horseradish creme fraiche.  Tasty, though I think maybe a touch overdone for me.  \nSides of rice and snow peas, What, more food?  \nDesserts totally put us into heartburn territory, but the mud pie and lime pie were very good, albeit decadent. \n\nThe drinks - they offer a great selection of wine and beer.  All are reasonably priced. I was happy with my fume blanc.\n\nThere is an upcharge on some the items - Salmon and duck were $5 extra, and the linguine was $2 more.  But so worth it. \n\nI'm totally going back next week for some more soft shell crab linguine.

The Yelp reviews are spot on. This place was great! Service was quick and super friendly. Love the open kitchen. There is something different on their menu for everyone to try. The duck, lamb and walnut crusted chicken were among the favorites in our group. The pre fixe menu has a large variety of choices and is really reasonable in price.

I've been here several times and the restaurant is on my top 10 places to take a date. First off, you're in the heart of Brooklyn Heights - where you get the Brooklyn Promenade and a quaint little community.\n\nThe food here is not good but GREAT. As a fan of wild game, I think the food here is cooked perfectly. Do you want your Buffalo steak, duck, or lamb chop cooked medium rare? Well then come to Henry's End because they know how to cook it. Also, for all you non-Meatatarians, they have a pretty good list of fish dishes to check out as well such as Sole with Lobster :).\n\nNot only is the food good but they also have a great wine list that's worth checking out. My friends and I have found several new bottles that we buy on the regular now.", "author": "Sean C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-25", "description": "One of my favorite restaurants, period.  Luckily I live very close so I get to experience it on a regular basis.  Henry's End is the type of place that a New York Times critic would come to every week but would never write about because they want it to be a secret.  This restaurant doesn't need any extra notoriety though as they've been open for 33 years.

We had pretzel rolled shrimp and turtle soup as appetizers, and duck w sour cherry sauce and venison stew for entrees. \nWe also both had key lime pie for dessert. \nI came with high hopes; I hadn't been for many years and remembered it being a kind of mystical place. \nI also thought of it as possibly a destination restaurant. \nI'm sad to report that none of any of our dishes were remarkable in any way. The duck was a bit dry and I've had many duck dishes that were better, my venison stew was way too salty. The turtle soup tasted like chili, there was nothing particularly interesting about it. The shrimp were good but, again, we did not have a \"wow\" response to any of the dishes, including the dessert. \nThe service was generally good but the server initially was pretty brusque. It looked like she had left another table hanging for too long and wanted to hurry with us so she could get to them. Although after that first exchange she was fine. \n\nAnyway, despite the Luke warm review I feel like I need to go back on a non-Xmas-eve night to see if I just caught them on an off night. If you're thinking about going don't let this dissuade you. \n\nJust think twice about Christmas Eve.", "author": "Launch S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-11", "description": "Been here a few times over the years most recently a month ago and always love the food and the wine.
