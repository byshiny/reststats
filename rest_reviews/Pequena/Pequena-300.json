They're margaritas are great, guacamole tasty, and their chips are homemade (the way they should be.)  Small and charming, it's perfect for a quick bite or some lingering quality time.  Having grown up split between the east and west coasts, Pequena holds a special place in my heart.  In a city known for amazing cutting edge cuisine, it's amazing how little vaguely decent mexican there is available.  All the more reason to shout out for joy that Pequena is here!\n\n*If you're around during weekday lunch hours, check them out.  The prices are lower AND include a side of guacamole.", "author": "Kristopher N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-23", "description": "Meeeh, so-so service and the food left better food to be desired.  The chips tasted a bit stale and instead of getting spicy chipotle salsa, we ended up with the less-than-stellar pico de gallo; when this mistake was brought to the waitress' attention, we were advised we could mix in the chipotle paste ourselves.  wow-you couldn't just mix it and bring it back the way it was supposed to be?  I suppose i give them credit for not wasting food when correcting an order....i can only imagine them saying \"just pull out the chicken and we can bring you the steak to insert back in the burrito.\"  Waited about 25-30 minutes for tacos--did you have to kill the chicken first?  I don't mind the wait for GOOD food, but when I was brought two sad little tacos, I was underwhelmed.   I'm not sure if the staff are overwhelmed or I hit a bad night, but I've had better service at Chipotle- and frankly, better tasting food too.   Bottom line: edible, but needs some work. Buy a burrito from Trader Joe's and call yourself wise.", "author": "Tricia L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-02-10", "description": "Very boring, uninspired Mexican.

However, they are clearly resting on the fact that they are basically the only game in town when it comes to credible Mexican in Fort Greene.  I ordered pork tacos for delivery and the three tacos were placed unappetizingly right on top of the beans.  This makes the otherwise good tortillas mushy and messy to pick up and eat.  You might expect that they'd add some contrasting crispness or flavor to the meat filling but you'd be wrong - no lettuce, cabbage, onions, or any fresh vegetable other than a bit of guac.  Very very bland. On top of that they forgot to include any salsa of any kind. Basically they are getting pwned by Loading Dock in terms of taco artistry and flavor.  If they were to step it up they could do a lot more business in the neighborhood.", "author": "Gabriel L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-20", "description": "The refried black beans are an addiction.

I thought the guacamole was awesome and my meal (black bean and plantain quesadillas) was great too.

I didn't think they used any decent ingredients in the food either... a lot flavorlessness. Service was ok nothing special. I am sure there is better Mexican food in Brooklyn.
