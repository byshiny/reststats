There is a typo on the menu that says \"house wine\" is $3 more than \"imported wine\". We thought it was weird and asked about it before ordering. The waitress is new and said she didn't know why, so my friend ordered the cheaper imported wine ($9). For the next round my friend asked how much a Jameson on the rocks was. The new waitress specifically asked at the bar and came back to tell us it was $8. \n\nWhen the bill came we were charged $12 for the imported wine and $9 for the Jameson. A manager came and explained that there is a typo on the menu and that the wine is $12 as though she was not going to charge us what the menu reads. Only after we argued back and said we specifically asked did she say she would change it. They would not relent on the $9 Jameson, as she said on the rocks is another $1. Never mind that we specifically had asked how much Jameson on the rocks was.", "author": "Kate S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-18", "description": "This is the first bad review I've ever written and it's definitely justified. Visited this spot to catch the World Cup. Food looked decent, so I ordered chips/sals/guac. Prior to placing my order I specifically asked our server if the guacamole was made in-house (because, in case you don't know this, most places use guac from a plastic bag they buy at a place like Costco in which has green fillers that isn't even real food). She assured me that the guac was made in house/fresh, so I proceeded with the order. My order arrived with a basket of corn chips and two tiny plastic containers, one with a green paste and the other with something that resembled salsa. I open the green one and smelled - the scent resembled something like a combo of dirt and chemicals. Certainly NOT fresh. The salsa was straight up Tostitos, but I could at least live with that. There was no way in hell I was going to put that green slime into my body, so I thought, \"I'll double down on the salsa.\" I asked for more salsa and she brought me back exactly one additional tiny plastic container of the Tostitos salsa. When the bill arrived, I saw I saw charged .75 for salsa. FOR SALSA with my basket of corn chips. The regular order was ~$8. I essentially paid ~$9 for a basket of corn chips at this place. I want to also note that our server did not notify me that she would be charging me an additional .75 for salsa. I tried bringing this to her attention at the end of the meal and she was incredibly rude to me. \"I don't make the prices.\" NEVER a good move. So I mentioned that I totally get that and I would appreciate it if she can float the suggestion to management and with attitude she replied, \"yeah yeah it's been floated to them.\" That's a great response. You are essentially telling me this has been an ongoing issue. Lucky for you I realize your response was impulsive and thoughtless...like the pricing of that appetizer and the fake guac.", "author": "Nicole P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-09", "description": "Just happen to stumble on this bar while walking through Brooklyn.

Servers were friendly and drinks were reasonably priced.\n\nOn my first visit, I asked the bartender for some food recommendations, and got the loyal \"everything's good here\" response.  Knowing that couldn't possibly be true, I was back to square one and perused the menu again.  A friend and I ended up splitting an order of the buffalo calamari, which was a tad rubbery, but well-sauced, and accompanied by some bleu cheese for dunking.  Their buffalo sauce is VERY sweet here, to the point we almost mistook it for BBQ sauce.  If you're looking for some heat, you may want to ask them for a side of Frank's Red Hot or similar.", "author": "Ryan F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-27", "description": "I've been to O'Keefe's many, many times since living and working in the area.

All sides are served in clear plastic disposable, portion control, even. The pickle on the burger is now a few slices instead on a nice spear. Lost some of its \"home\" feel.

This is a young bar with wide aisles; not one of those dark, narrow pubs so common everywhere. It is quite a  large space for partying and well-lit. Kinda geared for the tech/contractor/govt vendor workers (boro hall's government offices so close by). But this also means the establishment is clean, well-appointed, and well-kept-up. \n\nYes indeed. A solid, reassuring, secure place for drinks and flirting. Snappy bar service with the usual assortment of cold/hot bar girls. 3:1 ratio buybacks are not guaranteed at all, so do not even expect any. \n\nThere's numerous tables for co-worker happy-hour gabfests. Sizeable bathrooms (although the floors are typically covered in towels every time I visit). \n\nMenu: agreeable variety. Serviceable. Plates of sizzling pub-food standards (wings, tenders, burgers, etc) go gliding past you all evening long, the trays held high and level on the slender white wrists of the staffers hustling tables (inbetween gabfests of their own). \n\nOh well. If you're in the area and need a reliable type of place, (rather than a filthy hole-in-the-wall) this would be your best bet. Blacks (Fulton St is nearby) and whites comprise the crowd. \n\nThe only thing I can say to the negative is that it just doesn't feel all that 'intimate' (due to the high ceilings) and that its just a tad lacking in character.  There's the usual assortment of pseudo-nostalgic old-time memorabilia on the walls, (the way companies like Applebee's do). Picked by a marketing team. But nevermind that. \n\nOverall: O'Keefe's is a very efficient operation. And they have a Touchtunes Playdium wall-mount jukebox; very accessible; with a good speaker system. The Playdium is not that arrogant, annoying, neon-rimmed, full-size 'Virtsuo' model which resembles a giant smart phone and is as ugly as sin. Playdium is just as good and not so distracting.
