Everything I've tried on the menu is solid. Only problem is my stomach is an endless pit and I can easily spend $40-$50 on just myself .

The fish is consistently the freshest I've had (in Brooklyn), the ratio of rice to fish is perfect, and they are quick. Love the traditional stand and eat at the counter or order to go. My favorites are the toro and the salmon with wood ear mushroom.  \n\nI'm glad I don't live close by or there would be a sizeable hole in my pocket because this place aint cheap.

As others have pointed out, these are really small (and zip code priced), but filled with fresh fish and toppings. What I really appreciated was that they were willing and able to customize to my food allergies and really listened to make sure they understood.

I ordered the spicy tuna and the uni. T.H. ordered the salmon skin and then eel avocado. We stood at the counter to eat and the chef made our rolls one by one. He kept very good track of how quickly we were eating and made sure that there was less than a 5 minute gap between our first roll and our second. The fish itself was fresh, thanks to a good turnover rate and the rolls were surprisingly filling. Nothing completely out of the ordinary but simple, good food. Two plus a drink made me pleasantly full without being overly stuffed. The only drawback was that it was a tad expensive. For the speed and quality, though, it was worth it.", "author": "Caroline L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-09", "description": "Delicious, fresh hand rolls.

The shrimp was a little ripe and with so much spicy mayo it was easy to forget what I was eating.

It's simple with perfect execution. I really like the fact that they hand each roll to you. I've come here once a week for about 6 months. Ive tried every roll and they're all very delicious but I usually crave a spicy tuna and a jumbo shrimp and sometimes if I get a third I mix it up.", "author": "Enzo O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-28", "description": "As a frequent customer, I have been optimistic in the past that the service from the revolving staffs, sushi chefs would get better and better with each visit. Unfortunately, in this case, I fear it will never get any less gruff or less petty- I.e today's heat wave made Dekalb market the best solution for lunch.\nI arrived at the Daigo lunch counter a just little before 3pm, with my young daughter and a friend with his young daughter( we are all hand roll enthusiasts) We all decided to order the lunch specials with two hand rolls each which included a bottle of water- while we submitted our orders promptly at 3pm - they refused to honor the order as a lunch specials....and spent the next 5 mins telling us that they wouldn't take the order as a lunch special because it just turned 3pm!\nWouldn't it be more simple and cost effective just to honor the pricing \u0026 give bottles of water to two little girls on a really hot day, rather than to merit a negative comment towards their business? (given that there are a plethora of food choices in the nearby food stalls at Dekalb market, one would think that good business sense - would be to remain competitive and friendly to attract customers) This is the last time I shall be going to the Daigo Hand Bar.", "author": "Tati N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-13", "description": "I can never resist getting a handroll any time I'm at Dekalb Market Hall. It's just soooo satisfyingly delicious. A single handroll will cost you as low as $5.90. Dunk that goodness in your wasabi / soy sauce combo and wash it down with some pickled ginger.

Initially, the hand rolls were super tasty and the nori was super crunchy! Since then I've been back a good 5-6 times and, more recently, there is a drastic change in the rice:nori:filling ratios. They have been training new staff into rolling their hand rolls and it's just not the same. They still taste great, however way too much rice and too beefy. My personal favorite is and always will be their Yuzu Hokkaido scallop.", "author": "Joey T."}], "servesCuisine": "Sushi Bars", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Daigo Handroll Bar", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "445 Albee Square W", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Ct9Wygj0S_K0-2o61PLu-g/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": ""}
