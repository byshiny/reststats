This was my second time eating here and will be my last. \n\nThe first time my husband and I tried this place we were impressed by the balanced, rich flavors and quality of the food. We had a craving for a salad tonight so ordered it again and were beyond disappointed.\n\nAfter we ordered it we noticed that the vertical grills were shut down and instead they were grilling chicken breasts on their regular grill but we weren't concerned (perhaps their vertical grill was broken?)\n\nWhen we got home we quickly realized that not only was there almost no chicken in our salads but the few pieces that we had were dried out to the point of being jerky. A few pieces were so tough that we couldn't even chew through them. I've attached a photo of the chicken that was in our salads (this is about 1/3 of what we were given) so you can see what it looks like. The salads are 13.75 each.\n\nIf they keep this up I assume they will be out of business soon as there are so many other great options at Dekalb Market.", "author": "Lizz H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-19", "description": "I lived in Germany for 1.5 years. This is not what you would get from a doner in Germany. Looks like it, doesn't taste like it.

Got the doner sandwich. The servers handling the food wear gloves, it's a clean space and the food is fresh. Hit the spot. Very delicious!", "author": "Sam T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-30", "description": "Doner Kebob offers delicious chicken doner prepared in a variety of ways. You can get it as a wrap, cone, salad, or traditional Kotti doner (openface sandwich style) and no matter how you get it you cannot go wrong! The chicken is spit roasted like the classic gyro and sliced to order. The chicken is moist and spiced to perfection - perfectly salty with a dry spice rub that imparts a lot of flavor.\n\nI got the chicken doner wrap and my friend got the cone (basically, a thinner wrapper and smaller portion size). I thought my serving size was perfect as I have a big appetite but if you have a smaller appetite go for the cone (price difference is $15 for wrap vs $10 for cone). The chicken doner comes with roasted veggies (carrots, onions, potatoes, eggplant) as well as raw onion, lettuce, tomato, feta cheese, and yogurt sauce (you can choose which additions you do/do not want). I thought the roasted veggies added a lot of texture and flavor to the dish so I was pretty happy. This food stand is located in Dekalb market, so you can also get dessert after (try Ample Hill or cake pops!) and do your weekly shopping at Trader Joe's. The only constructive criticism I have to give was I wish the cone came in a container as you have to hold the cone the entire time to eat it. Overall, a great place for lunch or dinner!", "author": "Sam E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "I have loved this place since I first tried it at Smorgasburg! The wrap is filled with chicken and vegetables that have a great flavor! The ingredients taste fresh. The chicken has a really good seasoning on it and is not dry. Their white sauce is a great addition to the whole wrap.I love that they warm up the tortilla before filling it with all the chicken and vegetables. My only complaint about Kotti Doner is that it is a bit pricey, which is a reason why I make my visits far and few between.", "author": "Leslie S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-02", "description": "I'm German and basically lived off D\u00f6ner during my high school years. Kotti's D\u00f6ners are the best copy of a real \"German\" D\u00f6ner I've found in the States so far. The meat is slightly different, chicken rather than lamb/beef, but it's nicely charged on the outside and juicy inside. The harissa sauce is a non-traditional twist, but tastes great.

The bread is perfect, the salad and sauces perfect, the chicken delicious.  I do wish they would offer a lamb version, and some of that crazy reddish-pink garlic sauce that all of the Berliner Kebab places seemed to offer, but barring that, I can simply say that if you'd like to have a solid Berliner style Kebab here in NY, this place nails it.\n\nNext time, we'll ask for extra sauce.

The sandwich comes on a toasted sesame seed bread, which I thought was slightly over toasted making it difficult to bite into without scratching up my mouth. The meat inside the sandwich, however, was very tasty and tender, I just wish there was more of it because it was so good. The two sauces, a chili sauce and garlic sauce, added great flavor without being overpowering. \n\nOverall, I would definitely eat here again, but maybe try a different type of sandwich offered on their menu.", "author": "Carlo K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-10", "description": "Ever been to flavor town? Wait that sounds cheesy and a little creepy (sorry Guy Feiri)... Forgive me for that poor opener. Let me start by saying DELICIOUS! I had their \"Kotti D\u00f6ner\" sandwich and their chicken in this dish was soft, moist and seasoned through and through. They've topped it with some fresh greens and through two different types of sauces on there and I don't even know their names.

As a turkish and a fun of Berliner d\u00f6ner, it was a terrible terrible experience, time and money consuming for me.

Towards the back of the hall it has a couple selection of Doner Kebab ways in a bowl, in a wrap, in a pocket by way of Berlin. I choose the original way in a pocket. There is an assorted of side condiments such as pickled cabbage, cucumbers and two type of sauces. I picked the harissa chili one. While I didn't find it 'spicy' it did add a slight heat which I liked. The bread was warm, the meat tender and flavorful.

I went to Berlin a couple of years ago and noted how unique and delicious the bread was for their doner kebabs. This place absolutely nails everything about the experience. Bread, chicken, sauce were all great. I don't remember feta being on the kebab but it was a nice touch. Certainly way more expensive than Berlin but it's in the trendy new food hall so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af all I can hope is that the they do well and more of these spots open up in Manhattan so I don't have to travel for 45 minutes to get a good Berlin style doner kebab \n\nPs - the art behind the register had the name of the traffic circle my friend and I stayed at in kreuzberg so that was a cool touch that brought back some good memories", "author": "Karl W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-03", "description": "I ordered lunch around 1pm and never received the delivery.

I grew up in Germany and am very happy to see that this place exists. I had the D\u00f6ner Wrap and it did not disappoint. It looked well prepared and tasted quite fresh. I will surely return to try the more traditional Turkish bread version (which is the style I always had growing up). \n\n(Although a lamb option would be quite welcome, I have no complaints about the chicken. It was delicious. You won't regret it.)\n\nIs it as cheap as we might be accustomed to at our favorite D\u00f6ner spot back in Germany? No, probably not (though I can't speak for Berlin as I am not from there). But, when keeping in mind that the ingredients seem (to me at least) a cut above the average D\u00f6ner location, as well as the fact that renting real estate in this kind of location can't be all that cheap, well, then I can't say it's unreasonable. \n\nBesides, where else are you going to go? The Turkish-German style of D\u00f6ner is unique and in my opinion, well captured by Kotti Berliner. You're not going to find anything like this at your regular Halal cart. \n\nAlso, it was nice to have a quick chat with the owner in German who was hard at work personally manning the register and directing the whole operation. The whole experience for me was a nice reminder of home.
