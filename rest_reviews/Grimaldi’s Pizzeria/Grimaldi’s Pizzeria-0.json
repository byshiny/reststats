It may not be the best one but it has served as a Pizza College for some great pizza cooks that went on to open their own places. Tottono's in Coney Island, John's on the West Village, Patsy's in Harlem and Grimaldi's in DUMBO.\nThe thing about this place is that they sold the restaurant a couple of years ago and the new owners are what we now as Grimaldi's. The Grimaldi family opened Julianas, almost next door.\nBoth of them are really great but Grimaldi's have something over the rest of them: they get tomatoes delivered on a daily basis from Napoli. Pretty cool but not that important according to my opinion.", "author": "Jos\u00e9 Ignacio O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-15", "description": "Worst Service Ever!!! PIGS!!!! I was so excited to try this place since I heard so much about it. I came here with my boyfriend and my mom and we waited outside on the line for 20 minutes. After we finally got in, they sent us upstairs and told us to sit on a bench. Meanwhile people that were behind us in line got to go in an sit before us. Then we complained they told us to go downstairs, we did, one guy told us to sit at a table, the other guy said no we can't sit and that he was saving the seat for a family of 13 so we ended up leaving because clearly they do not know what they are doing. We will never go back to this disorganized mess of a place.\n\nThx for responding business owner but how does this benefit me and my family? You guys don't care because you always a line.", "author": "Michelle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-13", "description": "I was driving by Grimaldi's pizzeria and to my great surprise there was no line and I decided to order take out .. I ordered large pie with pepperoni and mushrooms .. I paid and tipped the waitress who took my order. I politely asked where should I wait .Manager approached me and pointed at the rock outside of pizzeria, somewhere in the middle of the block  . I thought he was joking and I was like -oh ok .. I sit at the counter and order a drink . He said - No . It's a restaurant's  policy that I can't wait for the take out even if I'm going to order a drink and that he's being nice to me by pointing at the rock so I dont have to stand on my feet . But restaurant is empty .. -It will get busy .. - not in the next 5 minutes until the pizza is ready .. Then he told me ok .. wait outside of the doors .. I was standing humiliated next to the door  in front of empty restaurant while waiting for my 25$ pizza .. But my humiliation wasn't over yet , Manager sends over a hostess , she tells me that her  manager doesn't want me to stand next to the door and I have to leave a restaurant until my pizza is ready  , I wasn't believing my ears , I was helpless .. Tears were chocking me , I asked if they don't want me to wait for pizza then I can take my money back and leave while talking to the girl  my pizza got ready and I grabbed it and ran far away to never come back to this place ever again .. I paid 25 $ plus tip for my humiliation at Grimaldi's pizzeria doors while staff was hanging out at the empty counter .. Thanks for the experience which I never forget ......\n\nP.S Joseph S . thanks for your reply .. But I don't believe that you're going to do anything about this . There are so many reviews regarding this person's rudeness , How can you let your customers being  verbally abused and humiliated ,He has  been working at this place for years and nothing is done !", "author": "Nina O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-04-26", "description": "full disclosure, I've been very iffy about this place from day 1\nit is obviously not a bad pie.\nIt is very decent NY pizza, but it does not live up to the hype\nand I feel bad to the tourists who line up for this place..\n\nbut if you are in dumbo and looking to eat something,\nit is definitely not a bad choice, but Juliana's might be slightly better (though not MUCH better).\n\nTheir ingredients are good and since there's a always a big crowd, I believe they are fresh as well, since the purchase cycle of the ingredients would be way more frequent than other places!

Be prepared to wait 20+ minutes! If you're a party of one or two, make friends with another party of one or two and they seemed to sit those parties much quicker! Also if you're a party of 5 or more they'll will straight up tell you that your best bet is a \"to go\" order if they already have a large group inside, there are parks and benches just down the street and Grimaldi's staff will provide plates and such.\nOk now for the food!!! Pizza is DELICIOUS, and piping hot. We ordered a Large, pepperoni, sausage and ricotta cheese. It didn't need any extra Parmesan cheese on top or chili flakes, nothing! If you want to compare it to famous Joe's Pizza, this crust is thicker and the sauce is thicker also.

At that time, I thought the pizza was out of this world. However, after my most recent visit, I was less impressed. The chicken was extremely bland and didn't taste good at all. Also, sitting on the highest floor of the restaurant, the temperature was EXTREMELY hot. We felt like it was overwhelmingly warm and it deterred from our overall experience at the restaurant. I see myself trying out a different pizza place in Brooklyn next time I'm in the area - this visit wasn't the best.", "author": "Vidisha P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-28", "description": "I was asked as we left the restaurant - was the wait worth it? Answer: yes.\nThe line was daunting but it moved pretty quickly considering - we only ended up waiting for about 30 minutes and then were seated in their upstairs portion of the establishment. You can only order whole pies so we settled on a large regular (the other option is a white pie which doesnt have crushed tomatoes, just more cheese) with pepperoni, sausage, onion and garlic. I love how there wasn't actual sauce but just crushed tomatoes and our toppings. The crust was thin and crusty, and was the perfect base. The three of us somehow managed to finish the entire thing and didn't regret it one bit.", "author": "Tram V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-18", "description": "Great experience!!!

Figured after a loooooong Brooklyn bridge walk I would reward myself with a nice pizza from Grimaldi: \"the better spot\". Welp, I couldn't have been more wrong!\n\nOver one hour of wait and getting bird pooped on later, we finally come in to the \"legendary\" Grimaldi's. Little pizza place, family owned, family friendly. Nothing over the top or super cool about it. Very average \"Italian pizza shop\" style. \n\nOnce we FINALLY go in after freezing our butts off, we have more waiting to do. Yes. Took forever to be acknowledged by our waiters. Finally we get our little one page paper menu with our paper plates and cutlery. Here we are after hours of wait sitting down to paper plate settings. It's ok though because a good pizza doesn't need to be served on a porcelain platter. I mean if it's good it's GOOD, right?\n\nAfter our plain old margherita pizza came out, it was nothing but pure disappointment. Nothing outstanding or original about it. The dough sucked. The sauce was basic. \n\nI would never complain about a pizza place because you can never go wrong with pizza. My issue here is the hype is way too hype. You're going to be disappointed as I was. But sure, don't knock it til you try it. I'll let you knock it yourself but it's pointless to wait. Truthfully worst hyped up pizza of my life. We're in NYC, the capital of pizza.

They said it's not the \"best\" but it's a damn good pie.. and they were right.\n\nWe got a grilled chicken salad and a meatball and pepperoni pizza. To be honest thumbs down on the salad (who cares it's a pizza joint anyways) the cold chicken on the salad isn't what we were expecting but maybe we should have been more specific and asked for it still hot! Now now you're here for the pizza review!\n\nThe use fresh cut mozzarella cheese which really gives it just a fantastic flavor. I loved that. They also put a very generous amount of topping on the pies too. They do however use a spice in their meatballs that I hate. Don't know what it's called but it's that one that makes sausage taste a certain way. The haters of that spice will know what I'm talking about. But the pizza was great and I'd go back for sure. I would 100% be trying something different however.", "author": "Anthony H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-16", "description": "This was my first visit to Grimaldi's. It was a Wednesday at noon after a walk across a very crowded Brooklyn Bridge. It looked fairly busy then most of the people left since they were all part of a Brooklyn tour group. The manager seemed friendly and upbeat. I ordered the small traditional pizza. I enjoyed my meal while watching local CBS and ABC news and listening to Frank Sinatra, followed by Frank Sinatra and then a little Frank Sinatra. I somehow was able to finish it all. I would consider the taste to be in the more satisfying range for thin crusted pizza.

Line up was long but well worth the wait. If you go, be sure you're prepped for the wait. We went for the experience. Going to Brooklyn you must have a pizza from Brooklyn. Staff was friendly and fast after we got our table. Really enjoyed the pizza. NY pepperoni is delish. I love marinara with basil so I do wish they would have put on more basil but it may not be for everyone. There was left over but which we took home for later but we were so full after and on the go the next day and we weren't able to take it on the plane. Wish we had a Grimaldi's in Toronto Canada?!
