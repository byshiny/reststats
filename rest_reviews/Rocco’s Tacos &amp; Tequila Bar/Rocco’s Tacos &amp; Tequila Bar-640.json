Under staffed. Waited forever for water, then drinks and wound up having to cancel the food order due to them not being able to do substitutionsand taking too long. Didn't get to taste any food. Also the pitcher of drinks is a rip off because it literally only filled three glasses. Pitcher was 35 Ind margarita is 10 so for 30 you can eat 3 full ones.", "author": "Cassandra C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "This wonderful gem is conveniently located right by my job. I love coming here for drinks and nachos! The guacamole is delicious and so is the sangria!! Come here hungry! The portions are ginormous and you feel bad not finishing them because the food is yummy! Really cool bathrooms with television screens in the stoles.

The Decor I will give 5***** \nThe hostess and our waitress will get 5***** as well they we're very nice and attentive!!\nFor apps we ordered chicken flautas which was pretty good I'll give 3*** we also ordered chips and salsa that'll get  4****. We ordered a pitcher of strawberry frozen margarita and I will give that 3*** we had to ask the waitress for flavoring because it taste bland watered down  I live for margaritas it's my favorite beverage lol so it was kind of disappointing but the waitress gave us some flavor to add to it. Maybe next time I'll order it on the rocks! \nFor our entree I ordered the Durango which is a combo of a BBQ pulled pork toastada the pulled pork was way too sweet I think my glucose went up lol, cheese quesadilla; supper good , steak soft taco that came with two small 1 1/2 inch strip of steak; the steak was great I wanted more! My girlfriend ordered pork flour tacos which was overly sweet as well we don't know what was going on that night but it was just ridiculous how sweet it was!! We ended our meal with a dessert tres leche cake it was delicious!! So all in all I think I'll have to come back to give them another try", "author": "Iesha M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-06", "description": "The place to come too..great atmosphere. ..Brooklyn is where it's at...Rocco's is the place to come to and enjoy the food, drinks and fabulous atmosphere. .", "author": "Mo C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-18", "description": "First night in the city and really wanted something good to eat.

Full of onions, scallions and other greens. Wasn't greasy at all. It was filling but not heavy. Frozen strawberry margarita was watery \u0026 needed to be stirred often, tasted watered down. Didn't taste like it had much alcohol. Tacos are a bit pricey for their size but it was worth it. Also, the new manager is nice \u0026 cares about your experience expect for the woman the door. She was quite rude \u0026 snappy when it came to missing our reservation even though the restaurant was empty so that made no sense on her part.", "author": "Lira K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-27", "description": "First time at Rocco's and I must say I've been blown away from the moment I walked in. Jarren, our server, was extremely courteous and friendly and made sure my girlfriend and I were accommodated throughout our stay. The Brooklyn tacos are a must try!

I know not the typical request in a bar, Tuesday is a bit packed they have a 'Taco Tuesday' special, drinks and tacos included.

Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.", "author": "Jim M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-07", "description": "The last time I had table service, the guacamole was super pasty like a butter spread (I like it chunky) and pretty flavorless - which is surprising considering it's made fresh right in front of you. \n\nI decided to give them another shot. This time around, I specifically asked the waiter to tell the guy who makes it that I want the guac chunky. When the guac guy showed up (same one as last time - just my luck), I again requested to make it chunky. He bowed his head \"ok,\" but still made it pasty just like last time. Really? What can you rely on in a Mexican place if not on their guac??? :(( The fish in the fish taco (despite my request for it to be \"cooked medium so as not to be dry\") was (again) overcooked and dry. Bummer :( They also put the wrong cheese on one of the salads. Their shrimp tacos are not bad. The spinach/cheese quesadilla was nothing special - I could probably make a better one at home.\n\nFollow up: 2-3 hours after eating, my stomach is turning and I'm running to the bathroom :( For this, you lose a star.", "author": "allison a."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-28", "description": "We went for brunch on a Sunday to take advantage of their 2 hour bottomless mimosa or bloody mary special. When we ordered, the waitress informed us that not only were they out of champagne, but out of tomato juice as well, so that neither drink was available. We said, \"That's fine, just make screwdrivers,\" as we knew they had orange juice and vodka. She said that was fine, but neglected to tell us that she wasn't going to put those through as part of the bottomless deal. I asked to speak to the manager and he gave some canned excuse that his \"system\" wouldn't let him make any allowances. I said, \"So put the screwdriver orders through as mimosas in your computer\" and he said, \"That would be stealing from the company,\" which is of course an idiotic response. In any event, running out of such basic ingredients is simply not acceptable for a NYC brunch spot.\n\nWe were going to walk out at this point, but it was past 2 o' clock and we were hungry. I made repeated attempts to contact the general manger or owner through email and phone, and all were ignored. Nobody ever called me back, despite assurances that someone would. Rocco is clearly either dishonest or lazy. The food was very good, but the service and the blatantly false advertising far outweighs that.

I came on a Tuesday around rush hour and I was amazed by the ambience and decor. I ordered a Hongos, bistec and shrimp tacos. Hongos and bistec were nicely packed and the shrimp had 2 or 3 shrimp in it. For $6 the shrimp taco should have at least 4, 5 shrimp. However, the flavor was there. Overall, great experience.
