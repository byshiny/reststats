Everything was flavorful and fresh. Recommend the summer rolls (very thin and moist skin), Pho, and Vermicelli Noodle Bowl with BBQ pork.

For over a year, I have been ordering take-out from the Hanco's in Brooklyn Heights. There has always been something wrong with the delivery from the Hanco's in Brooklyn Heights- either the rice would be too mushy, the baguette on the bahn mi would be too soggy, or the food was just cold (most likely because it was delivery). But, this location in Cobble Hill strangely doesn't deliver to my neck of woods in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\nMy friend and I happened to be walking around the ritzy side of Cobble Hill and decided to sit down and have lunch here. Both my friend and I ordered a grilled pork bahn mi and a Vietnamese iced coffee. I also ordered a pork chop rice entree to share. The first bite of the grilled pork bahn mi sandwich was heavenly. The baguette was crisp and had just the right amount of carrots, radish, hot sauce and then some- Sriracha sauce available if you need some more hot sauce. The grilled pork chop rice entree was also delicious. The rice dish comes with obviously rice, mesclun salad, carrots, radish, and pork chop with a side of fish sauce, and of course hot sauce.\n\nThe price of their food is definitely on the higher end, since you can probably get a similar bahn mi sandwich in Chinatown for about $5. But nevertheless, the food is still delicious. I am hoping that in the near future they will deliver to my area.", "author": "James W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-31", "description": "I found Hanco's during a random search for pho in Brooklyn. For some background, I am from DC and eat pho at least once a week (I'm obsessed). I was not disappointed with this selection. I got the beef pho and Vietnamese iced coffee to go. The pho portion is great and filling. The broth is very good (so tasty)! \n\nThe staff is nice and smiled.

Isn't the best I've had, but definitely hits the spot. They got the basics right. Great value, and decent flavors.\n\nThe Beef Pho broth could do with more depth, but gets you there in terms of taste if you've had authentic Vietnamese pho before. The Bahn Mi uses ground pork, but traditionally uses different slices of cured meat. Still tastes good and will do for now! \n\nPS: I'm from Melbourne, Australia so I've been spoilt by the high Vietnamese population keeping it really traditional.", "author": "Ronald L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-16", "description": "Out of all the Vietnamese restaurants I have been to, this is by far my favorite!! Between the sandwiches (white shredded chicken I prefer), pho soup, and rice vermicelli (one of my favorite dishes), they all taste fresh! I love trying new foods and the woman at the register was very helpful in helping me to decide what to try next. I have only had 2-3 drinks from here but they were great as well.

I've tried MANY viet places in the area and thus far I'd have to say Hanco's is the most authentic place I've eaten at.

I found this place based on Yelp suggestions. Can't go wrong here. It serves a good Pho and well filling. The place is Cute, a bit small, but very friendly service. \nI had a Pho ga and summer rolls, which are fresh rolls, not fried. I took my order to go and in all honesty it would have helped if I had an extra empty container to mix up all the ingredients. By the time I was done mixing it up there was very little liquid left, as there were so many ingredients to add   Needless to say I had to eat it in stages to avoid a big mess on the table hehe. \nGets flavor, not greasy. Tons of veggies and herbs to add to the broth.

I say soup base because that's the highlight of a Pho noodle soup. I hate going into a place and ordering a PHo and the soup base is super bland. Not at Hanco's though their soup base is pretty tasty and the best so far for the price we are paying. \n\nI love the bread they use for their sandwiches not too hard that it cuts the roof of your mouth like other places. perfectly toasted so its warm but not hard. If you cant decide what kind of sandwich to order go for the classic with med spicy or the tofu sandwich with med. spicy.
