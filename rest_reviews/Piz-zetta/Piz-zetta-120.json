Good Cheese, decent meats. with a sweet sauce, that is a little on the crushed tomato side. They could cook it a little more as the bottom will fall on the fold towards the front of the slice. Dough is good, a little lighter than I would prefer but overall I will order from them anytime I am here given the consistency and good solid taste.", "author": "Al C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-09", "description": "Great place. Pizza was delicious but not overwhelming. Owner is a straight original Italian. Great conversation. Coming back", "author": "Seyed G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-17", "description": "I felt like I struck gold when I came in here. \n\nMy husband and I have been griping about what Brooklyn Pizza places have become for quite some time now (I know I'm obnoxious because I'm only 22 - but you know what?  Pizza was 10x better when I was 5) . Any who when we dined here we were impressed and cheered up. \n\nFirst off, they're off of Court street which is a major street with foot traffic and LOTS of hungry people. I had passed by this place and doubted it survive because its on Livingston and kind of hidden from Court Street.  However, after dining here and tasting their pizza and seeing their prices, I believe they will do very well. \n\nComing in, the place has a great feel to it.  It's bright, clean, spacious and modern.   It doesn't have the typical look of most pizzeria's but it's also not so far from it that you're not sure what kind of food they make.  \n\nThey have a friendly staff who are just so chill and relaxed that it feels like a neighborhood place and not nestled in loud bustling downtown Brooklyn. \n\nThe pizza is GOOOOOD!   I like the slightly rubbery cheese and the sauce; the crust wasn't burnt which was nice since that seems to be too much to ask for now a days.  They have unique mozzarella sticks in that they are made in a particular batter I can't put my finger on. The batter reminds me very much of the batter used on most things in Park Slope's chip shop. It might not be for every body but I feel like I'm eating healthier Mozzarella sticks, and believing that makes me feel better inside. \n\nTheir specials and deals are really good.  They have a text program where you can receive coupons. A big flat screen they keep at a moderate volume and a cute seasoning station. Their tables have nice back splash and the whole restaurant gets ton of natural light from outside. Also free wifi. :) \n\nFrom their logo to their pizza this place is great.  I hope more people discover and enjoy it.", "author": "Kassandra O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-23", "description": "I order from here regularly and it is always excellent. Be warned, the large pizzas are huge!

The space itself is very new and modern looking however its not a very large space and there is not much seating.  There maybe 6 small tables and a counter running along the wall.\n\nThe pizza is amazing though.  The pesto tomato slice is is a must try.  I've also had the pepperoni and plain and they are both great.  Though this place might not win any city wide competitions, it's a perfect spot for a quick slice, where you know they won't over cook it and use fresh sauce and cheese.", "author": "Drex H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "This free can of soda coupon is BULLSHIT. Also, the owner was super rude on the phone. When I called to make sure that the delivery guy would bring my soda, he was suddenly too busy to stay on the phone and said he would call me back - which he never did.\n\nMy first and last time ordering from this place. There was nothing wrong with the pizza itself, but I hate to give my money to people who treat their customers the way they do.", "author": "Laura O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-15", "description": "The place doesn't look like much from the outside - looks like just another pizza place. But one bite and you can tell - thin crust and slightly crispy on the bottom. Juicy mozzarella cheese on top, and tomato sauce bursting with flavour.

Lots of cheese, the flavors aren't too challenging, and lots of cheese. \n\nI'm not a kid, though. The crust is way too bready, there's not much flavor, and there's far too much cheese. Sorry, guys.

Called them, they acted like I was inconveniencing them with my inquiry, complaining they were so busy and it was in the way. 20 minutes later called back they said it's on the way- do what you want, first attempt at using them, utter disgrace.

Definitely ordering again.", "author": "Meg S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-25", "description": "It was love at first bite.\n\nEverything we have tried has been amazing. The crust, the sauce, the bread used for the sandwiches, and the chicken cutlet (according to my boyfriend, who considers himself an aficionado of sorts) are all superb.       He also digs the side order of meatballs as a hearty starter. Our favorite pizza to share is the margarita- thick, large slices of mozzarella nestled in incredible sauce and drizzles of high quality olive oil.  The bf also loves the buffalo chicken. They don't skimp, either- lots of food for an extremely reasonable price.\n\nThe staff is lovely and warm. And speaking of warm, go for one of their chocolate chip cookies. My brother moved to LA last month, and begs me to send him cookies from Piz-zetta! When I dined in with him, Anthony waited to warm up our cookie until we gave him a thumbs up to indicate we were through with our meal. Very thoughtful!\n\nThis place might be off the beaten path of Court Street, but only by a few hundred feet. SO worth it. \n\nSide note- If you use Delivery.com, their whole menu isn't on there.", "author": "L O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-27", "description": "Good pies for reasonable prices and the delivery is pretty fast. I've had single slices, too, and they are definitely passable, although I found the crust to be a bit too crispy for my taste.

It was very quick and simple.  I LOVE that it also provides you with an estimated delivery time.\n2) Delivery was very fast and the delivery person was very friendly and personable.\n3) The pizza was great though it wasn't the best I have ever had in NY.
