The first time I had Grimaldi's I thought the pizza was phenomenal. Fresh mozzarella cheese right out of the coal brick oven served right to your table with toppings of your choice that range from $2-$4 per topping. The first bite is the best, on to the second and third, then you are so caught up trying to eat as much as you can before it turns cold that you forget why Grimaldi's is so good in the first place. Personally,  after my second visit I came to realize that Grimaldi's pizza was good but only lasted up to the 3rd bite then it loses it's yumminess, because the pizza turns cold so quickly that the mozzarella becomes a bit chewy. I would still recommend those who haven't try it to see for themselves, but in truth there are other pizzerias in NYC that are just as good if not better. \n\nWhile you are there, don't miss the Brooklyn ice cream factory for some desert,  and the beautiful view of the city and the Brooklyn bridge.", "author": "Kristy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-04-15", "description": "Came here after the Yelp event last night and once again, it was a huge disappointment (although thankfully there was no line this time).

It isn't the best pizza the city has to offer, but it is by no means the worst, either. \n\nDuring a perfect dining experience here, you will only be slightly annoyed at their service. At worst, you will be seriously ticked. The lines are long and parties are often seated in a seemingly arbitrary order. The staff is rude and in serious need of an attitude check. The inside of the restaurant, should you make it this far, is dirty and cramped.\n\nAlthough the food is good, I'm not sure if that is enough to make a visit here a worthwhile endeavor.

The pizza were super good if you like the thin crust types. You can also customize different toppings from the menu.

Walked right in no line. Stood at the fromt of the restaurant and waited to be sat. Finally someone offered us a table. Sat at a nice corner table in the back of the restaurant. Then NO ONE came to the table to offer water, to say  \"Hey, I am your server, I will be right with you.\" NOTHING, it was like we were invisible. Waited about 10 minutes. So we left. The table next to us also got up and left about 5 minutes before we decided too. I am glad they are doing so well that they can afford to have 2 tables just walk out and leave. Will NEVER go back.

But due to high expectations and the level of volume and influx of new customers they have to serve on a daily basis is overwhelming enough.  Therefore, they lack in attention to detail and its quantity over quality.  Our pizza was very bland, and lacked a lot of flavor.  But I understand their business model and why it works because they get many tourists from all over the world for a one time dining experience.  With the incredible amount of wait time and rude service from the old man at the door, needless to say, I will not be returning at all.  And, I truly i understand their ego and the rudeness because regardless their business will flourish and the customers/tourists will always be there.  But I doubt true locals will though, just my opinion.", "author": "chris p."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-08", "description": "This was my second stop for pizza when I came to New York, and the pizza was mightily good.  We ordered two large, which was a little sad, seeing as there was only four of us, but we do eat a lot, but then again, the pizzas could have been a little bit bigger.  \n\nOne pizza has pepperoni and red peppers, definitely a good combination, and the other pizza had Italian sausage and mushrooms (if you have read any of my other posts about pizzerias, then you will notice this is not the first time I have had this combination).  The Italian sausage and mushrooms pizza was really good, definitely one of the better ones I have had, top 5 at least.\n\nWe went around 5ish on a weekday, where we pretty much walked right in with no wait in sight, which was lucky for us.  The service was kind of bad, the waiters were pretty rude, and seemed to be rushing you out the door as you were still finishing off that last slice.  Even the owner came and started to take away dishes when we were still eating off of them.  But this all made sense as we left and found the block long line waiting outside.  \n\nSo if you go, and you probably should since the pizza was great, just a little bit of rude service (normal to New York I suppose), go earlier in the day, during off food hours so you don't have to stand in a monster line that looked like it could take an hour or two, or just make sure you are starving when you get to the restaurant around dinner time.", "author": "Alex C."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Grimaldi\u2019s Pizzeria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "1 Front St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gWKNFR58TIuA7M25dqj9rQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584300"}
