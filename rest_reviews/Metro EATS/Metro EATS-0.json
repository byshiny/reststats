They have a salad bar ($8.95 for unlimited topping small salad, or $10.95 for the large), a juice bar (add protein powder for $1!), a sandwich station, and a hot sandwich grill (including quesadillas, tacos, and burritos).\n\nTons of options, but I went with the pastrami and Swiss on rye (with Russian dressing). I wanted corned beef, but they actually didn't have it. Oh well.\n\nYou could tell the people making the sandwiches didn't create the menu, but they sure tried their best. I'm sure after a few weeks, they'll be a well-oiled machine. The pastrami was fresh-sliced, and the Swiss was perfectly melted on the grill. Pretty damn good pastrami sandwich!\n\nThe hot bar didn't look too... hot since I went near closing. But I would like to try it during lunchtime one day because their options look great. Lots of Latino inspired options, like pernil, and your hot buffet mainstays like pasta and chicken.\n\nThey have a big drinks selection, and also a back dining room (plus window seating in the front).\n\nStaff is super friendly, and I'll be back soon!", "author": "Kenny C."}], "servesCuisine": "Delis", "priceRange": null, "name": "Metro EATS", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "292 Atlantic Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XqWNPXIEApsK9cgXYVyYMA/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+13477254106"}
