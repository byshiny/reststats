I was able to Immediately order a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese on a Toasted Everything Bagel. I did have to wait for 7-8 people to get their food first. During that time, there were some confused interaction between store and customers. My order was perfect. The bagel was overly toasted giving a strong burnt onion and garlic taste. Both sides had the everything season which was good mix but could have used more salt. The bagel itself was too dense and chewy. The eggs were freshly cooked but have no salt or butter. The bacon was pre cooked but lacked any crunch. The cheese was standard American but not very melted. Overall, it was cheap and filling but not on the same level as other New York Bagel places.", "author": "Leonard L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-07", "description": "My Fort Green bagel spot! \nYou're definitely moving up the list.  \nWide selection of breakfast and gourmet deli sandwiches which I have yet to try, this is based solely on their bagels. \nAmple amount of cream cheese selections: \n- 3 diff types of jalape\u00f1o cream cheese\n- 2 types of lox \nand your standard affair of strawberry, tofu, etc. \nWide selection of bagels behind the register: \n-everything\n-sesame\n-poppi\n-whole wheat\n-whole wheat everything\n-oh and the infamous rainbow bagel, they got that too. \nI personally got the sesame with bacon and herbs and it hit the spot.

One of the few places around this area that are still fairly priced.   Breakfast and lunch special are really good, they don't hold back on their sandwiches or bagels.

There's no secret why I chose this place. \"La Bagel Delight\" is, well, delightful! Walking here with my brother after the gym I was starving. I checked my bookmarks and saw that I had added this place. It wasn't a bad walk from my job, but it was definitely worth every step I took to get here. Once we arrived, we wondered into a place that was extremely busy. Nonstop traffic in and out of the deli. Every seat was full. What was going on? My stomach needed to find out. After a brief wait I got to the counter. The lady that took my order was wonderful and pleasant. She asked what I wanted, wrote it down and asked my brother. I was in such a good mood after dealing with the employee, I paid for my brother. The wait for our breakfast was a little long, but that's because of the amount of business they do. The wait wasn't so bad because they played great music. I listened to the sweet sounds of Perter Cetera and Foreigner while they prepared my breakfast. Once they called my name we got seats and pulled out the goods. I couldn't believe what I was doing. I was eating a work of art! The croissant alone was worth it. It was fresh, warm and flaky. I fell in love instantly. They also added the right amount of cheese (did I mention I love CHEESE) to make the sausage and egg not disappear. This was the egg sandwich I have been searching for my entire life. This place gets a well deserved five stars. I strongly recommend and true Yelper, head over here and see if I'm wrong.", "author": "Evan C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-25", "description": "Fuck yes.

Actually, that's the case with most of this chain's locations. This one is near where I used to work so I do find some joy in going here even though it is overpriced. That said, they do have good healthy options for eating small things as opposed to some of the other places in the neighborhood. And the seating, though I've only eaten in once over the past 9 years, is a great simple option. Their egg white salad in particular is top notch. \n\nThe quality of the staff is sporadic though. Never bad enough to warrant a boycott, but questionable enough to halt my visits from time to time. I've thankfully never found the bagels to be bad or even mediocre (though not refuting the other reviewers), and their treats are pretty decent, so when I need a breakfasty meal or some light natural food, I'm all in.

I was craving a sandwich after returning from a particularly disappointing brunch party where the food was no good. \n\nThey have a huge selection of sandwiches, the basic ingredients are the same, the combinations differ.  The bread and bagels they use for their sandwiches are hand made and very nice. They do offer salad options as well and allow you to customize or make your own sandwich.\n\nI had the Italian chicken sandwich which consisted of grilled chicken, grilled pepperoni, peppers and mozzarella. It was quite a huge sandwich, the chicken and other ingredients were good. I wasn't particularly wowed, but wasn't disappointed either.\n\nI had my sandwich to go, the cashier girl was very friendly and helpful, the guy taking the order to make he sandwich not so much. They have some seating space, I've walked by the place quite often and haven't seen it overly crowded.\n\nI will definitely by stopping by again to try another type of sandwich.", "author": "Subodh M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-15", "description": "Love this little neighborhood gem!
