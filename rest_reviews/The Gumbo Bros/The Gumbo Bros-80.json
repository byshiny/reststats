Inside there is a large communal table plus a few bar stools and tables. There is no table service? I'm still confused as to whether or not you're supposed to order at the counter or what. (We did but, really?)\n\nThe food: maybe I'm biased because I've actually been to NOLA but, this place was just not the business. The po-boy was bland. The catfish had a good fry but it was tasteless. And it costs $12  Throughout the restaurant they advertise that they import the same bread used in LA but it's more than the bread that makes the sandwich, in my opinion. \nThe crawfish Mac and cheese was pretty good though. I don't think I would come here again but it was an okay place to eat during a day of running errands in downtown bk.", "author": "Mel B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-17", "description": "Everyone knows you can't go to Trader Joe's hungry (those samples aren't enough!), and the surrounding chain restaurants are never worth the investment. Enter Gumbo Bros, which takes a fast-causal and authentic spin on the New Orleans classics of gumbo and po'boys. \n\nThe gumbo, stewed for over 2 hours, is absolutely delicious! Choosing between the seafood and chicken \u0026 pork sausage was one of the hardest decisions I've ever made. We got the chicken \u0026 pork bowl, which was more than enough for 2. We also got the roast beef po boy. It came with a fresh toasted baguette - shipped fresh from NOLA - and a lightly mayo-ey lettuce, tomato and pickle spread. It was good but missing something..maybe an onion or spicy layer?\n\nOverall, such a great comforting place to pop into!

It is not on the menu but they have it, just ask for it! \n- Chicken and sausage gumbo $12 - the depth and robustness of this gumbo was incredible.  You could definitely taste the time and the labor of love they placed into this dish! As they say, they make their gumbo the old-fashioned way, including their 2 hour roux! \n- Fried catfish po-boy $12 - I particularly love how the bread is soft so it is the perfect vessel to contain fried catfish, when you bite into the po-boy, all the contents stay in place and don't come shooting out.  This is the reason Gumbo Bros ship their Leidenheimer french bread directly from Louisiana!  The fried catfish was not greasy and had a sharp crispy exterior.", "author": "Karen L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-14", "description": "This is by far the best restaurant I've eaten at in Brooklyn.

I have never been louisiana, but this place makes me want to visit real quick. The banana pudding here is also the bomb. You must try that too! I had the chicken and sausage gumbo 2x times already and each time it warms my heart. It is so perfect for cold weather. The wait is kinda longer than expected, but it is worth it because the gumbo is super flavorful. The sausage is my favorite part, but the chicken is tender as well.

Well, today was the day! I've been craving a po boy and I was nearby so I stopped in for a bite. I will say this was the most expensive po boy I've ever had at $13 lol but it did not disappoint. I got a shrimp po boy, a side of potato salad ($4), and a sweet tea ($3). The food was really good and flavorful. The sweet tea was uneventful and barely sweet but the food made up for that. I left happy enough and with my belly full.

I love New Orleans Cajun. It is one of the best things about any city in the US. The gumbo, fish, po' boys, you name it, are all so unique (not to mention delicious). Every once in a while, I find myself craving New Orleans Cajun, but now place in the city really ever fit the mold..until now. \nI've tried Po' Boys from all the highly rated places in NYC, and this was by far the best one. Get the catfish po' boy since 1. It is the most authentic to NOLA style and 2. The obvious reason, it is the best one. The gumbo was also very good.

During lunchtime they had a cup of gumbo and 1/2 a sandwich for $13. The server there was chatting away with the woman in front of me, while I waited for the conversation to be over and then finally ordered. Took quite a while to get my food because there seemed to be like 1 staff back there. \n\nNanny's seafood Gumbo ($6.50)- 2/5  It had a good amount of shrimp in it, which were good. But I wasn't too sure about the flavor, it was a mixture of blandness and pepperiness. \n\nShrimp po' boy ($13)- 4/5  This was good, but nothing spectacular.

When you walk in, there are bench tables set up like a family reunion in Louisiana. That already set the New Orleans vibe and it kind of set the expectations high for me. I knew it had to be authentic and it had to taste REAL. Especially because I just had gumbo nearly a week ago during my trip to New Orleans. The staff was so welcoming, warm smiles, and they gave off this very genuine feeling that they really wanted me to enjoy the food and they really wanted me to give me the total experience and feel of an authentic Louisiana meal. The first bite I had was the seafood gumbo. It had the perfect amount of seafood and spices in the gumbo served under white rice. It was spicy, but not overwhelming go get a cup of water or milk spicy, not runny nose spicy, but more like a pleasant, satisfying kick. The gumbo reminded me of real southern cooking because of the very warm spices in the dark roux . You can tell they didn't some time and hard work on getting the roux to a great taste and texture. I didn't try the chicken and sausage gumbo because I don't eat Park but my friends seemed to enjoy it but said the seafood gumbo was better. I also tried the fried green tomatoes, in which there was  a bit of vinegar taste that made me question if it was a friend green pickle. Whatever was inside this crispy brown batter was perfectly fried and tasted pretty good in this white dipping sauce that came with it. I had the fried chicken sandwich-- loved it because it was juicy and well flavored with this honey mustard glaze. I don't even like honey mustard, but maybe this is how honey mustard is supposed to be done! The last thing I had was the collard greens. I didn't like them much because of the vinegar base and I just don't like vinegar in my collard greens. But I know plenty of my southern friends and family would appreciate it. Apparently vinegar in collard greens is a southern tradition so I won't knock the style. I can say I like the consistency and freshness of the greens and they clearly hand selected only the best collards. Overall, I LOVED my experience and my meal. I went home satisfied and wondering who else in NYC can do it like gumbo bros...
