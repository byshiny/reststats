I was not impressed at all with the pizza or the size of it for the price. I decided to give this place a second try by trying some of the meals on the menu. There is where I as much more impressed. I shared two appetizers and an entr\u00e9e with my bf. All three choices were delicious. My only other complaint was again the portion size. You really cant even share your entr\u00e9e because the portion is small. If I am looking for a good Italian spot but not starving I would definitely give this place  try again. The ambiance at night is also pretty nice.", "author": "Brenna B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-15", "description": "Came here for the first time last Friday and had the meatballs and a couple of pizzas for the three of us.

I truly feel that I need to explain this experience that I just had. I ordered two pizzas thru seamless and received a time of delivery between 6:40-6:50pm. I ordered the pizzas for my twin boys and did not receive my food on time, not even a few minutes late. I called more than 4 times and still no pizza. Mind you I live only two blocks away. It is now 7:27pm, my boys needed to eat more than 30 minutes ago and still no pizza. I am a regular patron and now, I am so disappointed and annoyed that I don't know if it's worth the aggravation. Off to making the boys some home made pasta....", "author": "Caroline P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-02", "description": "I went to Forno Rosso yesterday with my husband and it was mildly busy. We ordered the branzino and the lasagna and our server Oscar was kind enough to inform us of the longer wait for those two items so we added an appetizer. He also gave us a suggestion for wine which me and my husband liked. The entrees were delicious but took quite a while. Good food. Great service!!

On most dates, we discuss work, home, politics, etc. On this date, all we spoke about was how amazing the food was! Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was so flavorful and perfect! We started off with the Eggplant Parmigiano and Baby Artichoke salad. Both were extremely fresh and delicious! The eggplant was baked to perfection. Not too mushy or too tough. All the ingredients were perfectly balanced. The artichoke salad? Divine! Who would have thought that avacado and basil pesto balance the tartness of artichokes so well?! We then had pizzas. I had the Gateux (?) and my husband had the Margherita with the San Marzano sauce. (The dough, we found out doesn't contain any yeast.) Both were so perfectly cooked and flavored! For dessert, we shared the mojito infused Panna Cotta. It was UNBELIEVABLE! Mint in every bite! So fresh and so prefect! I honestly don't know the last time I tasted food that was so delicious, from start to finish.", "author": "Jessica S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-11", "description": "The place decor is awesome, I think food can be A bit better l, customer service is ok.

I ordered iced tea, and since the glass was full of ice I got 2 refills.  When the bill came, I was charged for 3 iced teas, because refills are not free.  Soda refills are free but not iced tea.  Just ridiculous, and I  think the server should have pointed it out when I ordered.  I've never been to a restaurant that charged for iced tea refills, I didn't even get a new glass each time.  I won't go back to a place so cheap they charge $4 for each iced tea.  Kind of ruined if I thought the food was ok, no food is so good that they deserve 4 per REFILLED  glass of tea.

My family and friends have had various pizzas which we always enjoy, but the salads ( INSALATA DI CARCIOFINI, AVOCADO \u0026 PARMIGIANO REGGIANO especially) and the arugula salad are my favorite appetizers and love the lasagna and fettuccine bolognese.
