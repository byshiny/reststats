It's the least delicate of sandwiches. What I mean to say is that within this indelicate sandwich exists a delicate balance...of cheese and steak. And maybe onions and/or mushrooms. \n\nIt needs to be chopped and seasoned right, and the cheese melted in just so. Liquified cheese is what makes a cheesesteak oozy and delicious, which is why whiz is such a popular choice. \n\nPersonally, I prefer a mix of American and provolone, but it still has to be chopped up in there and melted. The cheese on both my steak and the Pork Italian I got was just slapped on at the end, and pretty much unmelted (see photos). \n\nDon't get me wrong, these were both still solid sandwiches, but not up to the top-notch cheesesteak quality that Tony Luke's is known for. \n\nBut the bread is good, the ingredients are right, and the place is still new. I feel confident they'll get it, and I'll finally have a real deal cheesesteak down the street so I can bring heart disease on sooner rather than later.", "author": "Peter D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-08", "description": "I wanted this place to be better so badly. Both for their sake, and selfishly, to promote a culture of cheesesteak competition in Brooklyn.\n\nThis place was supposed to be a no brainer - \"watch out Shorty's, the REAL place is in town now, so step up your game\". That, sadly, didn't happen. First of all, the staff here was super nice when I came in, I didn't have the heart to give them less than three stars, though honestly, it's more like a two star place. \n\nThe main problem? The bread sucks. I mean, these guys are supposed to know better - hell I KNOW they know better as I've been to their spot in South Philly many a time. But ugh, just an awful representation, they should be embarrassed by the bread. The steak was also small, and the guy on the griddle didn't really seem to know what he was doing (I saw them doing training, think they need a bit more).\n\n\nShorty's is still king in Brooklyn. Their steaks cost more, but the dough is from Philly and the steaks there are twice as big....and twice as good.", "author": "Chuck C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-01", "description": "I went to the original Tony Luke's location 2 weeks ago. With that being said, I know what a standard Tony Luke's cheesesteak tastes like.

The staff took about 10-15 minutes to make 1 cheesesteak when the store wasn't even crowded at all. \n\nJust do Brooklyn a favor and close.

It's a basic to go place with no seating, but you can stand and eat your food. Eh...:. Not for me when I'm super hungry. \n\nI had a beef steak with American and onions.

They are in Brooklyn and they sell philly cheese steaks from a familiar haunt in my cousin's neighborhood.  As I sit here with a scratched up mouth like I ate apple jax or another rough textured cereal, I wished I couldve give more stars.  I really do.\nThe cashier was very professional, with a relaxed demeanor. Good sign. I kept it simple. Whiz it wit, a standard. If you can make this right, other sandos can become an option.  My sandwiches ready in about 3 minutes which was a pleasant surprise and a red flag at the same time. I went over to the counters (there are no seats) and took a bite. I was so sad that all I tasted was cold, stiff bread with a hint of overcooked, dry beef and a skim of wiz. Mind you, I am starving and I still couldn't chew the damn sandwich, lol. \nThe cashier was obviously annoyed with this issue and asked them to remake it properly. Two dudes came from the back making all sorts if nonsensical excuses, until they touched  it. Then the trainer guy comes out and does a little of the same but stands firm that they better fix it. It was begrudgingly remade, and of course I tried it out immediately.  I didnt have the heart to tell them it was slightly better due to the temperature. All else remained.  I have some advice for the biz.\n\n1. Check your grill. It may not be getting to the temperatures that is infamously associated with Philly Cheesesteaks.\n2. Stop pre-making meat, it is cold and super dry.  Even big chain stores make them to order unless the grill is old and well seasoned with 10 orders on deck. \n3. Add a bit more meat.  The bread shouldn't overpower the flavor of the sando. You have serious competition less than 3 blocks away.\n4. Buy a breadbox, like the corner store has to maintain the freshly baked quality.  You will save yourself money and preserve quality.\n5. Stop letting the two guys who defend poor quality talk to customers, it may infuriate the average Brooklynite. \n6. Step back, watch the masters do it at the original store and trust the process.\n\nFin.", "author": "Farrah B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-08", "description": "This is Tony Luke's first restaurant in NYC from its renowned Philly location. Having never visited the OG Tony Luke's (and having a fairly low cheesesteak IQ), I'm not sure how this location ranks comparatively. But, I did eat a pretty delicious sandwich, on fresh bread, and for a reasonable price. \n\nThe restaurant itself is on a busy corner and has a decent amount of eat in space. The menu is simple, and includes everything at their OG location sans the chicken cutlet hoagie. \n\nFor my first trip, I decided to keep it simple with the classic beef cheesesteak with American cheese and grilled onion. They used white American that actually looked like sliced cheese rather than a gooey orange slab - I really appreciated this! I was also pretty impressed with the quality/freshness of the bread.\n\nI wouldn't come here anticipating a life changing cheesesteak experience, but it seems to be a reliable choice for a craving. I'm definitely coming back to sample more of the menu!", "author": "Katey G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-04-17", "description": "Not as good as Philly, staff was more playing around and forgot my sandwich and it was rapidly put together my famous pork sandwich and forgot the cheese I paid for.

Decent amount of people in there, which was nice to see. Since they make everything fresh but the bread, I imagine that there will always be a bit of a wait. \n\nOrdered the beefsteak wit whiz (the only way to eat cheese steak, in my opinion), a chicken with provolone (because we thought our 4yo would like it), and bacon cheese fries. \n\nAfter about a 7 minute wait, we received our food and went home. (Everyone working there was very friendly.) \n\nUpon opening our food, we discovered that were given a beefsteak with provolone as our second sandwich. That was very irritating at the time because a) I was hangry and b) I was excited for our daughter to try the chicken. \n\nBut everything was good. Our cheese steak was great and we added some mayo to hers and she liked it, too. The fries were the big stand out - really excellent. The bacon was really good, too. Ample amount of cheese included. \n\nI called and let them know that we received the wrong sandwich. The manager apologized and offered to make it right. \n\nI considered 4 stars because of the mistake, but it was their first day. Unless they make the same mistake again, I feel comfortable recommending Tony Luke's at 5 stars. \n\nAs a side note for comparison, Shorty's was previously our closest cheese steak option. The fries at Tony Luke's are better for sure. I think the sandwiches are comparable in quality and flavor, but $9.99 vs $13 is going to win out every time, even though their sandwich is smaller. It might be perfect for us because I can finish the Tony Luke's and not feel terrible about how much I ate while saving a few bucks.", "author": "Benjamin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-05-28", "description": "Ordered the Philly with Provolone, it had no flavor, very bland, very disappointed.

The portions were right, the ingredients were tasty, and while the location has no seating (only counters and limited space), I can't really expect too much more from a corner cheesesteak joint. \n\nI ordered the traditional cheesesteak with American cheese and \"wit\" onions. You can go with the Whiz if you choose, but I liked the American because it's a little less salty than Whiz, and blends a bit better than provolone. Just my opinion.\n\nThe roll was phenomenal--a nice and tender chew that didn't force me to chomp away at my sandwich like a lion chomps on a gazelle in the jungle. The meat was incredibly flavorful and as I mentioned, the cheese and onions complimented it extremely well.\n\nWhat really clinched it for me, though, was that I didn't feel like I needed to reach for a defibrillator after I finished. These sandwiches are not healthy by any stretch, but sometimes a cheesesteak can be nothing more than a Nuclear GreaseBomb that practically falls apart in your hands before declaring war on your digestive tract. Everything on my Tony Luke's sandwich was tucked into the roll properly so it wasn't too messy, too greasy, or too heart attack-y.

The customer service from the girl on the register was A1... she was nice.

I didn't see the onions, I'm assuming they were cut up with the beef.  The amount of meat was sad - like two ice cream scoops worth of mixed meat and cheese for a hero sandwich.
