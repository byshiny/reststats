Quick hop off the A train first stop in Brooklyn. The value for dollar at this place puts most Manhattan wine bars to shame. And the food is top notch from salads to bone marrow. Also one of the best scotch lists around. Great vibe and close to St Ann's Watehouse!", "author": "Mikel R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-01", "description": "Brunch was bad. Came here with my family, never been to the place before. While the menu looked appetizing, the actual delivery was poor. Eggs came cold, kale was tasteless and watery. The only edible thing on a plate was toasted sourdough.

When we came in, the place was not particularly crowded but as soon as it was about halfway filled, the servers were frantic. \n\nThe waitress was fine but never checked on us. She  too appeared frantic and disengaged. \n\nWhat's more, the main server continued to turn parties of 2 away (refusing to split tables to do so) in favor of bigger parties (presumably?). In fact, a couple who already ordered and had to come inside because it was chilly, were forced to wait for a table for 2 with others who hadn't ordered. How strange. \n \nThe food was *fine*. Nothing to write home about, so I won't. \n\nWe waited a good 25-30 minutes after we finished to get our check. I had the feeling we could have left and they wouldn't have noticed. But not to worry, we paid over $100 for 3 drinks, an app, and two sub-par entrees.

I had a really tasty and well cooked lunch for $15 half chicken panini and hot peas cream soup.  The other choice was portobello panini and cold cucumber soup.  \nClean, nice, fare prices, well served and the most important - tasty food! \nAlso need to admit a very convenient location close to the A train subway station.

This spot is relatively closeby and a bit more inviting than the usual dimly lit wine bars.\n\nGot a half-carafe of Montepulciano ($27) and a side of Home Fries ($4). The dark red was perfect after freezing our asses off outside, especially sitting next to the window and seeing others trying to brave the cold while we got warm. Home fries were nicely seasoned, going well with the red.\n\nService here is solid. They didn't try to rush us out despite just having a side and a drink.

Great place to have dinner on a random week night, where you won't feel guilty for spending a fortune. This place is neighborhood, and cozy and delicious! My favorite meal is by far the boar ragu! It's amazing,really! The gnocchi tastes like delicious little pillows that are perfect to absorb the deliciously slow cooked sauce while the boar simply melts in your mouth. Their wine selection is respectable, and a good value. The service has always been great as well. \nDefinitely a place you want to put on your regular rotation!", "author": "Si\u00e1nneth S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-15", "description": "Amazing wine selection at reasonable prices!

But it has the largest selection of great whiskeys I've ever seen.  And the wines by the glass are the opposite of plonk.  I mean, amazing gems from a private cellar.  The food is great - who knew?  Well, those in the know, know that one of the owners is the owner of the nearby Henry's End, which is a food mecca in Brooklyn.

Recently, I have found a glorious bartender here on Saturday nights. Attentive and perfect. Tonight I came in, and the dude who was here who didn't even notice me for over 30 minutes!!!

I ordered the roasted chicken panini. The panini came on a house made baguette with a chipotle goat cheese, arugula, and prosciutto. It was exactly what I hoped it would be. It came with a mixed green salad that was perfectly dressed and seasoned and house made potato chips. I'm giving it 5 stars cause the food is worth the price. The service is very friendly and inviting but it's slow. Maybe it's just today. There was one server on the floor who is also the bartender. There was another person who was bussing/hosting. I'm not knocking the place at all for this but just trying to leave a clear review.
