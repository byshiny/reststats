I knew that there was a famous pizza place near the Brooklyn Bridge but other than that I was flying blind. But when we got off the subway we gravitated towards it before we did the touristy trek across the bridge, and I'm glad we did. We waited about 20 minutes outside at around 4:00pm, which wasn't so bad, but I can see why people would get pissed about that.\n\nWe were crammed into a table in the front right corner, furthest from the action but also away from foot traffic so we didn't get bumped or anything. Four of us split a large pie with sausage, pepperoni and...something else, God knows what, and a bottle of red. The pizza was unreal and the wine was just enough to get us warm for the windy walk across the bridge. I probably wouldn't wait two hours for it, but we lucked out and I'm glad we did.", "author": "Adrian C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-13", "description": "Wow, there are some weak-ass one-star reviews for this place. Giving it 1 star because you live near it and don't want to have to walk through the crowd? C'mon... or giving it 1 star because of the fact that it's in Brooklyn and then saying \"See my review of another place\"? WEAK!\n\nBottom line: This place serves great pizza. \"It's just pizza!\" you say? Well, isn't that what we're reviewing here? A pizza joint? Yeah, I think we are. I'm pretty sure we are. Hold on, maybe I'm not so sure, let me check....\n\nOh yeah, we are. Definitely. It's definitely a pizza place. So if you went there for filet mignon, you're an idiot.\n\nBack to my review:\nI've been to Grimaldi's many times and it's consistently excellent. I've intentionally only visited when I knew I would not have to stand in line, so I assure you that my experiences were with a clear head.\n\nIt's a simple place and a simple pizza, but done to perfection. The staff take your order quickly, and you get served quickly. The crust has the right amount of crispy, slightly-burned edges. The sauce and cheese, the perfect compliment. Add a few basil leaves, and there you go: it's all you need. Of course, you could get a topping or two, and that would be fine. If you want a reasonably-priced Brooklyn Lager or glass of red wine, you can get either.\n\nSo if you want to take a nice stroll over the Brooklyn Bridge, swing by here for a meal. Come early, of course.\n\nIf you've been to Brooklyn to bitch and moan about it, don't come back.

On Saturday I spent the entire day in Brooklyn and was exposed to every great thing about that borough.  I never appreciated all that I was missing until that day.  But one thing clearly stood out, Grimaldi's Pizza.  I am almost embarrassed to say it.  I mean, if I see a line of tourists, I immediately look for another place to go.  I am not even all that crazy about pizza -- I usually don't even eat the crust.  Everything about this place just seems wrong for me.  As a couple we would never make it.  My friends would whisper in my ear, telling me that this Grimaldi girl is bad news.  But I have to throw away everything I think I know about food, or at least pizza, because this is the best damn pizza I ever had in my life!  How do I know?  I ATE THE ENTIRE PIZZA BY MYSELF!!!\n\nYes, you read that correctly.  I am a fairly thin guy who is never yielded to gluttony.  And somehow, miraculously, I summoned a ravenous appetite that could not be assuaged.  On my pizza, I had the pepperoni and the garlic.  Sweet, spicy, delicious pepperoni.  Rustically cut, thick, and robust in flavor.  I slavered for this.  But then there was the garlic.   I do not recall ever seeing garlic as an option for a pizza, but it was a brilliant stroke.  Warm roasted fresh garlic made this pizza sing, \"That's Amore\"!  The marriage of such hedonistic tastes was further enhanced by the gentle call of that decadent marinara.  Like a siren leading me not into ruin, but into unabated temptation.  I was more than pleased.  Everything was just right about this pizza.  Even the crust.  The crust!  So light and puffy.  As I was just savoring this experience, they played \"New York, New York\" in the restaurant.  Indeed, I was just having one of those incredible New York days.\n\nNow I am in a terrible predicament.  I have found the best pizza in the world, but it will only see me in Brooklyn, and even then only after I wait an hour in line.  Like glimpsing David for the first time, you are awestruck, but you can never have it to yourself.  You must suffer for the great things in life.  So, only in an effort to make the lines a little bit smaller.  Stay away from this place.  The pizza is terrible here.  Leave me alone to eat all of it by myself!", "author": "Jim U."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-07", "description": "I was in New York with a group of friends from Portland , OR. My boyfriend and I made the trip from Manhatten to Brookyn on the Subway, and it was really worth the trip for great pizza.\nWe got the an hour before they opened, and we had to wait . I really thought it was so nice of the owner to come outside and offer a chair to my boyfriend so he could sit. I really think that was a kind gesture and thoughtful.  Everyone was nice in the restaurant. \nMost importantly, the pizza was great. I am glad I had some great pizza before leaving New York.", "author": "Wes K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-05", "description": "Worth the wait, the price, the everything lol. We were tourists that had to have this pizza. We went the day after Christmas and there were no lines. There was a few ppl ahead of us and we were told to wait outside. It was extremely cold with rain and flurries and I had a baby in a stroller. The manager (I think he was) brought us in and took us upstairs out of the cold to wait. I was treated very nicely and the managers were extremely nice and conversed with us a lot. I didn't care that it took one hour to get our pizza because it was soooooooooooo gooooood. Cooked to perfection!!! The pizzas are well done so if u like that---you will love it.

Sweat starts to drip down your forehead. You start to get a lump in your throat and drink a glass of water. Your brain starts to go into hyper-drive. \n\nYou start to remember that you and T came on a very sunny, Monday afternoon. You both thank god that your friend's apartment, where T was staying, is only three blocks away. When you arrive at Grimaldi's, both of you are a little perplexed because there are only three people standing outside. This couldn't possibly be, could it? No line for Grimaldi's? No, there was no line. And within two minutes, you are already sitting at a table.\n\nYou recall ordering an extra cheese and mushroom pie. As you're looking around, seeing all the Frank Sinatra memorabilia, you start to wonder if maybe Grimaldi's is a front for the Mob. HA HA HA HA - of course it isn't (and if anyone from the Gambino family is reading, you have absolutely nothing against them. They are strictly businessmen). \n\nWhen the pie comes, you both start to eat a bit of the fresh basil. And then you both start eating the slices. And you both think to yourselves, \"yes, we believe that we have now found the best pizza in New York.\"  Even the tourists from California who are sitting next to you agree with you. You all laugh when the woman from California explains that she's originally from Brooklyn and that California wishes they had pizza as good as this. And you all laugh, at California's lack of good pizza. \n\nWalking out, stomachs about to burst, you and T just look at each other, in utter amazement that you both finished the pie. Yes, a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge was most needed right about then. \n\n\"Wait,\" T yelled out, \"isn't there a place called Jacques Torres around the corner?\" Intrigued, your eyebrow goes up, a la The Rock, because you know what The Jacques is cooking.", "author": "roderick A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-29", "description": "This is just one of those New York things you have to do.  Walking the Brooklyn Bridge, getting lost once you go over the bridge (or maybe that was just us?), and then waiting in line forever to get pizza.  It's kind of fun when you're in line with tourists and everyone is a Grimaldi's virgin, having no idea what to expect and just really hungry and excited to get inside.  JR, Christina, and I did this last summer - Christina with a busted knee hobbled across the bridge for pizza.  And she felt it was worth it, so that should be inspiring.\n\nBut go once and leave it at that.  \n\nGo knowing that it's going to be an \"event\" that's great to bring tourists along for.  They won't mind the crowds as much as you will, and they'll be so excited to try \"the best pizza.\"  Don't even try to make cute conversation with the waiter...because I think he kind of wanted to kill me when I asked about what he would recommend.  \"Lady, what do you want?  You guys ready yet?\"  Well, now that I'm officially scared, okay...sinks into the seat.\n\nThe pizza was delicious.  Coal fired...thin, amazing.  Charred crust isn't always the tastiest, though.  And if you want my honest opinion? Better quality of coal fired pizza and same idea at Luzzos or Una Pizza in the East Village.  Grimaldi's is delicious, but come prepared for the experience most of all.  It left our dude saying \"What's with all the hype?
