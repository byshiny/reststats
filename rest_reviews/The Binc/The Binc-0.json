My favorite was Pacific Crest Trail which was jalape\u00f1o infused tequila drink and Fiona apple which is a bourbon based drink.\nTheir Midnight oil drink was quite interesting.. it actually had Wasabi and Ginger!!! Can you believe that!!!\nWe also ordered their garlic fries which was yummy!!

Unfortuantely, we were both disappointed (we've had our fair share of NYC burgers). \n\nThe bar and atmosphere is awesome. Dark, cozy, romantic date spot. We sat at the bar and service was spot-on. Their artichoke appetizer was delicious (but very small portion). \n\nAnywho, let's go back the Binc Burger. The burger was quite dry and under-seasoned, the bun was way too doughy for the thin beef patty, while the fancy cheese they used didn't seem to add anything to the experience. Could've used some acidity, if you don't mind be being a pretentious burger snob. I was just expecting more considering how patrons and the establishment seem to showcase the shit out of this burger. \n\nOn the first bite, one can immediately tell that the beef quality is nothing up to par with the likes of Brindle Room (East Village) or even two8two (Cobble Hill) or Long Island Bar (also on Atlantic) which are in the area. If you're looking to eat a delicious burger, head to those spots! \n\nAlso, all burgers at a place like this should include a side of fries. Don't charge extra. They were good though. \n\nCome for the atmosphere and drinks. Nothing more. \n\nGood night.", "author": "Scott G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-27", "description": "Four stars on the food and five stars on the ambience and drinks here - the epitome of a sweet, intimate and cool spot to come for a date or hangout with a friend that you know will be filled with juicy relationship details and life ponderings. \n\nHad a crispy Peroni at the marble bar and we split the sriracha wings, fries with garlic and Parmesan, and quinoa-asparagus bowl. \n\nAll were very good - not groundbreaking but great compliments to feeling tipsy. The wings were the standout and tasted like sesame chicken at a Chinese restaurant which was satisfying with my beer! I'm not dying to go back but I'd definitely come back for a last-min get together.", "author": "Bonnie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-05-15", "description": "Great place for happy hour in the neighborhood.

They had decorated the whole bar and it had a spooky vibe. I tried a few cocktails off their special menu and really enjoyed them. Nicole the bartender was super helpful in describing the drinks. One of them was a take on a Trinidad sour which I didn't know existed, but using some pumpkin related ingredient. It was one of the most interesting drinks I've ever had and absolutely delicious. \n\nI also got the chance to try some of the food. I ordered a burger, medium rare, which came out perfectly cooked and delicious. I got about half way through until my girlfriend arrived and gobbled up the rest, remarking on how good it was. We also went with the meat and cheese plate which we liked. I would 100% recommend asking for extra bread because you're going to need it. It was pretty dark so I couldn't tell exactly what the cheese were but there was a salty probably Italian cheese, a milder cheese, and something what was definitely goat or sheep's milk based. The meats looked like some sopresta and maybe speck or prosciutto. Overall a solid meat and cheese plate for $21. \n\nI'll definitely be back here in the future. From the other reviews it sounds like I need to make sure to hip up happy hour, $8 for a cocktail here is a bargain.", "author": "Matthew R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-30", "description": "Fun cocktail bar with pretty good happy hour deals.\n\n$8 basic cocktails until 7:30 and $4 Gansett bottles (didn't even know that was a thing).\n\nThe Manhattan was great and strong. The Vodka Southside was simple but delicious. Our bartender Nicole was awesome.\n\nThey share a bathroom with Bevacco and there are only two, so if it's busy, it might be a bit of a wait.\n\nAlso the last Tuesday of the month is Tiki Tuesday!", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-03-15", "description": "There is one great bartender left.

Low lighting, music is at a low volume, booths \u0026 bar seating. All around divine.\n\nI had the Raspberry Road. It was perfection.\nMy companion found a really delicious mezcal-based drink.\nThey have a lot of beer and wine offerings.\nAll the drinks were tasty and they were served in fun glasses with pretty garnishes.\n\nEmployees were attentive without being overbearing and seemed like they were always up for a good conversation or an encouraging word in regards to the menu.\n\nDrinks on the menu were $14. Allowing the bartender to make you a surprise drink (you choose the liquor and then let them go to town) runs $15. They may also have small plates?\n\nThis place is the jam.

Vodka drink with mint doesn't sound fancy or special, but it finds a way to be exactly that. All other drinks on happy hour awesome as well.

I was asking the bartender what they recommended on the menu and they actually made a custom made cocktail based off my likes/dislikes. It turned out great and even my friend's Hatchet Jack was made perfectly. I then ordered the Isla Calavera and was surprised how smooth it went down for a tequila drink. We also shared a Hatchet Jack that had a complex taste, but worked really well in the end.\n\nThe way the bar is setup is great to have a conversation with another person, so we ended up staying longer and that started to cut into my dinner. I ordered the pastrami tacos and cheese plate, but was completely let down by both. The pastrami tacos had a strange aftertaste while the cheeses included on the plate were a bit harder than we would have liked.
