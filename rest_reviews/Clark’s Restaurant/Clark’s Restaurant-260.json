However my dentist is near Clark's.  I always go to Clark's  and it makes going to the dentist more pleasurable. Without a doubt Clark's is the best diner I have gone to and is heads above the wide selection in NYC. The staff is professional, pleasant and very attentive. The decor is a step above most diners.  The food is plentiful, well presented and quite tasty.  I had a steak sandwich tonight that was the best I've ever had. Their ice coffee is very good and not diluted by too much ice. Obviously I am quite a fan.  Give it a try if you're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Pat R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-14", "description": "This is your typical run of the mill diner.  Probably only diner you are going to find in the area.  I was craving some breakfast for dinner and they certainly delivered, albeit the waiter didn't write down any orders for a table of 8.  I ordered waffles with strawberries and pancakes and only got the waffles.  The waffles were delicious. I usually don't go for whipped cream, but they were excellent paired with the strawberries.  When I let the waiter know he forgot the pancakes, he was very apologetic, which was very nice.  Otherwise I had a good time.  I was able to get a table as soon as I walked in, so that was nice.", "author": "Thomas F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-12", "description": "One of my go-to restaurants in Downtown Brooklyn. The staff is friendly and the food is what you expect. It's a classic diner with a tastier flare. I really love their breakfast items, like the omelets and eggs Benedict. It's not ridiculously priced either.", "author": "Eric L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-17", "description": "I've been going to Clark's for 14 years and it's still the best diner in Brooklyn Heights.  The place isn't very big so if you want breakfast on Saturday and Sunday - expect a wait and to be seated real close to the next party.  But the food is fresh and the service is fast and courteous.  I recommend the french toast - sweet cinnamon tasting goodness.", "author": "Clarissa H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-09", "description": "Best Diner in the Heights without question.\n\nIm here at least a couple times a month. Great for breakfast, brunch, lunch. Typical diner menu, but above average quality.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a diner the only downsides are that it is not 24 hrs, and I think they're closed Sundays.", "author": "Geoff C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-15", "description": "I love this restaurant ! The waiters are very nice! We all had pancakes and they were delicious!

This is the place that you need to try. I have tried several different types of omelets, burgers, and the sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. They are all delicious, but the breakfast food is the best. They give you a mini shot of freshly squeezed orange juice with your breakfast...let's just say you'll be ordering a large one later. This place is amazing, affordable, and family owned. What is there not to like?", "author": "Robyn S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-09", "description": "This is an odd little restaurant. I'd love to point out that for my table we had two menus, one saying it started in 1987 and the other said 1897. It created a hilarious conversation.\n\nAnyway, food variety is incredible, everything you can imagine that falls within the realm of american, italian and contemporary food. Price was reasonable and food was good, nothing spectacular though.\n\nThe atmosphere is so-so, a lot of college students go there in big groups which can be obnoxious. Certainly not a first date location. But it is a great place to sit and people watch, love the big windows.", "author": "Darren G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "Stopped by to get some breakfast to go. Didn't notice any prices on the breakfast menu, but ordered a wrap and a large coffee. $12.95. Ouch. Wrap was good, but had a slice of tomato, a slice of cheese, maybe two pieces of bacon, and I guess there were some egg whites in there. It was very tasty, but again, $9.95? Coffee was fine. People working there seemed nice, but I'll never come back here for breakfast, at that price, again.", "author": "Samantha G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-28", "description": "Let me start off by saying the lentil soup was like molten lava and burned all of the taste buds from my mouth and tongue.  With that being said, the prices are decent and I had the chicken picata.  I think it needed a bit of salt but I couldnt tell because of the missing taste buds.  Overall not too bad, just your average place for a good meail.", "author": "Jeramy P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-27", "description": "Love this restaurant.

Nothing amazing to report - the french toast was decent. Best thing about this place is the service. I swear they are telepathic, my food was on a rocket out of the kitchen.
