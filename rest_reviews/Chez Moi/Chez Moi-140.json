It's on a street with several nice restaurants near the river. We didn't have a reservation but they were very kind about it,  perhaps especially because it was only 6 o'clock. Soon the restaurant became quite full and had a variety of middle-aged and thirties couples there. The restaurant was very reasonably priced, as was the wine list, and yet the quality was extremely high. We had mussels and steak tartare. The former were in a Dijon broth which was just right and the steak tartare was not full of mayonnaise. We felt right at home and would love to have the restaurant in our neighborhood in Manhattan!", "author": "John V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-03", "description": "Went there for brunch and it was delicious!

Long, full bar with hardwood, small seating area and a few sidewalk tables as well. I came here with a friend after work after seeing their sign for oyster happy hour. Now if you follow my reviews, you know how much I love oysters! I could eat my weight in them if I only had the cash :-). \n\nTheir bar selection is excellent, with refreshing Kronenberg beer on tap that pairs well with seafood. As far as cocktails go, I'd recommend their Jolie - it's a gin drink with vermouth that is crisp, light, and perfect for a hot summer day. I very much enjoyed the oysters (from WA State and Long Island). The kitchen did get a bit backed up, resulting in a 45 minute lag time between placing our order and the oysters arriving. However given the quality of their menu and the great atmosphere, I can easily overlook this.

The first time I had it, it was made perfectly. The 2nd time I had it, the texture/flavor/crunch was somewhat off. (From the first experience) On the initial bite, the octopus was perfectly crispy with a pinch of salty taste. As you bite into it, it becomes so soft and tender that it melts in your mouth. \n\nI had the Wild Skate fish, and it is more on the sour side. It was delicious and the potato foam was a great complement. \n\nHad the chocolate mousse and ended dinner there. Portions are small. Service was great!!! The waitress did not mind at all taking her time to answer all our curious questions about the food.", "author": "S L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-01", "description": "I really, really wanted this place to give Colonie a run for it's money...but alas this was not the case for me and my husband. Walking into the restaurant gave me an excited feeling....oh la la everything had a very French feel to it (even our hostess who sat us down had a French accent) and they were playing 'French Caf\u00e9' music.....the ambiance is definitely a 5-star! The food on the other hand was comme ci comme \u00e7a ... which is why my rating feel down to a three (sigh). At this moment I want you to google the image of a \"croque monsieur\"...you can see the meat right? Well, I ordered the croque monsieur and my husband ordered the croque madame (it just has a poached egg on top) ...both sandwiches only had a slice of meat and honestly tasted like a grilled cheese sandwich.

They had 2  choices of oysters, both were tasty, well chucked, and with yummy horseradish on the side. This (and the great service - granted there were only 2 other tables) earned them 4 stars if the rest of our meal wasnt ordered.\n\nFrom here things went south. We ordered the tuna tartar and garlic fries...simple staples that you really cant mess up...or so we thought...fries were hot but flavorless (all the garlic collected at the bottom) and tuna was oversalted with a poor ratio of tuna to avocado. Such a shame because it looks delicious...\n\nAs i said, we plan on returning with hopes this time was just a rushed fluke", "author": "Donna K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-09", "description": "Croque Monsieur: it is simply not ok to make one using rye bread.

We've been greated by people knowing how to make you comfortable.\nOrdered french onion soupe and a hamburger. Both were good, even the meat was a bit cold (i asked for it to be cooked rare, but i'd have liked to get it hot as well).\nThen ordered a tarte tatin and profiteroles. The tarte tasted more than a \"chausson aux pommes\" with apple puree on a flaky paste. Was pretty good, but definitly not a tarte tatin. Profiteroles were good, but the chocolate was too cold and wasn't liquid anymore when it came too us. The hot chocolate must be served on the choux once the plate is in front of the customer, otherwise that's what happens, cold and \"hard\" chocolate. Thae taste was here anyway. The choux were good, as the vanilla ice cream.\n\nThe 2 people who served us were delighful.", "author": "Arnaud W."}], "servesCuisine": "French", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Chez Moi", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "135 Atlantic Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UObIvpFYpJjYG8cTU_91gQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+13472278337"}
