Kotti Berliner Doner Kebab is situated all the way in the back in a very inconspicuous stand, but clean and modern. \n\nI know that kebabs and middle eastern food are a big \"fast food\" thing in Germany, but I'd never had it directly in Germany. I'm on a special \"diet\" for the month, so it eliminated a lot of choices for me in the market hall. The Doner salad sounded perfect for me. \n\nIt looked really good, but I was shocked at how absolutely scrumptious this meal was. The salad had loads of fresh veggies (cabbage, onions, cucumbers), greens, and their super tender well-seasoned chicken shawarma, drizzled with their special yogurt sauce and harissa. It wasn't just amazingly tasty but actually filling and satisfying. I'm sure to drop by here again! Highly recommended! My husband had gotten something else and was disappointed. He agreed my salad was extra delicious.", "author": "R. H. J.

It was towards the end of the night admittedly so maybe I got the last of it, but the meat was pretty tough. Salad ingredients were fresh though.

This is THE spot in Dekalb Market, if not all of Brooklyn. I was blown away with the D\u00f6ner here. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The veggies were cool and fresh, the bread was crisp and soft at the same time, but DAT SAUCE... RIDICULOUS. They have a red and white sauce that combines together to be heavenly.

This is definitely as close as you're going to get to Hasir (my favorite d\u00f6ner place in Berlin, though even the \"bad\" ones I had in Kreuzberg were pretty great :) ). As other reviewers have said it is a little bit pricey, but I'm sure people in the area can afford it and you can tell this isn't your average, sweaty, amorphous cylinder meat. I would probably go every day or every other day if there was an option between $5-$7 (like a lower quality meat option? Idk), and if they had Spezi/Mezzo Mix/Schwip Schwap I would come through just to get a bottle", "author": "Benjamin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "The kotti salad with extra chicken is absolutely delicious.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. That has nothing to do with a D\u00f6ner at all. The meat is completely different and they don't even make their bread on their own. The D\u00f6ner and also D\u00fcrum was a bit cold. Normally you get the meat fresh and hot from the spit. Here they will cut it and grill it I guess to reheat it. You won't get D\u00f6ner here just a way overpriced chicken sandwich!

I was curious and interested today to try the new rice bowl. All I can say is that they really need to work on their quality control. All of the chicken in the bowl was very dry. Even worse, almost half of the chicken was literally burnt so crusty and black that it was inedible. If I hadn't already taken it home to eat it, I would have returned it.
