Last night, after coming from drinks with friends, I desperately needed something quick and relatively healthy for dinner - and this fit the bill.\n\nI honestly felt bad, because they were 15 mins from closing (but to be fair, I asked repeatedly if they are still open!). My order was the spicy tuna bowl, and it came with some edamame, some sliced cucumbers, generous serving of rice, spicy tuna, and because I was the last order of the night - some salmon sashimi too. YUM.\n\nThey were also kind enough to give me 10% off as a first-time customer (since he couldn't locate the discount card for a future visit). The food was fresh, the service was quick and I'm glad we have new food options in the area.", "author": "Shu Jin S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-02-11", "description": "This is a good place to get fresh and quick sushi to go. I live next door so I'm glad this place opened up as there isn't this type of cuisine in the area without having to go to Dekalb Hall.  I removed one star because it is a bit on the price side but this will definitely be in my regular rotation\n\n\nUpdate: I unfortunately have to downgrade to three stars. I paid over $15 for a snow crab bowl which is mostly rice and very very little crab, and two small pieces of shrimp. I just don't think that's worth $15.  I think they need to figure out the portion sizes if they are going to charge these prices, and then maybe it'll be worth it.", "author": "shana l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-23", "description": "A new sushi spot with a very interesting sushi line up. They got some very unique sushi rolls offered which are out of the box from your traditional sushi restaurants.\n\nI got the Sriracha Salmon and Shrimp Mango Avocado. The Sriracha Salmon Roll was intriguing as it is not like the traditional Spicy Salmon Roll you can typically get. This I presume is salmon soaked is Sriracha sauce so you get that sweet and spicy taste all in a roll. I'm a fan of it. The Shrimp Mango Avocado roll when you first look at it, I thought of how proportionate the roll was, barely a sliver of mango in the roll. Once you pop in the roll into your mouth, you can taste the mango being complementary with the shrimp and avocado flavors. A perfectly balanced flavorful roll. Each roll is cut into 8 pieces.\n\nThey offer other items if you're not that into sushi such as rice bowl and salads, although very limited in selection. I am looking forward to trying the other rolls they have to offer next time.\n\nP.S.

It's in the vein of Bondi, in that there are set combos, prepared fresh and quickly. Here though, there is also nigiri plus a few other options, like a Sashimi Salad and a Sashimi Bowl. I tried the sushi bento for ($14), which comes with 3 delicious pieces of nigiri and one roll.\n\nA construction worker just walked in asking if they had shrimp tempura and walked out sad, so hopefully they find the crowd they deserve for a good fast casual spot.", "author": "Mike C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-15", "description": "Really fresh, high quality sushi, and super creative vegetarian sushi. \n\nThis area is pretty lacking in high-quality sushi--we ever only go to Hibino and Dekalb's Daigo handroll. So it's sad to see other reviewers complain about price, since you really need to use the right comps. BigEye is actually more bang for your buck in comparison. I'd love to see what they think of Daigo, where you'd get an amazing handroll but for $8 apiece.  \n\nEven better is they say they source sustainable fish, and they've got a great array of Japanese snacks and drinks in the shop.", "author": "Ash C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-11-14", "description": "Bigeye Sushi is good for my big mouth! Came here after work on a weekday and was one of the only customers inside. My partner and I shared three rolls - california ($7), shrimp mango avocado ($8) and yellowtail jalapeno ($8). The price is right, and we were both very impressed with the freshness of the seafood/rolls. You can add rice cracker crunch to any roll for 50 cents. We had this added to the shrimp mango avocado roll. It added a nice crunch but wasn't really necessary. Sidenote: I totally missed the free miso soup deal on Yelp so take advantage of that if you can. The storefront is small but bright and clean, and there's a row of seats to dine in.

I was skeptical when I saw $14 for one roll + three pieces of sushi. As expected, they handed me one underwhelming roll and three pieces of sushi.... for $15 with tax. I was starving and famished after forking over the money and swallowing the single roll.\n\nFor $15 you can walk over to an actual sushi restaurant and get a 3-roll lunch special, with miso soup and salad with ginger.\n\nThe speed is good, the quality is good.

It's no doubt that it's pricey but it's relatively quick. I've tried their sushi platter and sashimi bowls. Both are pretty fresh but small in order. They also have snow crab which I've asked specifically if it was imitation crab meat and they said no. It's a pricey order, but for real snow crab, I guess you'll have to pay. For the few times I've been there, it's not a buzzing lunch spot so I hope they will last for a bit and maybe even adjust their prices a little.", "author": "Nilsa L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-11-07", "description": "Great quality but the portion size is not up to standard. I was surprised by how light and insignificant the paper bag felt when I picked up the order of sushi bento. For $14 before tax, it came with 3 pieces of nigiri and one roll in a small sushi takeout box. The nigiri and roll were well made, with fresh yellowtail and well-cooked rice, but each piece was small and weighed perhaps only 2/3 of what could be expected at any other sushi restaurant.\n\nI am not a big person, but I still left hungry after eating lunch here.", "author": "Honver L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-11-30", "description": "Zero stars!!!

This is just a run of the mill  sushi spot. They have basic stuff that is nothing special.

The fish were very fresh., but the roles were a bit simple.

The taste was great but I do have to say I do not like the mechanical way of handling food.  Everything is machine fixed or packed in a pouch.  Also, lets mention the price is type steep for the food.  Overall, taste was good and location a plus.  I would rather it be a sushi bar freshly made by order.  The ginger too was even packaged smh...

I ordered a salmon bento box. Salmon bento box is on the receipt and sticker affixed to the bag. They gave me the wrong order. Also, this place is pricy for the location and for what you get ($15+ for lunch). Other than not getting what I ordered and the cost, the food is fresh. I will probably still go back because there isn't much competing in the area. But next time I'll check to make sure they are giving me what I ordered.

They offer \"boxes\", essentially 3 pieces of sushi and one roll. There's also platter options and sushi bowls. I just finished my meal and it was absolutely delicious - super fresh fish and the rice was the perfect consistency. I'll probably never come back to this place though as they are cashless and just happened to have my girlfriend's credit card on me, which is a rare occurance. Businesses that do not accept cash are discriminatory. Plenty of people do not operate with credit cards, especially those who are lower income.
