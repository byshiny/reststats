There are so many choices in Dekalb food market. I had BBQ on Friday and Lobster for Christmas Eve, I don't want to eat a tremendo pastrami sandwich at Katz, what's left?\n\nFulton Landing Seafood Co!\n\nI saw the counter wasn't too busy. They had a fried fish sandwich special, I was more in the mood for something hot. I choice a seafood crab gumbo with rice. I used my debt card, they utilize Square so it was a simple transaction.\n\nThey put my gumbo in a container with a plastic top. When I went to the bench to sit down, the plastic top warped from the heat. Once I popped the top? The gumbo party dropped. Man, it was on! It was spicy but the crab meat wasn't plentiful and isn't there supposed to be andouille sausage?? For $15 bucks, this lunch was pricey but when you add up the skimpy essential ingredients, I'm gonna pass next time when I'm perusing the various booths.\n\nMy buddy got Pho and was laughing at me.

So kudos for that.\n\nIn terms of food and service, there are a couple of wrinkles that they need to iron out. Their ticketing or back of house systems must need work, because multiple people complained about not getting their orders. I personally watched someone get served before I did when they ordered after me (and we got the same thing).\n\nI went with the octopus roll (never heard of such a thing!). I liked it (a bit salty) and at $15, it's way cheaper than other seafood rolls.\n\nThey do oysters, which is always a plus!\n\nThere are some bar top stools, so grab one of those since the seating at DMH isn't great.\n\nThey're also opening another counter on the side as well.\n\nLook forward to returning!", "author": "Kenny C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-12", "description": "We came to this cute little spot to kill time and catch a drink. We both ordered a beer (by the way they had a very good selection to choose from) and some tater tots. I was excited and thought it was so cute that their menu had tater tots, it's a good bar compliment plus its just not something you see all the time. The menu varied in selections and pricing. Since we were going to have dinner at our next stop after this pit stop we just stuck to something light like the tater tots. However, while we were sitting there at their bar our eyes were a roaming while everyone around us was ordering their food. The plates looked full and nicely cooked - it definitely enticed me to make another trip to try some of the food on their menu.\n\nThe service wasn't the best which was weird for such a small location.  It was just one of those situations where they were too dostracted by each other and their conversations to realize the people sitting around them might want something. Either I'm still intrigued to go back on an upcoming date night.", "author": "Elethia M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-02", "description": "A solid seafood spot in Dekalb market. I've eaten here twice, getting their clam chowder the first time and the clams the second time. (I'm so bad at taking photos in dekalb due to the general lack of cell phone service!) The clam chowder was good, with a balance of all of the ingredients and appropriate levels of seasoning- not under or over salted/peppered. At $9 though, I did it as a stand in for a meal. I think the portion might be a bit small for those with a hearty appetite, but it worked for me. \nThe other night I got the clams, steamed with garlic butter. I got 11 clams (10 opened, 1 still closed that I didn't eat) some toast and a piece of corn for $14- a pretty good value for seafood around here. I was expecting cherry stone clams with smaller meats, but these were larger- each clam was a full bite. They were served in a garlic butter broth/sauce, as opposed to it being something dipped on the side. Overall really good, and I'm sure I'll be back to try more of their steamed seafood dishes. (Hopefully with my camera this time!) A lot of customers seemed to be going for the mussels, that might be my next choice here!", "author": "April H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-12-08", "description": "A lot of gluten free options including fried fish, shrimp, and crab.

I love the peel n'eat shrimp from here but one of the servers texted in front of me for 5 minutes before greeting me or taking my order. Now her and the manager are talking about how she needs to find a job with better hours and no one has checked on the other customers at the bar. From what I can tell the cooks are doing a great job but front of house really, really sucks.", "author": "Indy B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-10", "description": "The food is phenomenal!!!

The seafood here is very fresh but everything is overpriced. \n\nShrimp cocktail (5 shrimp) - $15\nGrilled shrimp on a bed of tatar tots - $15\nCup of Clam Chowder - $9\n\nIf you love your seafood and don't mind digging a hole into your wallet, you will not regret trying out their food!\n\nLong story short - Decent food;Steep price", "author": "Calvin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-13", "description": "I was hungry and my bf chose a different type of fare, so I went for the seafood option.   The prices were pretty good especially for such a trendy place. The way some of the other customers were attacking their plates helped me make the decision to stay along with the very friendly workers that served up a sample of the gumbo I ended up getting.  I will say, for $15, the portion is okay (served with white rice, had a few hard grains in it ).  The flavor was on dire need of a gulf region seasoning like Tony Chacherie's or Joe's, old bay and a touch of liquid smoke.  It is spicy but that's about it.  A very northern take on gumbo.  No bad, not the best.  The service is what made this 3 star go to 4.", "author": "Farrah B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2019-01-08", "description": "Ordered a lobster roll, clam chowder and beer. The roll tastes stale, there are bits of shell in the lobster and the chowder should be called corn starch chowder not clam.

Both these fellas have a load of experience. \n\nSourcing fresh seafood and serving it up daily is a difficult task, but if you do it right it works. The fried Atlantic halibut was a spot-on; hot, moist and crisp. Lobster roll was delectable with the perfect portion, subtly seasoned but not overbearing. \n\nOysters (Taunton Bay from Maine that day) were high-brine but the source is the Maine waters. Super-cold, medium sized and shucked to order. \n\nSeafood market to follow, once open I think I'll add some words. I usually only cook/eat fish if it came off a fishing line from someone I know. I'll be back here.", "author": "Keylime S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-11", "description": "I do love a good lobster roll.

I think the owner/ manager may have served me. It was really good, if the prices were a bit steep for a food hall.\nI just went back yesterday though and had the same exact thing, and the staff obviously haven't been trained in how to shuck oysters... not entirely their fault, but if I'm paying $3.50 per oyster, I want to be able to eat the whole thing and not leave half in the shell because I can't remove it with a wooden stick. \nPout.\nAgain, not really their fault, but having something metal at my disposable to be able to do it myself would have helped a lot.", "author": "Claire T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-02", "description": "My husband and I stopped here for lunch before our movie since the menu at Alamo is not very good.

I'm gonna give it another shot at some point. The grilled octopus roll was tasty and fresh. The best part of it honestly was the bun though which was amazing. My problem with this was the chips.
