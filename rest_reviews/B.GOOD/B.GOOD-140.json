I first discovered b.good in Boston, and was glad to see they opened up a Brooklyn location.  The food is made with all natural ingredients, often local, and they do a great job with healthy but also tasty food.

I absolutely love this place. I think the service is friendly and fast.  I am in love with the avocado kale bowls. The mixture of fresh vegetables and wholesome grains ensures that you dont have to substitute, flavor for a healthy meal. You can get it all in one.

The food is really tasty and unlike a lot of chains, it's healthy, fresh, and uses local produce.  The staff is super friendly (really!), and with their loyalty program, you get a ton of free food.

Burgers, salad bowls, drinks are all excellent and made with inventive combinations of ingredients. Breakfast on the run? Their egg/cheese/bacon sandwich and coffee knocks any deli in the city out of contention. The one time there was a mixup on my order, they credited my app with 6 free grain and salad bowls.

The food is made quickly but always tastes delicious. My 2 year old loves it and so does my 71 year old mother in law does too! Having a healthy but fast meal is perfection with kids.

However, I've eaten here almost 15 times and every single time there is a screw up. One or two items left out of a bowl, an entire sandwich forgotten, generally discombobulated staff. Everyone is very nice and means well and apologizes but somehow this operation must be streamlined! It seems like there are so many (too many?) people working back there for this many mistakes to be made.
