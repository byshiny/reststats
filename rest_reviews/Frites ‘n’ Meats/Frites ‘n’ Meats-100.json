Hell yes.\n\nAll in all, I still ate it, the bun was excellent Soft, fluffy and light, the greens \u0026 tomato was fresh..i had the Angus, with gruyere cheese..but because my burger was burnt, i couldnt taste the cheese.\n\nI did not order the fries as I read comments that they were normal, I was standing next to someone who ordered them and they looked like mcdonalds and not hand-cut. I think I know what hand cut means. Also, why the term belgian? They are not chubby fries, they are long and skinny.\n\nI'm going to give these guys a second chance.

I'm so there! \n\nI started to get worried when I saw the poor reviews for the Frites n Meats truck, but decided to try it out for myself anyways. I LOVED IT! Everything about it! \n\nI arrived at about 12:30 with a couple coworkers and we were pleasantly surprised that there wasn't much of a line. Thank goodness we got there when we did, because once we were done placing our orders the line was much longer. I LOVE ORGANIZATION and this truck has it. You have to place your order by filling out a card and once you get to the truck you just hand it over and pay. Once your order is ready they will call you by your \"Superhero Name\" which you had to indicate on your order card (I was Magnificant M). From beg to end, we waited 15 min. Not bad! And they have cool music playing too while you're waiting for your order (for a split sec, I thought I was at a club!). \n\nNow on to the good stuff .. I ordered the Wagyu \"American Kobe\" Burger ($7.50) on a Brioche bun (you have a choice of that, Potato-Onion, or Sesame Seed) and I got only the toppings that came free with it, Raw Onions, Tomato, Mesclun Greens, Ketchup, \u0026 Mayo. For 75 cents extra, you have your choice of Savory Onion Jam, Garlicky Guac, Applewood Smoked Bacon, or Oven Roasted Tomato. I also got a side of Handcut Double Fried Belgian Frites ($3) w/ a side of Garlic Aioli (50 cents). \n\nThey don''t ask how you want your burger. It looked Medium, which is just how I like mine. Fries w/ the sauce - very yummy! Meal total $11. All worth it for me (even with currently smelling like garlic and onion in the office)! Will I be going back?

You won't (and shouldn't) make it without diving into the addictively delicious cone of frites. I also highly recommend the garlic aioli as an indulgent condiment.\n\nAdd to the delicious food, the incredibly friendly service, philanthropic nature of the owners, being a local small business, and did I happen to mention the FRITES?!?!

Maybe they should carry a gps on them, since there are times when I go searchin', and they decide to go home/don't update their page (trucks in general).\n\nI like it when they're at Trader Joe's in Union Square better, but I wanted some burgers so I made the trip on over here.  They're right in front of Whole Foods (guess they target these types of grocery stores).\n\nIt's always nice to feel included when you're ordering, so there's a stack of menus and sharpies where you can circle what you want.  You choose the bun, patty, toppings, cheese is an extra 75 cents, and other special toppings that don't include your basic ketchup and mustard are for an additional charge as well.\n\nThe simplest and cheapest burger comes out to $5.50.  Now, that's around Shake Shack pricing and though it is bigger, it's not as flavorful (is it because it's grass fed?)  Yes that's \"healthier\" but in the end, a burger's a burger....for the most part.  There's still grease, though, so yum to that.\n\nI wish they reused those cards you write on, but they don't.

I realize an experience at one restaurant shouldn't set the tone for another, but when Frites is part of your name, I expect to be blown away a bit more. Not just say \"well, those were like slightly crispier McDonald's fries.\"\n\nI still have to try the Meats part, but I don't know when that'll be since they don't come by my part of town too often, and after these fries, I'm not as anxious to seek them out as I was before.\n\n* Yes, I could call them fries, but I won't.

I can say this - their ordering process is as brilliant as their name.

Yes - I was that idiot stinking up the office with the smell of yum, but my boss and two others had done the same, so I was theoretically off the hook, right?  My hopes were a bit dashed when I bit into my burger. It was good, but not amazing. The cheese (brie this time) was probably the best part about the flavors co-mingling in my mouth. The fries were crunchy munchy, but were elevated ten-fold by the horseradish aioli dip.\n\nService was so-so. They were nice and all, but my boss ordered her burger sans bread/bun because she can't have gluten; we were very clear with the guy that it could kill her.
