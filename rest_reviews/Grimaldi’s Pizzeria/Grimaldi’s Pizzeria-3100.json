Awesome! The crust was awesome too!

However, it's absolutely not worth the hours of waiting on line outside. \nHere's the menu: pizza, calzone, antipasto (not the salad kind, the meat kind), dessert, and beverages. So after waiting online for hours and either sweating your butt off or being pummeled by wind or rain, you can't get a side salad, garlic bread, pasta - anything! The last time I was there, the pizza took about 20 mins to get to us and we were STARVING, sweaty and exhausted from the wait (my friend was in from out of town and was insistent on trying the famous Grimaldis - I was outvoted). The tables are small and crammed together - so prepare to eat with your purse on your lap and get intimately involved in the lives of your neighbors. The waiters, although efficient, are too busy. There's no sitting and chatting, although you wouldn't want to as the seats are not all that comfortable and it's loud, very loud. I'd much prefer going to one of its competitors any day.\n\nCash only and no parking.", "author": "Michelle M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-08-20", "description": "We waited over an hour to get in and it was not worth the wait.

I took my bf here for his birthday, almost a year ago to the date, and I was pretty disappointed. I knew it was somewhat of a tourist trap, and was okay with waiting in line and expected rushed service and cramped quarters etc.\n\nHowever, what I certainly did not expect was a pizza that was burned on the edges (more than a normal brick oven should be), cheese without a whole lot of flavor or texture and a tomato sauce that had no zest or freshness to it. \n\nAnd - for those of you who have been to Italy (i just went!), this is certainly not a true Italian pie...\n\nI will continue to look for the ultimate pizza..", "author": "Vee V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-18", "description": "The pizza is awesome - thin crust \u0026 cheesy - but be prepared to wait in line.

The hype is beyond what i can understand.  People go there to take pictures of themselves with the pizza; not because the pizza itself is worth 45 minutes outside on line, and then another 30 minutes inside waiting next to a bunch of strangers literally on top of you.\nI had a good time but never again.

I can see how haters \"hate\" the line that you have to go thru to get here - but it's part of the experience!  Forced myself to take a long trek to Brooklyn in 20 degree weather to try a few pies and was not disappointed.  Went for:   fresh mozarella \u0026 basil - and - sausage, mushroom, fresh garlic \u0026 extra shredded cheese.  Both were good. (I highly suggest adding the fresh garlic as it definitely makes the pie worth it...) The pie is best right out of the oven - so I wouldn't do take out as I'm unsure if it would sit well..  Will definitely try to make it back to Brooklyn the next time I'm in town.  I came in early Saturday and the wait was not long at all..  I'm personally a chicago-style pizza gal but Grimaldi's is creepin up close to the top!", "author": "Lor B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-21", "description": "The pizza is delicious but thin. The whole pie is definitely necessary, maybe a 2nd if you're really hungry. The wait can be redic, but if you time it right you're golden. Kind of hard to go there with a large group so I'd avoid that if possible just because the seating can be a nightmare. You likely won't be disappointed, definitely some of the best pizza around.", "author": "Xavier M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-08", "description": "This is by far the best pizza in all of New York City.  I've had a lot of pizza too.  From the kitsch-esque atmosphere of Lombardi's pretty good pizza, to the slices as big as your head up at Coronet's and dozens of 'Famous' Ray's in between.  I've had a LOT of pizza in this Berg.  But I'll tell ya, Grimaldi's will melt your face.  \n\nTucked away under the Brooklyn Bridge, this age-old pizzeria serves up coal-oven pizza at its finest.  I highly recommend getting pepperoni on top because this was some of the freshest most delicious pepperoni I've ever had.  I think it cooks better in the coal oven for whatever reason.  \n\nPizza-lover beware, two things that make this place a BIT of a hassle (and believe me when I say 'bit' because the pizza is so so worth it) is that if it's crowded, make sure it's sunny outside because the only waiting area is out in the street.  Chelsea J and I lucked out on the night we went because even though it was POURING outside, it was dead inside so we sat right down.  Also, it's cash only.  Sort of makes me think they don't want any sort of paper trail...\n\nJust kidding.  But seriously, I would eat here every day if I lived in DUMBO.  If you haven't been and only had delivery (like me for the longest time) make sure you actually go sit in to eat.  Something about the place makes the pizza taste even better.\n\nEDIT -- Right after I posted this I decided to look and see what other people had to say.  I can't believe what my eyes are reading here!  The most major complaint of all?  \n\n\"I HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY TO BROOKLYN!\"\n\nLet's get real folks.  Every single person who complains about that seriously needs a tighter grip on reality.  New York City is FIVE BOROUGHS!  New York City is not just the island of Manhattan.

On my quest to find the best pizza in NYC, I have decided that Grimaldi's, Di Faras \u0026 John's Pizza on Bleeker Street are my top 3...not in that order though :)\n\nThe line, although annoying while standing in it, moves pretty fast.  They pack you in there really close, so don't expect to be able to have privacy with whoever you're going with.  You're sharing a table with the tourists from China.\n\nThe service is fine, but really all they have to do is bring us our drinks, and our pizza, and then leave us alone, so this is virtually fool-proof.\n\nPizza is absolutely incredible.  The crust is great and it's not too thin, as I really don't like paper thin pizza.  Finish your pizza before it cools too much!!\n\nHere is my ONE complaint about this place, and I know it's ridiculous, but someone just has to agree with me on this.  When you order a soda, they give you a 20oz bottle, with a glass of ice.  But no straw.  Let me repeat: no straw.  I don't know if this is common, but I can NOT drink out of a glass that has ice in it without a straw.  I'm having to fight with keeping the ice cubes out of my mouth.  This might be because I practically have no top lip, but UGH.  I can't understand why they don't have straws!!  On the good side, it really says something about a restaurant when the only thing I can pick on is that they don't have straws...I'll start carrying them in my purse.\n\nI have to say, the view over the East River into Manhattan is breathtaking.  You have to end the night with the walk over to the water.", "author": "Melissa W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-22", "description": "One of my three favorite pizza places and deserving of its reputation.\n\nI rarely go to places that require a long wait--usually make reservations--but made an exception to Grimaldi's to try their famous NYC pizza.  After an hour, I finally got close to the start of the line so that I could place my take-out order.  Some 15 minutes later, I took my Margarita to docks to enjoy with my dining companion.\n\nThe prime pizza had a crisp crust, subtle sauce, and top-notch ingredients.  The toppings were not as generous as Umberto's, but the quality of ingredients and the great sauce made the long wait worth it.\n\nA beautiful clear day, we were able to enjoy the atmosphere (including a wedding or two) along the water overlooking the cityscape of lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge.

The Yankkes, the Mets, the Giants , the Jets and the Rangers to name a few. This pizza does not fall in that catagory however.

I went at 3pm so there was no line and we were actually able to sit a table of fourteen in five minutes! The pizza was very good, one large pizza can be shared by 3 hungry people (remember the crust is thin!) \n\nI also  liked how their sodas are from soda bottles and not fountain soda because then if you do not finish it you can take it with you.\n\nWe ordered half of a pie with mushroom and the other half with a topping but everyone is right the topping just takes away from the pizza.  Don't do it.\n\nOh and it is cash only so leave the plastic at home.", "author": "Diana H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-16", "description": "Definitely worth the wait.\n\nMy cousin came to visit, and we planned an afternoon grabbing a pie at Grimaldi's and then walking over the Brooklyn Bridge.  Only to find a line almost to the end of the block (it was a prime summer afternoon).  If there was anywhere else worthwhile within sight, we probably would have skipped it -- note to potential Brooklyn Heights restauranteurs.  \n\nBut we stuck it out and it was SO WORTH IT.  I was really prepared for this to be one of those NYC tourist experiences that gets really hyped up (guidebooks, the Food Network, that sort of thing) but turns out to be nothing special.  I was very, very wrong.  \n\nI'm sure this is covered below, but beware that they don't serve slices, only full pies.  This is OK, though, as a regular sized pie is the perfect amount to feed two young women.  If you're a big dude, you could probably finish one yourself.  \n\nIt should also be said that Grimaldi's does not serve what I would consider \"New York Style\" pizza.  They're kinda doing their own thing, which I think is great.  But if you went expecting the traditional NYC pizza experience, you might be disappointed.  Also, if you are a tourist, keep this in mind and be prepared to have the traditional slice somewhere else in your trip.\n\nGrimaldi's would be 5 star worthy if they were a carefully kept secret hidden away out in Bay Ridge or something (or better yet, around the corner from my place...), the sort of place you could drop by on a Saturday night.", "author": "Sara C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-22", "description": "It was a good pie but I was turned off by the basil I never asked for.
