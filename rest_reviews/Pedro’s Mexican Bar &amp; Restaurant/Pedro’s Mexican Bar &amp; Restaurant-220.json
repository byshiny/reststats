They have a great location, but other than that nothing is even decent here.\n\nWe thought \"Oh, they serve late -- even if it's not that great, it's rice and beans and tacos...it will still be OK at least. And the drinks will be good.\"\n\nThe food was barely edible. Chewy \"cod\" in the fish tacos that seemed like something else. My friend said the \"chicken\" was also suspect. The black beans seemed canned, but they were at least fine.\n\nThe drinks (of which we each had one only) made us sick into the following day. Or maybe that was the food.\n\nThey also started cleaning the place with what smelled like toxic chemicals while we were still eating. So joy while eating was sort of out of the question.\n\nDon't risk a bad experience or your health by eating here.

Don't mind the long paid for reviews, they are obviously fake.\n\nPlaced order at 7:18pm.  Had to call at 8:45pm.  Only to get a rude hipster who seemed mad that they were working on a Monday night and took it out on the customer.  They decided to play dumb and tell us the order just got \"faxed\" in.  What a joke.  What happened was this person just found the order 1 1/2 hours later and just realized it.  They did not even say they wee sorry , their response was \"oh no this is NOT out fault\".  Not even an apology after that.  It's another reason DUMBO is not a place to go eat.  This place only survives because there is nothing else around.

Pedro's is the grungy little pre-rehearsal dive my band meets at; they serve Mexi-Rican food and I always get the tostones. (And never anything else; I can't expect anything to be vegan, although--psst, Pedro: you could make a killing serving vegan food in DUMBO--just sayin.')

I had a great time! The place is small as heck, so it gets packed to capacity pretty fast. Annie was our waitress she was great! Very personable and attentive. The food was pretty good. Being from Texas, I know good Mexican food, so this place was decent. I'm still searching though. Everybody at the table had something different so we could taste as much as possible. I had the steak fajitas (the steak was tasty!) and I tasted Mexican rice and steak quesadillas. We also had enchiladas which I heard were great and some bowl that my cousin had. All of the food was good, the margaritas were great, and the service was amazing. I had one frozen margarita and everybody else had on the rocks.

Service was prompt and friendly and our beverages and food arrived very quickly. \n\nLet's start with the margaritas: who cares if they are from a mix, they are STRONG. And not like ewww tequila, like total ladykiller. Thank goodness we didn't split a pitcher because I was tipsy off of one. \n\nThe vegetarian options were more interesting than most Mexican restaurants, and we both decided on burritos. They were huge and delicious, every bite seasoned perfectly. \n\nOutdoor seating, strong drinks, prompt service, spicy food, and reasonable prices all add up to a 5 star review in my book.

I guess you get what you pay for. It's another average place. They could really ramp up the quality of the food, charge a little bit more and the place would be booming. Margaritas are strong, but taste like they are from a mix. \n\nFood is decent for the price, just pretty low brow, americanized mexican food. If you're in a bind and want to sit outside, I'd go back. I live a block away. Not rushing to try it again though.

It is what it is: cozy, friendly and unpretentious.\nTwo experiences warrant the five stars: \n\nFirst, on a cold night I noticed a homeless guy at the doorway, the bartender gestured to the man to stay where he was. The bartender then called into the kitchen, a couple of minutes later a dinner in Styrofoam container was delivered to the man at the door. I asked the bartender what the story was? he said he tries to help out the homeless in the neighborhood.\n\nSecond, after a couple of Coronitas, I forgot my credit card at the bar. I called a few days later and the bartender said he had the card and that he was sorry he couldn't catch up with me that night.

I have traveled a lot and eat out quite frequently and have had some pretty good Mexican food and this restaurant isn't it. upon entering we were seated immediately, in the back in a small corner. the waiter didn't come over for probably 30 minutes. a couple sat next to us and he instantly came to them. the restaurant is probably the size of a cubicle so it wasn't like he didn't see us get seated. it took my friend asking the guy for drinks and food. I asked for a water, never got it. and she had to ask 4 times for a margarita. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was probably the worst quesadilla I have ever had. I think Taco Bell might be better. the cheese wasn't even melted all the way and the chicken was super watery. service was terrible, the waiters attitude was terrible \u0026 food was sub par. definitely think there are better restaurants in New York than this place. save your money and don't risk losing your patience like I did.", "author": "Morgan C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-12", "description": "I might be biased because I'm from California, but this isn't Mexican food.

They were both fine and edible. And definitely nothing more. The rice is neon orange and has peas, corn, and carrots in it and actually isn't bad.\n\nPretty overpriced, too, for the quality of food you get. And the service is really nothing to rave about.
