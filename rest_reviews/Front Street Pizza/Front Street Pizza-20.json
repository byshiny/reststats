It was a little too oily but there was a lot of taste. The slices were very big and there were lots of toppings. There were many options and it was a great stop before getting on the Brooklyn Bridge to walk over to manhattan.

It's very close to the Brooklyn Bridge, a place I love to visit.\n\nFront Street has excellent food, their pizza is absolutely amazing.  Coming from CT where there are many great pizza establishments in New a Haven, this place is as good.\n\nThe workers are very friendly, a very clean place, and an enjoyable experience.\n\nI plan to visit Brooklyn when the weather gets a bit warmer, and, you can bet I'll be visiting Front Street Pizza once again.\n\nIf you like pizza and other Italian foods, you have to visit this place, you won't be sorry.", "author": "Tom P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-30", "description": "Consistent and yummy. My fav is their garlic knots. Pizza is decent. I have gotten chicken Caesar spinach wraps also. Although I usually prefer places that make their own caesar. Their fried chicken sandwiches are good. \n\nToday I had their fried fish, mash potatoes with corn. Good. Just wasn't crazy about the mash. Obviously out of a box but it had that school lunch, flavor but still able to eat.", "author": "Natasha E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-16", "description": "Love this spot; good pizza, quick turnaround and space to sit!

Even then, the pizza ain't great. But it's edible so, for that, 2 stars.\n\nToday I wanted to see what else they had to offer. I ordered a turkey sandwich, listed at $6, and the cashier asked me what I would like on the sandwich. I ordered mayo, cheese, lettuce. Somehow, the total came up to almost $9. When I asked why, he said the prices on the menu are literally for JUST turkey on bread. All of the \"sandwiches\" on the \"sandwich\" menu are priced for just meat on bread. I then walked to the other side and got pizza instead.\n\nNot only will I not be paying $9 for a basic turkey sandwich, but I also don't respect an establishment with a deceiving menu. \n\nI hope there's another pizza spot nearby.", "author": "Qori B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-17", "description": "I ordered pizza delivery here for the first time. I ordered a regular cheese pie and asked if they would add rocchetta cheese which they did. Delivery ETA was 40-50 minutes but they delivered in less than a half hour after ordering. The pizza is huge and very tasty. Was very happy with my order.

I loved that you could order pizza by the slice.  There were two other places in Brooklyn that I wanted to try but had over an hour wait even for take out.  I had the Margarita Pizza.

They gave me just enough time to decide, promptly took my order then ushered me through the que like a fun football drill.  \n\nMy slice was topped with sliced sausage, a nice buttery crust, balanced with sauce and cheese.  I'd say a good New York slice prototype.

Me and my friend walked in ready to order and there wasn't a clear place to place our order so we kind of was flustered prior to ordering.

Both were greasy in a boring way. Especially notable was how the Hawaiian lacked toppings. Lots of space to sit inside but very touristy and really not worth it.
