Because the line was almost around the corner of the block.   So decided \"yeah... I just cant wait on this line just for pizza\".\n\nSo I was able to go two weeks ago on a Friday evening.  There was still a line but not as bad and it seems that it is easier to get seating if you are a party of two.\n\nSo we finally got in (after a 20 min wait) and my gawd, do they pack in the people like sardines.  Definly no frills kind of joint and the waiters seemed annoyed at each other for blocking their paths to get to the customers.\n\nSo we order our pizza with Schnapples and it was okay..  The pizza overall seemed soggy but the crust was still crunchy.  I guess it was maybe the extra sauce.  \n\nIt was definitly worth the wait if you want a pizza that you cant get around the corner but compared to totonnes..... I just doesnt beat it.", "author": "Jessica G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-10", "description": "I can't really comment on how this pizza compares to other NYC places. But I can say, as a NY style pizza non-believer, this place made me a convert.  Even with the 1.5 hour wait. Even with the cramped tables.  Even with the botched drink order.\n\nThis pizza was AMAZING. Delicious. Especially the basil leaves on top!  While I don't know I'd do the whole wait thing again, I'm glad I went.

Food . . .\nMy usual standby is a pizza with pepperoni, ricotta and roasted red peppers. It is amazing every time and although I don't live in New York anymore I try to go back to Grimaldi's whenever I can.\n\n. . . Service/Atmosphere . . .\nThe only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because the process of getting the pizza into my stomach takes some work. I usually try to go at off-times because the line can get pretty ridiculous. They do move people quickly though, which is good when you are standing outside but can make you feel rushed when you are the one trying to eat your pizza. The waiters are not particularly friendly, in fact some years ago I went with a group during a slow time and our waiter was quite unpleasant. We had barely had a chance to take our coats off when he came by to get our order. When I said we weren't quite ready he said \"It's easy. Pepperoni or sausage.\" Really, it's not that easy. So we rushed to get our order together and then he took his sweet time coming back to us.\n\nThe pizza is good enough for me to forgive the unpleasant waiters.", "author": "Ramune R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-18", "description": "Wasn't what I expected, but after walking the Brooklyn bridge it was a good pizza for the price!

But last night we had a visitor from out of town and it was getting pretty late, so we thought we'd give it a shot.  We only had to queue up for about ten minutes or so, which is practically nothing, no matter what restaurant you visit -- and we made all that time up inside with the lightning fast arrival of our pizza.\n\nThe crust on that pizza was pretty darn near perfection: the perfection ratio of chew to crisp to char.  I also loved how fresh the cheese and tomato sauce tasted -- even though, in general, the tomato sauce was thinner than I like it.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of the trip, though, was getting to watch them make the pizzas while waiting in line for the restroom!", "author": "Kathleen B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-03", "description": "As a native New Yorker, the amount of time I had to wait for the pizza was not attractive at all.

Great location near the Brooklyn Bridge, easy to get to via subway.\n\nOur wait was only about 20 minutes at lunch time.

The only reason to go to Grimaldi's is if you're in Dumbo anyway and need a quick and reasonably priced dinner.\n\nThe pizza just isn't that great.  (For a famous pizzeria that really *is* that great, try Di Fara in Brooklyn or Pepe's in New Haven.)  It's bland, not always crispy, and not nearly salty enough to be considered New York style.  It's passable, and consistent, but nothing here screams \"good pizza\" except maybe to tourists.  (Which explains why this place is full of them.)  There are dozens of better pizzerias in New York.", "author": "Mike E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-11", "description": "As noted by dozens of other reviewers, Grimaldi's pizza is outstanding. Creating hot, fresh, and mouth watering assortments of brick oven pizza, I have been a loyal customer since 2000. The only caveat is that the line to get in can be long, but the staff keeps it moving and it is definitely worth the wait. If you are visiting New York or just want some delicious pizza then here is my Grimaldi's routine (complete with dessert, sweeping views of Lower Manhattan, and a walk across the iconic Brooklyn Bridge). Come hungry, with a good walking shoes on, and a camera to capture a uniquely New York City experience.\n\n1) Take the A or C train towards Brooklyn and get off at High Street/Brooklyn Bridge stop\n- Exit near intersection of Henry St and Cranberry St\n- Start out going North on Henry St towards Middagh St\n- Turn left onto Old Fulton St towards Grimaldi's\n\n2) Enjoy an outstanding pie at Grimaldi's (waiting in line if necessary)\n\n3) Walk to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory, towards the water, for dessert. They have simple ice cream flavors, excellent hot fudge, and a killer banana split.\n\n4) Enjoy your dessert indoors or overlooking the East River\n\n5) Backtrack towards the Brooklyn Bridge pedestrian entrance, passing Grimaldi's. The entrance is slightly under the bridge and dark so if you are antsy then do this trip around lunchtime.\n\n6) Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge towards the beautiful landscape of Lower Manhattan, where a 4,5,6 \u0026 J,M,Z is at the end. (Bring a jacket because it can get a bit windy in the evening and chilly on the bridge, depending on the time of the year)\n\nI have made this trip numerous times throughout the year and it never fails to impress my friends or myself. It is great to do with friends, a lover, or with your family.

The door swung open with a deliberate forcefulness. A muscular arm shot out from the door beckoning seductively towards the crowd.\n\nThinking about my two week trip to New York, the one image that stands out most in my mind of New York food is the manager of Grimaldi's waving in more eager customers. I never intended for food to be the main drive of my trip to the Big Apple, but if food was my religion, this would be my pilgrimage.\n\nGrimaldi's, redefined pizza for me. Waiting in line in Brooklyn for more than an hour, I thought that Grimaldi's must be overrated. After all, this was the first restaurant I had ever seen awarded an extraordinary Zagat rating. Upon insistence that I try the plain pizza, I ordered one with no toppings. A good pizza dough and great tomato sauce really do make the pizza. But having discovered that, there was no reason why I could not add some sausage and onions to my next pizza that only improved on the original. Grimaldi's is worth the wait, trust me on that.", "author": "Aaron C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-22", "description": "Food Road Trip: New York City, Day 2\n\nFull Disclosure: I love tomato sauce pizza. It's one of my favorite food in the whole world. \n\nGrimaldi's was on Chris K.'s list of places to eat while in New York so we walked from Chinatown across the Brooklyn Bridge to get here. We had heard about the lines so we decided to go in the afternoon. No lines so we were seated right away. The place is pretty small and they pack the tables and chairs so there's not much space. I'm from California so I'm not use to sitting so close to my fellow diners. I wasn't hungry when we sat down, because we had just eaten noodles in Chinatown about 2 hrs before. Only two of us (Chris K. and I) were up for the pizza so we got the small 16 inch pizza. We had half cheese and half pepperoni. \n\nI thought I was only going to eat 1 slice and have to take the rest to go, but we finished it between the two of us. 3 slices per person. I prefer thin crust pizza so this hit the spot. I have never tasted a crust like this one before slightly salty, crunchy and a bit chewy at the same time. The tomato sauce was sweet \u0026 sour and complimented the mozzarella cheese and crust quite nicely.  The first slice was heavenly. The cheese was stringy and pulled from the crust. The cheese pizza was simple but tasted so good. I hope Chris K. will put up a picture of it. I don't think California has a pizza place quite like this which is a shame. I like this style of pizza. My only complaint is that the since it is fresh mozzarella medallions, when the pizza cools down the texture of the cheese is not as smooth.

I think this one takes the cake!\n\nI was there with a party of 6 and there was no line.  I stumbled in close to last order on a Wednesday night after a Barge Music concert right down the block. I guess that was around 10pm? 11pm? I settled in, had a Heineken and ordered pizza with meat.\n\nThe dough was delicious, thin, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. And more importantly, the cheese to sauce ratio was perfect. I prefer saucy pizzas, because the cheese taste is overwhelming. There wasn't any of that here. The cheese was thin and gooey, nothing like the hard chewey cheese you find encasing most pizzas in most places. \n\nI had a grilled cheese sandwich dinner before the concert, but that didn't stop me from scarfing down 3 slices or so of the medium pie.\n\nThe restaurant looks like a dime a dozen Pizzaria with pictures all along the walls. The service was fine and they have the staple beers on hand... nothing fancy. Go there for the pizza and come out a happy (wo)man.  \n\nThey did sort of kick us out past midnight (HAHAHA - understandably so) after they cleaned up.

We tried going here in the summer and the line was down the block. We definitely weren't waiting on that. Last night we happened to be in the city and were planning on going to 99 Miles to Philly but when we got there it was packed. Heading back to Queens, hubby suggest we try Grimaldis. It was late about 9:30pm so I figured it would be worth a shot . We got there at 10:15pm and yahhhh no line. Maybe because it's Halloween weekend or it was cold who knows. Trying to find a parking is stupid but we got lucky because someone from my hubby's fam was out there and happened to know the people that own the place. Hookup! We waited outside for 5 mins. The seating is definitely packed and not my preferred way to eat but I didn't even care. I was so hungry and excited to try this pizza. It came fairly quickly, maybe 15 mins. On arrival it was a beautiful looking pizza. Thin crust, done well not burnt, fresh tomatoes and mozz and a few pieces of basil. My first taste- It wasn't an explosion of flavor like I expected. But it was good. I liked the fresh flavors of the mozz, sauce and hint of basil. The crust was the right texture and just crisp enough. I must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. And yes hubby and I ate the whole pie. And he's not the type to eat more than 1 slice in a sitting. I would definitely come back on an off night when there's a chance of a small line. I don't think I would wait 2 hrs on a line for this though.

Quite the trek, but luckily there was no wait. The pie was solid, but my only complaint was that it was not well done. The perfect pizza, is crispy with some black on the bottom and edges.

Neither was the pizza. \n\nReal good, but if you live in Manhattan there is no reason to trek out there.
