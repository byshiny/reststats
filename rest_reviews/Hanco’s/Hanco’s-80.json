My biggest complaint is that the vermicelli bowls do not come with summer roles, those cost extra. I think around $5 or so. The portion was huge and the food came out fast.

We were starving and really wanted bubble tea after passing by Hanco's on the way to our brunch spot. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this place - I don't know many good places that serve both bubble tea and Vietnamese food together and can do it right.\n\nI decided to get the large Taro bubble tea. When it came out, I thought it was going to be much bigger because it usually is at other places. But I enjoyed it very much and the tapioca balls were good. My girls and I tried the Banh Mi sandwich and to my surprise, it was delicious. It was different from the Classic Banh Mi I'm used to (there's the addition of ground pork, instead of all sliced meat). The sandwich is very short in length but don't that that fool you because the sandwich is wider than usual.  I would say the only downside to this place is that the prices are a bit higher than other spots that I go to.\n\nOverall, I was a fan of Hanco's. The ambiance is chill and our food came out at a reasonable amount of time. If I'm in the area, I will definitely come back to check out more items from the menu.", "author": "Steph Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-29", "description": "The vegetarian options are really great quality here but what made me give this location 2 stars is the bubble tea. I ordered a small vanilla iced latte with bubbles and it was wayyyy to sweet, it tasted as if half the cup was composed of simple syrup. I didn't see any options to change the percentage of sugar so I simply assumed that it would have a little bit of sweetness but that I would be able to actually taste the flavor of my drink but no, it tasted way too similar to drinking straight sweetened condensed milk.", "author": "Khadega S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-17", "description": "I've been to one of the other locations in Brooklyn, a few years ago, but first time here.

I've never been impressed by bahn mi before and this one was particularly stinky, as it had a lot of pickled radishes and my coworker complained that it smelled like trash but it was DELICIOUS so whatever. When it comes to Asian food, the more flavorful and smelly it is, the better!\n\nIn conclusion, the pickled radishes will most definitely stink up your immediate surroundings and possibly make your coworkers judge you, but still totally worth it.", "author": "Aries T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-09", "description": "I ordered regular milk tea and beef pho \nThey give you a good amount of food.

Can't believe that I'm finally writing a review for this place!\n\nLiterally one of my favorite spots for lunch or dinner. It's simple, affordable, tasty and quick. \n\nAs a vegetarian, it's exciting to me that this place offers vegan soy meat substitutes for their food! I nearly always get the noodle soup with the vegan pork. I prefer the pork over the chicken because it's seasoned/ not plain. The girls working here are fast and sweet. The decor is pretty nice and the food is consistently awesome. \n\nWould recommend coming here especially if you're a vegetarian!", "author": "Marsha G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-16", "description": "Great place.

I had purchased the grilled pork sandwich and the taste was perfection.  \n\nThe prices are slightly on the expensive side at $8 with tax.

It is newer and more modern. The sandwiches are always made the way you want it with a lot of options. They have whole or white bread. You can also tell them to limit the amount of dairy (I didn't even know there was butter and mayonnaise on the sandwich is) and then you choose the level of spiciness that you want. The Bahn Mi are definitely the star of the show but they also have really good Bubble tea if you're into that sort of thing. You order and then wait for your food to be called with a number. There are a decent amount of tables but I tend to get my food to go because it's a pretty easy food to eat while you're walking. They also have good summer rolls but I stopped getting those because I find they are quite expensive for not a whole lot of food. I actually feel like the prices here are a little bit more than the park slope location possibly because of higher rent prices -that's my only guess. Either way it has my favorite b\u00e1nh m\u00ec sandwich.", "author": "Marisa L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-01", "description": "We walked by and saw this place on Yelp so we decided to get a quick snack. The wait time was terribly long, we ordered a classic bahn mi and probably waited for like 15 mins.\n\nThe sandwich itself was good, the bread was crunchy and toasted perfectly. I reckon they buttered the bread a lot, cause it was deliciously greasy. The meat was good and the portion is huge.\n\nI'll probably be back next time, but wish they could balance the seamless orders, sit down orders and to-go orders better.", "author": "Tiffany C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-02", "description": "I love bahn mi's! I must have one once a week. I don't work to far from this location. I'm kind of in the middle of this location and the Montague location. So I rotate between the two. The bahn mi I always get in vegetarian chicken with medium spice \"for here\".  It's my fave  aka I never order anything else. \n\nIt's crowded here but this location is close to a bunch of cool coffee shops so dessert or coffee is also covered.

Truth be told, we didn't think banh mi in this area would be as good as it was here.  On this particular day, we need a quick cheap bite before a big family dinner later on the in evening.  So we popped into Hanco's, had a grilled chicken sandwich shared between us and an iced coffee.\n\nFirst impression, the banh mi was packed!  Much meat, so much toppings, such yum.  The flavor was great and consistent with any authentic banh mi place.  The sandwich was hot and crispy in all the right places and the taste was perfect.  We were so glad to tried out this place and kind of sad we missed it in the past at other times we were in the area.
