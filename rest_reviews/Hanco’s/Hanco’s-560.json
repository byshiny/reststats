Very fresh ingredients (great shredded carrots and cucumbers). Very timely delivery, friendly delivery man, and this place is CHEAP. I would highly recommend the classic.

The spring rolls and garden rolls are tasty as well. Everything is extremely affordable. \n\nI just wish they were open later than 9pm.\n\nWait times are by and large pretty fast; however, on occasion, the kitchen can be overloaded with orders and things can take time. It's a small operation, so if you go and notice a long line of folks waiting - be prepared to either wait - or go someplace else.", "author": "a l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-07", "description": "Hanco's has a really terrific tofu bahn mi, and their pork is tasty as well. By default they go a bit heavy on the mayo for my tastes. The sandwiches are well-portioned for a lunch or a light dinner.\n\nI haven't had the bubble tea in a while, but from what I remember I liked it.

I know there is a big rivalry between the two but I don't have a preference for one over the other and Hanco's was the menu I had, so that is what I ordered.  I was blown away.  I ordered the ground pork (heat = spicy) as well as a side salad and an order of summer rolls.  The sandwich was ridiculous.  SO GOOD.  The spiciness of the pork against the sweetness of the pickled carrots were to die for.  The ingredients were so fresh!!  I want one right now just thinking about it.  The salad was equally tasty - again, served with those pickled carrots.  My summer rolls WOULD have been perfection if the mint was included in the roll the way it should have been (as well as how it was advertised) but maybe they were out of mint that day... whatevs... they were still awesome.  Oh, and this place is a BARGAIN.", "author": "Krista C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-07", "description": "I had this 3 days in a row! I can't believe how good their sandwiches are. I've tried Paris in chinatown which is pretty darn good but this place takes the cake. The meat is plentiful (for a Vietnamese sandwich) and the flavors are done well. I tried their Pork, Classic and faux Pork. I could easily see myself converting to a weekday vegetarian with these guys. They are pretty fast but not fast food fast especially during a rush of people.. I've waited on line longer at a Starbucks though.", "author": "Tony N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-29", "description": "This little sandwich shop makes an amazing banh mi.", "author": "Will D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-21", "description": "Best Vietnamese Sandwich I've ever had.

Sometimes though, I feel like they shove too much veg in there and I always seem to get a mouthful of cilantro stems rather than the good stuff. All in all, I really like it and they're shredded chicken is great too if you're in the mood for something different. The bread is amazing, can't complain about that!

We orded the Classic and Grilled Pork chop sandwiches; now, this is what Banh Mi should taste like, oh how I wish they'd set up shop midtown.  The little take-out shop consists of nothing more than your typical main counter and several lowly tables and chairs; order, wait, grab your sandwich, bite in and enjoy, let those taste buds relish in the flavors of one of Indochina's greatest exports to The New World!

If you haven't been here, do yourself a favor and try it out!  My favorite is the mango bubble tea. It's refreshing and the tapioca is fun to chew.
