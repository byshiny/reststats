It's fast food but it's actually really good. My staple is the Milanesa de pollo.. breaded chicken sandwich. So yummy... But then you gotta put the green sauce on and it's a party in your mouth!!!  Add some platanos and you got a full meal.\n\nI really find myself in trouble once a week b/c I can't walk by w/o getting something.

Both are quite dry and sometimes I question their authenticity. Am I eating juicy, fatty pork or am I eating slices of dried tree bark foraged from the great Redwood Forest? Their overly saucy Ground Beef Stew needs no description and as for sandwiches I can only vouch for the mediocrity of the Cuban Sandwich that lacked much flavor and could be compared to a pair of old Dominos pizza crusts with a few slices of meat in between. Sides are less memorable than the mains.\n\nThe lack of care given to the cooking gives popularity to Sophie's Green Sauce which has to be added to every bite much like curry has to be added to poor quality meats or lime has to chase a cheap shot of rubbing alcohol tequila. \n\nPlus 1 star for large portions and consistency. \n\nYou may ask: Why do You keep ordering? Well...if food in Dumbo wasn't so terrible or could at least do better than -3 stars, there would not be a need to order anymore. And besides, some of us require balance in our lives. Like an undesirably grueling workout may have to follow a night of heavy drinking, a meal at Sophies may have to follow a night at Per Se.", "author": "Davis K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-30", "description": "Solid downtown BK Sophie's with your standard fare from the chain.", "author": "George C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-19", "description": "This is for the baked chicken with white rice.

I have never been to the restaraunt but I always order online. First off the food is really really good best Spanish food I have ever tasted. They give you 2 sides which is amazing cause most places only let you choose 1. I always get the shredded beef stew with yellow rice and salad and it comes out perfect. The meal is excellent I love that when I make a order it comes so fast like less than 30 mins.

The food was good, but I doubt that I'll be visiting this place again anytime soon. The customer service sucked. \n\nI ordered my food to go, but seeing how it was hot out I decided to eat in the restaurant. ALL 15 or so tables were EMPTY, so I grabbed a small 2 seater table. The manager promptly came over and said that since I ordered my food to go I wasn't allowed to sit at any of the tables. He said that I could sit in the back of the restaurant by the kitchen at this barstool area.\n\nI don't think it would've bothered so much if I wasn't LITERALLY the ONLY customer at the time. It wasn't like I hadn't just spent my money there. It wasn't like I was using up much needed table space. I don't know... just rubbed me the wrong way.", "author": "Tavaria R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-23", "description": "Let's face it. No matter how many times I say I'm going to start cooking more at home, I realize that it takes way too much work and way too much time and I mean, if I buy groceries and end up wasting them anyway... then I mean, what's the point?\n\nAnywho, Sophie's is sometimes my go to spot for a filling dinner when I'm in the mood for one (which is always). I've only ever had the shrimp in garlic sauce which is by far my favorite (and probably something I could cook at home... I digress). Now, caveat, I've only ordered delivery but delivery is always super fast, and the food is super hot. And, I don't know about you but for $12, I can get AT LEAST 2 meals out of all the food.
