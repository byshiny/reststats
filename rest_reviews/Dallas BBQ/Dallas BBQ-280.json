It's over crowded and extremely loud in this establishment. From the moment I sat down my neighbors sitting next to me were yelling to communicate to one another. My guest and I could not concentrate on a conversation. My server was great. He offered every special on the menu and was prompt with taking my order. I chose Baby Back Ribs and Chicken (dark meat) and a very tiny salad as my side . The ranch dressing served in a  large bowl and my salad went swimming inside of it.  \nWhen I received my meal I thought I was missing a piece of chicken , it was so small I thought I ordered a chicken wing . Also the chicken was not cleaned well because it still had the blood clot in it .The chicken lacked all flavor. The ribs were cooked 5 times over I thought I was chewing rubber . My dog has strong teeth and couldn't rip the meat off. The sauce was so sweet, I could not finish any of my meal. \nMy friend never finished his honey basted rotisserie chicken double dipped in batter and over fried . I was done at that point and couldn't wait to pay my $39.63 meal ( tip included) . I would have added more tip money if only  I enjoyed this meal and restaurant . For years Dallas BBQ has been my favorite spot to go to in NYC , but not the Brooklyn location. I will never return here again. I'll stick to what I know best and go to my favorite location on 23 rd St in Chelsea area in the city . I only chose this location because it was in my immediate area. My recommendation is go here if you like but have an open mind .", "author": "Michael S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-01", "description": "Great food!

I've been to like almost all of the locations in NYC. I go to this one sometimes when I don't want to get on the train but my fav one is the one on 23 St and 8th Ave...they have the best service. You can't go wrong with the sticky wings or fried wings with ranch on the side. I used to always get the honey basted rotisseried chicken but somehow over the years I can't eat it anymore. The chicken isn't cooked well enough for me and it makes me nauseous. So I stick with the ribs, shrimp, and wings. I LOVE their pi\u00f1a coladas!!! They are theee best...and very strong with the alcohol added. Bbqs is the go to place for consistent cheap food and drinks.

As she is eating she notice a bug in her salad. She told the waiter and he asked if she wanted another one. Needless to say, she requested for the manage. He was a totally ASS HOLE AND NONE CARING ABOUT THE SITUATION. He had the nerve to say it looked like lettuce. By far the most disgusting thing I've ever encountered in my life. BBQ WAS A FAVORITE SPOT FOR ME, TONIGHT WAS AND IS MY LAST VISIT TO ANY BRANCH. I will also be filling a complaint with the health department. Not to mention, we still had to pay for our food.

We had small chicken leg with thigh and a poor grade of chicken. a bake potato which was not done, cornbread had no taste to it. We are from long Island. I will never return here again.

I came with a party of 4 Saturday night and was seated in 5 minutes (great). The waiter came introduced himself and said he would be back. He came back 10 minutes later and we told him we were ready to order. We placed our order and waited for 45 minutes. I couldn't believe as the table behind us which was a party of 4 and the table next to us which was a party of 5 were both seated after us and had their food orders before we did. Finally when I tracked the waiter down and asked him about our food order he looked at me with a blank stare and see I will go check for you. He didn't even bother to come back to update us on the status. We asked for a manager and explained what we ordered and how 2 other parties after us were already served their food (no apology from the manager ether). Our waiter then comes back and said it will be 2-3 minutes. By that time the table next to us (party of 5) was receiving their second serving of wings, drinks, and appetizers, etc. Finally the food and arrived and womp, womp, womp, it's cold. My mom's food was cold and my chicken was extremely dry. They took it back and added some sauce to it but the food was not reheated or a new dish was cooked for us. The waiter never apologized nor did he give an explanation to the long wait. I get that it's a Saturday and its packed but when everyone else around me has food then I am pissed. As we were eating the waiter literally stood by our table but still didn't ask us if we were okay, if we needed drinks or anything else. Finally, the bill comes We were charged $96 including 15% gratuity. I immediately called the manager over and reminded him of our experience and told him that we were not going to compensate our waiter for his lack of service. He immediately took the gratuity off and we did not tip the waiter. The waiter must have told his fellow co-workers because as we were leave a waitress rolled her eyes and mumbled bitch to me under her breath. I don't care what you call me. When I come to a restaurant I automatically have in my mind that I am tipping 20% if the service is not so great I start deducting from that percentage and his service sucked and I waited 45 minutes for cold food and not even a refill on my drink so he got nothing and deserved nothing.", "author": "Ebony J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-28", "description": "I don't know how many times I've been but obviously I'd rate myself as a fan of this franchise. A friend and I went to grab a late lunch on Memorial Day and it was deserted. I was expecting a full house for some reason since their cuisine is predominantly bbq but I guess everyone decided to make it themselves. The waitress was pretty nice. She quickly took our drink order and returned for our meal selections. On such a slow day, the three of us could not figure out why the kitchen was so backed up on chicken tenders. While I waited, we decided to share an order of fries. My friend bet that the fries would come out with the tenders though it was requested much later. Would you believe she guessed right? Anywho, the meal was delicious as always. Just enough portions to leave with full bellies. I tried out their new drink the Miami Vice (pina colada and non-alcoholic strawberry daiquiri). It didn't blend well in my opinion, but you're welcome to try it yourself. Only downside really is the restroom facilities. The stalls are way too tiny and mothers are left without a changing table so be sure to make the necessary preparations before heading over here.
