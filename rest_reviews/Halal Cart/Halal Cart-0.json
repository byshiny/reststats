It's easy to be patient when you can expect high quality product. The men in charge are amiable and always remember a face. The  \"Take care, habibi\" when you leave adds a little something extra.\n\nThe chicken and lamb are spiced perfectly and not too greasy. The \"cartilage factor\" for the chicken is triumphantly low. Rice comes in two varieties (standard): Yellow and Spicy. They are both fresh, hot and have a lively texture. The spicy is not too spicy so DO NOT BE AFRAID. The salad is also fresh, and tomatoes and onions are included. The sauces: perfect white sauce. The hot sauce is more about the flavor than the heat. BBQ sauce is standard. Portions are hefty and plates go for $5. \n\nThis cart's consistency is its real selling point. You know you will get quality each and every time that ominous halal craving takes hold.", "author": "Ben L."}], "servesCuisine": "Food Stands", "priceRange": null, "name": "Halal Cart", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "Court St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": null, "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": ""}
