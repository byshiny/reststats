Pizzas are unbelievable but the eggplant parm is Hall of Fame material. I'd put it up against any place in NYC.

I've gotten into a horrible/amazing habit of going here after my long runs and just devouring one of their delectable pizza creations within 10 minutes. Oops.\n\nJust check out their menu and you will see that they have a pizza for everyone with an assortment of red pies as well as an impressive assortment of white pies. I always get the Arrabbiata pizza which comes with mozzarella, hot soppressata, fresh basil and spicy extra virgin olive oil. It's got a small kick which really just warms you up all over and tingles your lips. It really hits the spot.\n\nThey also have some great appetizers (hello juicy meatballs!) and Brooklyn Brewery beers on tap plus a good assortment of wine. It's supposed to be a pizzeria and wine bar. Great hybrid. The space is also pretty casual nice (they combined two shops so there's ample space for groups of any size) and it is kid friendly. Management is great.\n\nDellarocco's is definitely my new favorite pizza spot and a wonderful addition to the Brooklyn Heights hood!

We had a white pizza (i.e. no tomato sauce) and it was super good! The bread and crust was perfect and the toppings fresh and taste. Even the arugula (or rucola, as I'm used to call it in Europe) was crispy and tasty.\n\nStaff seated us immediately (no reservation), were very attentive and delivered the food immediately.

I will eat pretty much any pizza, even frozen pizza is edible in my book.\nHow unbelievably happy I was to discover Dellarocco's and it's a block away from my apartment. I ordered delivery ffrom them a couple of times and was like \"wow, this is good pizza\". Last week, I finally went with my daughter to celebrate an occasion and ate at the restaurant. It is a comfortable space, with very attentive servers. We ordered the Tartufo pizza which has mozzarella, Gorgonzola, shiitake mushrooms and truffle cream. We were both in heaven and vowed it was the only pizza we would ever eat again. The other notable menu item is the eggplant parm...it;s like no other -- truly the best I have ever eaten. We took what was left over, which was not much, and ate it cold the next day. It was that good.", "author": "chris g."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-01", "description": "Located in Brooklyn Heights, Dellarocco's is a small pizza shop with a varied menu.  In addition to a small selection of appetizers and salads, it offers red and white pizzas, as well as calzones.  My group ordered two salads and a porcini mushroom pizza.  The salads arrived quickly and were delicious.  Our pizza was light and tasty with fresh ingredients.  We ended our meal by splitting an order of cannoli. \n\nWe arrived early on a Sunday, among the first customers.  However, by the time we left, the restaurant was nearly full.

Lemon sponge cake and tiramisu! YUM! Could eat all day, and wish the portions were even bigger\n 6) Won't break the bank! Which is why I love brooklyn places like this (they don't succumb to the ever-increasing popularity to drive their prices up)...5 pizzas, 2 desserts, couple of drinks split among 5 people came to $25ish/person which includes 20% tip. \n7) Citi Bike rack is right next to it\n\nCons:\n1) Not all the pizza's are knockouts (i.e. arrabiatta...just tastes like a pepperoni)...some are kinda what you can find anywhere else", "author": "Sumito A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-30", "description": "Having just completed a lovely pizza tour of the neighborhood, I can say with certainty that this pizza is amazing.

My favorite was the veggie pizza but the classic cheese was great, as well. I also enjoyed the Nutella dessert pizza at the end!\n\nThe service was wonderful, as was the food.

The arugla salad was delicious.  Had the pizza with clams.  There was maybe one clam that had been cut up and sprinkled over the whole pie.

When did a slop of marinara = cherry tomato sauce?\n\nI ordered a \"Siciliana\", listed clearly on the menu under \"Red Pizzas\" as \"Cherry Tomato Sauce with Eggplant, Smoked Mozzarella, Shaved Parmigiano\".  I asked for no mozzarella, due to lactose issues.\n\nPizza arrives with chunks of cooked eggplant and shaved parmigiano.  Um, cherry tomato sauce?  So I flag the waiter and ask whether it was supposed to have tomato sauce?  He goes away, I see much fluttering in the kitchen and he returns with the same pizza with a spread - no, a SLOP - of marinara sauce spooned over the top.  At least half a cup's worth.  He asks if it's OK that they just added marinara on top.  What??!!?? I was speechless.  And truthfully, STARVING.  So although I probably should have sent it back, I just took it.  \n\nBut really?  Why would you DO that?  I can't believe they would completely ruin a beautiful pizza they just cooked that way.  So much for the crust.  And so much for my belief in the professionalism of the kitchen here.  So sad.\n\nTwo stars for the lovely arugula salad and the four glasses of wine.

We got the gluten free White Pesto pizza to share. The portions were tiny but full of flavor; we debated getting another pie but opted to share dessert instead. Dessert was meh so I wasn't too thrilled w/ it.\n\nDellarocco's interior design is really airy and spacious with generous gaps between tables to move around. We we seated near the ovens so it was very warm during our meal- an overhead fan might be a good idea to install near the kitchen. Bathrooms were clean and sufficient.\n\nPizza was really delicious but super $$$ for the size. Brooklyn really has gone the way of the 1%.

I started off with the spinach and goat cheese salad. My bf ordered the meatballs. Both were amazing and were much bigger than we were picturing because we weren't very hungry for our pizza.
