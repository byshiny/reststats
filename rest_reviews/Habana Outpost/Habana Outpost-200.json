I wish they topped it with red and green sauce like many other Mexican restaurants. Aside from that excellent option and affordable prices. The draft beers are $3.50 all day everyday and Burritos around $8.50. \n\nThey have outdoor seating. The lines get long here. I highly recommend visiting on a weeknight or early during a weekend. They have the best Corn on the Cob I've ever had during my entire existence!! Seriously AMAZING!!! Please go try it. Great place for a quick meal and cheap drinks. I can't wait to return.", "author": "Yanill P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-27", "description": "I went on a thrusday night at is wasnt packed! Laid back vibe kinda place. Drinks are strong, cheap and good.. I got the catfish burrito and wasn't impressed because it was not seasoned. Very bland. However GET THE CORN!

That said, the customer service at Habana To Go was so awesome tonight that I could resist. I go to Habana Outpost often for margaritas and chips during their open season. I love their fish tacos - not greasy, lots of flavor, delicious! So, when I was down the street this evening getting my hair done I figured I'd walk down the block while my color set to grab some tacos. \n\nFirst, the young woman at the counter was DELIGHTFUL. She was patient and kind, giving me time and guiding me when I couldn't make up my mind to save my life. She must have seen the disappointment on my face when I inquired about the veggie taco. I said, so what veggies go into that one? She said well, it's guacamole, lettuce and tomato. Again, she must have seen my \"oh that's it?\" face. Without skipping a beat, she said, we actually have a vegetable mix today that is saut\u00e9ed, why don't I have them throw that together for you? And let me tell y'all, it was DELICIOUS. So, here I am, hair setting and my salon calls to tell me that I need to come back - I've clearly taken forever to make a decision. (Concerned that my hair would snap into pieces) I went to the counter to inquire about my order. \n\nThe manager has since come behind the counter and heard my cries for help. She insisted that I go and she deliver the tacos to the salon down the block. Seriously? Amazing. Note: it was really really cold tonight and she volunteered to go outside. Not only did she bring the tacos straight to my salon chair, but she brought me a free water bottle. \n\nHabana staff, you made my night! Thanks for being so kind. It's the little things that keep the world smiling.", "author": "Becca K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-04", "description": "This is my new Sunday spot ..

You can chill and people watch to your hearts content. Also great for groups. \n\nHowever, I have to say I feel like this place is coasting on its past glory, if it was ever considered glorious, when it comes to the actual food and drink. \n\nGuacamole - meh\nMargarita - meh (especially for what tastes like a Walmart frozen mix)\nTacos - meh to decent, depending on what you order. I'm partial to the shrimp tacos. \nCorn - don't bother\n\nI usually come here because someone else has invited me to a group outing - like a birthday.

The atmosphere is fun, lively and great DJs. I usually come here for the Cuban sandwichs. I feel that the flavor is still there but the passion in making them fell off. The ham was cold, the bread was barely pressed the way it should be. The beverage waitress inside ruined my visit. She was very rude and nasty. Her attitude was extremely uncalled for. I went to get drunk twice and the second time was as bad as the first. She made me feel very unwelcomed.

The atmosphere is cool. It's a nice place to relax with a group of friends. I had the chicken sandwich, sweet plantains and Sangria. My bf had the guac and queso plato, Mexican corn, and spiked lemonade. Everything was tasty. I loved my sangria but the spike lemonade needed some extra spiking so I paid an extra $5 for a shot of vodka in it. For all that the bill was about $45-50 which is pretty reasonable for 2 people. \n\nMy only problem was with the security patrolling the place. It was my first time so I'm not sure if anything happens in here but he was walking around the restaurant like a bouncer in a club. Made me a little uneasy because I wasn't sure if I needed to be on the look out like he was... \nEither way, I'll be back.", "author": "Jenya W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-06-04", "description": "Newly moved from Manhattan...

Napkins and menus were blowing all over the place while we sat outside one early Fall afternoon. \n\nSecond kids seem to like it. For whatever reason: the bright colors; the neglected water fountain; the self service or the freedom to run around in Habana's vast angular space, the other kids had the same lit-up-like-a-Christmas-tree look on their faces as my toddler. So no matter how much I was itching to get out of there, i tolerated it because he was having a good, simple, no pressure time. \n\nThird, the system is a bit of a pain the arse, and kids love to see their parents annoyed. If you take the side entrance, you'll have to walk inside to grab a menu, go back to your table to figure out what you want, go back inside to order and pay, then back outside to wait for your order. It's kinda like being at your single cousin's house for a 3 p.m. bbq that really starts at 5, only you have to pay. \n\n$19 and change for chicken fingers, fries and a chicken sandwich seemed steep to me.
