There is a young woman who works the register who rushes you and ignores any special request on your order- I mean literally pretends she doesn't hear you - other than her I think this is cool late nightspot to grab some quick grub", "author": "Mr. T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-02-05", "description": "WING STOP BROOKLYN STOP IT!!!! HORRIBLE they lost so many orders tonight, it was crazy.  There was a lady there behind the counter with no uniform (maybe the owner) and her long hair flowing without a hat.  I tried to call my order in and as usual they DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE! I came in ordered 55 wings and it took an HOUR! WOW! WING STOP WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES, AS A TEXAN, I WAS SO HAPPY TO KNOW THEY WERE COMING TO BROOKLYN...... MAN I WILL DO LIKE I HAVE BEEN DOING AND WAIT TILL I GO HOME! ewwww! service sad and the lack of training shows.
