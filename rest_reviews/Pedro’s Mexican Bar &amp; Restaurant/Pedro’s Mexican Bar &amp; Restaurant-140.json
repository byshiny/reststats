The tables are quite smushed together, which makes it cozy, but with the loud music in the background, you're basically eating in a sound chamber.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best.  Nothing of spice, nothing of flavor.  Points for having a tofu burrito, but not so good if you don't prepare it.\n\nFrom other yelp reviews, it seems this place is a tourist trap.  Totally makes sense - it's quite visible from the touristy walk-throughs.  Search yelp a little more and be adventurous.  But hey, this place does have a bar...maybe that's all you need?", "author": "Christopher C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-13", "description": "Geez, I'm so surprised at the many horrible reviews. I had a great experience at Pedro's. The guava and cheese empanadas are soooooo good. I'm obsessed with the fact that I can get a corona in my rita, that made me most happy. I also has a chicken burrito which was very filling. \n\nYes, the place is a bit cozy and probably uncomfortable if you're over 6ft, but I would come back.

It's tucked away in a nice corner. The food is amazing, I've had the steak burritos and it's to die for. \n\nI also recommend the pomegranate margarita. Delicious and well balanced. \n\nThe staff is really friendly and up beat. The only downside is the wait especially in the evening. This place can get packed and for good reason. There's more room in the warmer seasons as they have outdoor seating. \n\nDefinitely a place I'd return to when I'm craving Mexican food.", "author": "Denisse P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-11", "description": "This quaint Mexican is a mainstay of revelry when we are in Dumbo. The service is quick and pretty standard fare offerings except for that crazy drink with the beer sunken in.  \n\nWhile I'm no expert I would say I've had better and I've had worst so Pedro's when you want a nice fish taco and drown it down with a classic Margarita.", "author": "David N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-08", "description": "OVERRATED OVERRATED OVERRATED did I say OVERRATED? First of all I want to make it clear that this has nothing to do with the staff. They were attentive and courteous. This goes to the quality of food and drinks . I really wanted to try a lively place where I can enjoy sitting outside sipping on some awesome margaritas during the summer. Just moved to Brooklyn from the city, so I was excited to try this place. It all went downhill very quickly .... first of all they gave us cheap plastic cups . We started with the chips and guacamole and chips were stale and guacamole was very bland. My husband ordered chicken quesadillas... no taste . I ordered tamales and they were just ok. I was hoping the drinks were going to win me over , but I was soooo wrong. I ordered the coconut margarita and all I could taste was the heavy pour of cheap tequila with some sour and a hint of coconut... terrible!! My husband's margarita was a mix of tequila and sour. I seriously think this place is busy because there is really nothing else like this around the Dumbo area. So disappointed.", "author": "Heidi C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-06-12", "description": "Clearly whoever owns this place has one plan - to declare war on Mexico. I challenge you to find worse Mexican food in New York. Even better: the place is a total rip off. $9 for chips, salsa and guacamole. Salsa tasted like hot sauce, chips were inexplicably fluorescent green and the guacamole tasted like it was from a powder mix. The prices are ridiculous and for your pains you get your water in Dixie cups and a ripped paper towel for a napkin. The prices are seemingly pulled out of thin air by a 5-year-old. I'm pretty sure the owner went through a very bad breakup with someone who is actually Mexican and now wants to offend every Mexican in New York. Bring an antibiotic to go with your food. You might need it. Can't believe the people of Dumbo haven't forcibly shut this place down.", "author": "Julie W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "Not really sure why they have 2.5 stars.

My girl had tacos and really liked their pork.\n\nThe margaritas were ok. I can't really complain nor can I really suggest  you go out of your way to have one.\n\nSadly this is a 3 star.

Pedro's sidewalk tables welcomed us in , as did the smiling , dapper Dillinger , our waiter.  At that hour, we opted for drinks and apps.  Dos Equis ambers are usually hard to find in most establishments, Mexican or otherwise.  No problem at Pedro's.  They had plenty of cold ones there.  My cousin had the Bulldog... the margarita with a beer bottle in it! Remember to swish it around and mix it up, otherwise you'll get trashed on the margarita before the beer drops! The sample platter with the chicken soft tacos,  beef chimichangas and pork flautas were delicious. So was the Mexican corn. The mixed empanadas were wonderful too.  This was my 2nd time there.  Service was great both times. So if you're Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overoass and want a nice place away from the crowd at the pier, remember Pedro's for great drinks and food!", "author": "Eddie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-09", "description": "Have worked in the area for a few months, but just went in for the lunch special for the first time today.\n\nAt lunchtime, $6 gets you a huge container of rice, beans, and your choice of meat.
