Once while it was super packed on a Cinco de Mayo in 2015 and another on a random September 2017 Wednesday when it was quiet. Good service and the food is amazing. Mexican style steak for the win y'all. For real! You know what I think? I think... What I think is this... I think that you should give this place a chance, and your money by extension.

Ducked in here to get out of the rain and wind before a show at St. Anne's. Low key, dimly lit Mexican dive with simple Mexican food and tasty margaritas. Tamales and enchiladas were particularly yummy. Rose, our waitress and possibly the owner, was friendly and helpful. Love Pedro's!

Probably not unless I just want a drink. Will I go back if a group of friends invite me to meet them there, sure why not.\nThe place is decorated in a divey mexican joint sort of way.\nI ordered the steak taco bowl. The steak wasn't the best quality steak but it was edible. I wish there were more greens in the bowl.\nI ordered the skinny margarita and it was perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness for me. It wasn't cheap but I would probably get that again. \nThe service was decent.\nCould they do better? Yes, but they also could do much worse.", "author": "Leala V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-05", "description": "The only reason why I gave one star is because the prices are decent. But from the time I get there until the time I left the service was absolutely terrible ! Staff was so unorganized, wait time was ridiculous . Staff couldn't even keep up with the wait list ... i repeatedly had to track the waiter down to remind her of my order . My appetizer came out the same  time as my entree , the margarita had absolutely no alcohol in it , and most importantly my chicken had a bad smell , as if it was not properly cleaned .

Been to Pedro's once. Once in 17, almost 18 years. And i LOVE Mexican food. \n\nIt's painfully obvious this place isn't doing a very good job, based on all of the 1 \u0026 2 star reviews.

I had the fish tacos and a beer and she had the spinach Quesada and a glass of wine that wasn't as bad as I anticipated. Both dishes were good. The portions weren't huge which was fine for us as we weren't looking for a filling meal. The service was HORRENDOUS. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks. Not being  familiar with Dumbo, we decided to wait it out. I even went in to get the drinks at one point and was told that they would be brought out. The drinks had not been set up by the bartender so it's unclear if the server put them in. The restaurant was busy and understaffed. The inefficiencies in service were numerous and glaring.", "author": "Cynthia K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-22", "description": "Keep your expectations low. Was here for a Monday lunch.\n\n1. Very sub-par waitstaff -- waitress made eye contact with me three times and continued to walk by me repeatedly. I had to proactively stop her to eventually get my order in. 15 minutes later I was told they -- during prime lunch hour with a half-empty venue -- were out of chicken and it would be at least an hour. Weirdly, despite the table next to me having ordered well before me, I noticed she didn't tell them about the chicken for another 10 minutes while they waited for their food. The place wasn't even busy, and yet she still appeared stretched way too thin. Perhaps it was her first day, but not a great experience.  Over 20 minutes, I watched almost every table have to nag her more than once for their requests.\n\n2. Don't expect much from the food either. Burrito was bare bones, 90% rice \u0026 beans, 10% meat.\n\nI'd say this can all be offset by cheap prices, but it's not even cheap. I'd imagine this place is more fun for drinks on the weekend, but if you are looking for a legit meal, perhaps go elsewhere.", "author": "David L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-13", "description": "Small place. Bad micheladas. Smallest guacamole I've ever had. I told the waitress the guacamole was so small and she said \"that's the restaurant standard\".

However, I recently came back because I was in the neighborhood, and I wanted to get my margarita and burrito fix. My fianc\u00e9 and I were seated immediately, but the wait was longer than usual. As we finally got our order in, we asked to sit at the bar, because the sun was in our eyes. Sitting at the bar was a better idea, because we got more customer service, since the bartender was always present. \n\nI ordered their chicken burrito, and somehow it tasted different than when I came here a year ago. The portions were smaller and the prices went up.
