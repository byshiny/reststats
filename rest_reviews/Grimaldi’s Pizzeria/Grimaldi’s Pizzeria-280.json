No sauce, no flavor, poor service, plastic cutlery, added gratuity, hour wait. Definitely did not live up to the hype. After eating here I felt hustled. This place sucks. Save your money and your dignity, go eat better pizza elsewhere and be treated like a human being. Try Prince street pizza instead..... 10x better!!!!", "author": "Thomas B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-01-06", "description": "Yes there was a line but it was so worth the wait !!!

We decided to make our way across the Brooklyn bridge and we're hungry for something good. We were originally going to check out Juliana's, but the wait was ridiculous. We walked right into Grimaldi's and we're seated immediately. The pizza here is so delicious! From the crust, to the cheese, just sheer perfection. The service was also great too. It is is cash only but I think saw an atm in the restaurant.", "author": "Michelle F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-27", "description": "Wait : 1.5 hours for Tuesday night at 6:30 pm. It's better to go with a big group coz the waiting time will be significantly shorter \nCash only!!!! They have ATM inside \nService : So so, you have to grab them otherwise, they will ignore you \nFood : delicious pizza, crispy side. I love the tomato. Black olive is a little salty side \nOverall : should try for an experience but won't come back again. It's not worth the wait.", "author": "Yu H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-02", "description": "I'm not a pizza person but I loved their pizza and the cannoli was huge!

Was assuming there would be a long line after readings reviews but for some reason there was none. We were seated quickly and it was moderately busy.\n\nPizza:\nOrdered a LARGE : about 8 slices (shared between 3 people)\ntoppings: pepperoni and mushrooms\n\nPizza came out within 10mins (pretty quick). Presentation was very scrumptious. Lots of pepperoni and mushrooms on the pizza. Notice there was a couple basil leaves on the pizza. Crust was perfect.  \n\nQuality was very good. The melted mozzarella(high quality) cheese was perfect. Each bite had pepperoni and mushroom. My pet-peeve was I had to fold the pizza up since the toppings and cheese would slide off and the dough was kind soggy under the sauce/ cheese/ toppings. I think if left in a few more minutes it would have been perfect. \n\nLarge pizza was perfect for 3 people got about 2 big slices each and had to take the other 2 home.\n\nService:\nFriendly. Quick. Good.\n\nOverall:\nWould like to give 5 stars but cash only and kinda soggy under the sauce/ cheese/ topping hard to eat with hands. Other than that still a good pie.", "author": "Samuel D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-20", "description": "It has been about 8 years since I went to Grimaldi's and it is still delicious. \n\nWe got a sausage and mushroom pizza and it did not disappoint. \n\nMy wife and I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and as a treat we treated ourselves to some amazing pizza. \n\nCooked to perfection in the OG brick coal oven.", "author": "Brian A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-18", "description": "Great pizza fast and typical New York.  \n\nTook a bunch of us here for a quick dinner after shooting the cityscape.

Pizza itself was delicious, I got the anchovies, pepperoni, onion and chicken as toppings on 2 separate pies. Unless you really like seafood and you like your food to be really salty, I would not recommend the anchovies - it was a too salty. Other than that, the other pizza toppings tasted really good.   \n\n\nAlso they have outlets to charge your phone for those who find yourself with phones that are low in battery.", "author": "Andy Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-27", "description": "Awesome pizza!

Price is about standard, but it's very touristy so I would recommend buying a pie for take out and sit by the water, plus you don't have to tip if you take out.

Decided to give this COAL FIRED PIZZA a try. This place uses: great quality ingredients, cooks perfectly, taste awesome, and it's fresh out the brick coal oven to your table. The pizza is a thin crust but made awesome. I gave this place four stars just short of 5 stars because the plastic forks and knives don't cut through the pizza and the tables and chairs are wobbling.

I should have gone to Ignacio's around the corner. \n\nI do have to say that the pizza is dam good and the staff is nice they just don't get it though.

Placed a phone order for sausage and mushroom. Late Pizza was $23. Super affordable. And it was ready within 10 minutes. But compared to Lombardi's the taste of Lombardi's is just better to me. Grimaldi's is good and for price; definite value. I do love how their crust is thin, flaky, and airy. Nice crunch when you bite down on it. Ingredients are fresh too.
