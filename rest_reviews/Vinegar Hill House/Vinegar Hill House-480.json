The restaurant, which makes full use of its limited space, does not throw you onto someone's table or push you up against the bar as soon as you enter.  Instead a single aisle divides the front of the space which is the main dining area.  Turns out, this place is aptly named, as it feels much more like a house than your run of the mill Brooklyn restaurant.  Seating at the tables might be tight, but you are not lost in a massive crowd so much as one part of the team that is your corner of the restaurant.  I dig camaraderie and it seems you can find it here. There's something about destination restaurants that bring out the best in people.  Once you get there you're already in with the in crowd.  It's a good feeling.\n\nThe menu is filled with seasonal options that fall into an expected price range.  Dinner and drinks for two might be around a hundred bucks.  They also have cocktails and, I must point out, are one of only two places I know that serve applejack in Brooklyn.  Applejack is a liquor made from apples.  It's great to drink in spring and the main ingredient in a Jack Rose, a cocktail very similar to one listed on their menu.\n\nWith my date I ordered about six things and all were fresh and well conceived.  I wasn't into the preparation of the scallops but the dish did have ramps, which are my favorite seasonal anything.  I wanted more ramps, but... I always want more ramps.\n\nI will go back here again for the atmosphere, the abundance of quality ingredients, and staff's desire to let me sit back and enjoy a dinner in their house.", "author": "Jack S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-24", "description": "Ohhhh baby...totally worth the hour wait.", "author": "Brian L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-12", "description": "Wait time + Service: On a Saturday night, we waited 25 minutes for a table for 2. There was a bit of waiting for the server to take our order and then a bit more waiting to get a glass of wine, but it was a busy night at VHH as usual and we weren't in such a huge hurry.\n\nFood: For starters, we got the Chicken Liver Mousse with vinegar onions and pistachios. In addition, there was a small handful of fresh greens drizzled with horseradish sauce, and there were three 1-inch thick chunks of toast. The crust of the toast was on the slightly burnt and inedible side. The flavor of the liver was complemented well by the onions. The layer of pistachios on top made it texturally more interesting but might've put the flavor off balance. It left me yearning for a slice of red onion or bosc pear even.\n\nFor our main entrees, we ordered the Whole German Brown Trout with carrots and cumin, and the Red Wattle Country Chop with fingerling potatoes, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and dill. \n\nMaybe the menu writer hadn't thought of this at the time (just as I hadn't until my husband laughingly pointed this out) but the term \"brown trout\" is slang for something pretty unsavory, something more likely found in toilet bowls than on dinner plates. Nevertheless, we ordered it and savored it! The fish was de-boned, the flesh was firm, the taste was mostly buttery, and we detected a little mint in there as well.\n\nThe chop was very juicy and flavorful, surprising to me given that the meat comes from a heritage breed of pig that used to be passed over for other breeds that had higher fat/lard content. Of the dishes we ordered, the red wattle chop is definitely a meal to come back for next time.", "author": "June W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-09-16", "description": "Tried a yellowtail neck they cooked for a food event in Brooklyn yesterday.

Em and I were seated basically right away, which I suspect had to do with it being before 7pm on a Wednesday, because by the time we left it was packed to the gills (it's not big). But the place is adorable, and the servers were very attentive and accommodating, despite getting swamped pretty quickly after we got there.\n\nAnd the food, my god the food... we shared an oven roasted octopus appetizer that was SO tender as well as the soup du jour, a chestnut and honey puree that was in the running for the best soups I've ever had (and you know I like some soup). Then I had the the roasted wild boar shank over polenta and Em had a fresh organic salmon, and we shared a side of brussels sprouts. All were outstanding, the boar was so tender and roasted in an amazing almost-asian-spiced glaze, and the salmon was crazy fresh, served rare with a horseradish cream; the brussels sprouts were well-roasted, sweet and citrusy with a little red pepper kick. And lastly, we shared a grapefruit tarte that was more like a un-br\u00fbl\u00e9e'd cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  We ate every single bite of everything we ordered.\n\nI could see the place getting crowded and maybe less pleasant -  I saw some later arrivals having a hard time getting seated and being dealt with a little more matter of fact-ly, but considering this was just days after a (second) NYT write-up on a comparatively warm early March evening, I was blown away. And hell, that soup (and that boar) would be worth a wait!!

The space is reminiscent of a cabin in the country. Food is also top notch. Duck liver mousse is a great starter. In terms of entrees, the chicken is easily one of the best around. It's a must order (and i never order chicken at a restaurant). The pork chop is also awesome. Huge portion. They're definitely not shy in terms of cooking it closer to medium rare. I wish more places would do that. If you like salty desserts get the salted caramel custard. Awesome. Wait times can stretch to an hour during peak times so grab a drink at the bar.

You feel like you're in a different world, maybe Paris, with the rustic-renovated decor and big window on a quiet cobblestoned side street.  Though it fills up FAST-- we got there right as it opened at 6 (pre-St. Ann's Warehouse show) and there was quite a wait by the time we left.\n\nMy friend had the roast chicken and it was seriously out of this world. Sweet pea ravioli was small and simple but good on my side.  If you're feeling nutty they have (or at least when I was there) an $80 home-aged steak, definitely enough for 3 if not 4 people.  Someone near us had it and it looked like a nice special occasion kind of thing.\n\nDessert (caramel custard) was probably more than I needed, but still delish.\n\nService was a little odd-- waify nervous lady with unintelligible voice-- but probably just an off-moment.", "author": "Bess W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-14", "description": "I went last night with a new-ish friend.  I liked the food, she didn't (more on that below).  We arrived around 10:30 and so we got seated right away (the bar area was fairly crowded).  The service was friendly.\n\nAtmosphere:  homey, a bit rundown (I wish they would fix the decor/paint just a little as it comes across as a bit \"dirty\"; thankfully, the bathroom is the nicest place in here).   \n\nScene:  We played a game of \"guess how many people in here are wearing black-rimmed hipster glasses\".  It was about 1/3 of the people in the room.  While we were playing, a foursome came in, 2 wearing black-rimmed glasses.  Funny.  ;-)   \n\nWe had been joking with the waiter about how I got the \"little girl glass\" for wine (it was just a teeny-tiny bowl with no stem - like what you would put a tee light into).  I asked him for a regular wine glass (which I spied on another table and he forgot and brought me another \"tee light wine glass\".  I said, kiddingly, \"You said you would bring me an adult wine glass.\"  The guy to my right at the next table, froze in mid-water pour to stare at me.  The female across from him looked at me in disgust.  I laughed.  The waiter thought it was funny.  However, I was now the \"hated, non-hipster wench\". Yes, people, you may be jugded and looked down upon here so watch what you wear and what you say lest you be thought of as \"the man\". \n\nService:  Our waiter was friendly.  We joked with him (see above) and he was cool with that.  The busboy (who was wearing black-rimmed hipster glasses) whom my friend asked if he could change the (thrash) music, went over to change it immediately to something more dinner- and conversation-friendly.\n\nFood:  We split the Shaved Market Salad ($9) which I really liked and so did my friend.  We both thought the dressing (and the salad) was really light and fresh.  I got the Cast-Iron Chicken ($15).  I liked it but thought the sauce was a little too tart/lemon-y.  I also thought it was a little overpriced as it comes a la carte (you have to order sides, separately).  I ordered the squash ($8) as a side.  My friend ordered the octupus and was unimpressed.\n\nOverall:   Though I thought it was overpriced and the food could be a bit better, I would go again.  My friend wouldn't.  The staff is friendly; (the attitude comes from the patrons).  The streets were deserted when we came and deserted when we left (after midnight).

I've only been here once, for brunch, but my friends and I had been curious about it for months.

Not only was everything perfectly, deliciously prepared, but the combination of ingredients in all of our dishes perfectly, deliciously satisfied us.\n\nThe service fine, but I wished we had been seated in another section - I noticed there was a server who was being way more friendly and gracious with his section than ours was.

I had some delicious chicken liver mousse to start, and my friend really enjoyed her ravioli, but the rest was sort of over rated, over seasoned. \n\nThe cast iron chicken was alright but the sauce it was served with was really overpowering and quite acidic.  The whole place kept smelling of burn vinegar as well.  It might of been all mental, but does every bite have to include an acidic bite of vinegar to justify the name/neighborhood??\n\nAlso I wish the wait staff would drop the holier than that vibe from Freeman's.

Upsides, and some downsides...\n\nDownside: First impressions are key... I was kinda annoyed they made me wait until 5:30 to enter the place (I arrived at 5pm) -- I mean, I could have sat at the bar and at least would have been inside. Instead, I sat outside and waited. Then they didn't even let me (or anyone else) know when it was OKAY to come in. Thumbs down. That was kinda the trend as far as service goes, which other folks have mentioned on here. It's blase, and keeps in line with the \"we're so cool, we just don't even care\" / hipster thing. \n\nUpside: All else aside, the food was really solid. Started with something very new for me, a special seafood app - anchovy (!?) on top of toast w/ olive oil, fresh cherry tomatoes, basil. Really a knockout, and adventurous for me. Glad I went with the waiter's recommendation on that one.\n\nThen onto the braised short rib which was so tender and delicious. Also had the fresh tomatoes and I couldn't get enough of them. A tiny bit of blue cheese added just a hint of something else that made this dish something I'd come back for -- except with such an interesting menu that changes frequently, I would probably try something else next time. \n\nBut, the downside: Hitachino White Ale was $9 for a less than 12 oz. bottle. Seriously? I suppose a total meal of $50 was more or less reasonable for a beer, appetizer and main dish.\n\nThen again, an upside: The outdoor patio in the back looks so picturesque, it just might break your camera lens. \n\nOverall impression: This is a restaurant for the \"too cool\" class of hipster, but then again this type of Broklynites love its farm fresh produce... the use of only the freshest vegetables is going to set this place apart. I also have a feeling your food will be better if you eat earlier in the evening, since you'd be more likely to get fresher ingredients. The decor is great for a place like this... very old and homey, and I'm sure warm/cozy in the wintertime -- it all works... the food, the atmosphere, the decor, the neighborhood. \n\nAnd the soundtrack: David Byrne \u0026 Elliot Smith?
