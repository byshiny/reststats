Quick rundown: \n\n- It was a ton of food... I ate half, then stir-fried the other half later and it was amazing\n- Maybe too much protein?

Their system is simple and quick: pick a rice or noodle, a meat (protein), 2 veggies, garnishes, and presto!  You have an inexpensive tasty, mouthing watering meal for $10. I picked the noodles \u0026 green rice (yes, you can pick two), the roast pork with the sauce, \nEggplant \u0026 green beans, and salty pickle garnish.  This is not Chinatown type food, but close to authentic as it will get in downtown Brooklyn.  The eggplant was cooked to perfection, not too mushy, and the green beans were skimmed through oil before being saut\u00e9ed so they had some crunchiness-very good and tasty.\n\nMy daughter had the green rice, spicy fried chicken, green beans and a broccoli \u0026 carrot medley. \n\nAt first, I thought about combining two proteins: roast pork \u0026 the Ma Po Tofu, a natural combo for a Chinese dish, but the server said it would cost an extra $3, so I declined.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, small, but adequate for a fast food setting.\nBeing Asian, I can say this without this being a racist remark:  I was glad to see two brothers (Asians) cooking in the back, who came out front regularly\nto check on the food quality \u0026 quantity.

You basically pick a base, a protein, two veggies, and unlimited toppings.  I looked at the reviews ahead of time and noticed that the green fried rice was the popular choice and decided to choose that as my base, tofu as my protein, and Sichuan eggplant and garlic string beans as my veggies.  It was a bit pricey at a little bit over $10, but it was a lot of food.  It's safe to say that I was left feeling a little disappointed.  I felt like I was eating overpriced Chinese takeout.  I will admit that the green fried rice was good and the Sichuan eggplant was super tasty, but everything else was pretty basic.  I didn't really find anything special with what I was eating, and the food was actually really oily.  There was a pool of oil at the bottom of my bowl, which is really unappetizing.  I'm just gonna say that I will probably not be back.", "author": "Liana M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-25", "description": "The food was very disappointing, overly saturated with grease.

Maybe we ordered the wrong things, so I'll likely try again, but basically... the noodles (our bowl base) had some Szechuan flavoring in it that I wasn't expecting (though I'll say I'm biased because I'm not a fan of Szechuan-style food), and the mapo tofu (our protein choice) was slightly on the bland side.

The employees are incredibly nice and don't just stare at you like at Chipotle or any other boring franchise fast casual place. The portions are huge. They really do not skimp on you. It's to the point where I feel like I have way too much protein and garnishes where I feel overwhelmed but in the best way possible because there's also a lot of rice so everything's amazing and balances out in the end.

Most reviews describe this place with the usual buzz words of high-quality and fast-casual. Those people are right, this is one of the few places in New York City where you can get high quality Chinese food in a casual setting and at a much lower price point. \n\nI got the Mala Chicken, Eggplant, and Green Bean all under a base of Scallion fried rice. The first thing you are going to notice is the sheer volume of food they give you. For around 10 dollars I got a massive amount of food I could not finish. You also get a pretty good rendition of Chongqing Chicken with plenty of fried Szechuan peppercorns. It's no Han Dynasty, but it's good. The real standout were the green beans. They were probably laced in some sodium-heavy sauce, but they were super good.
