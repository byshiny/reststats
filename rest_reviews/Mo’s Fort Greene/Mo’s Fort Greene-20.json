I walked up Fulton Street and during my walk saw some old timers who lived around the Ft. Greene Place area. They gave me the 411 on how things have changed diversely. \n\nDecided to cross over to S. Portland and ran across several restaurant bars and chose to walk into Mo's as I couldn't resist the lively energy. It was a great choice, as the Nets were in the playoffs, and being shown on the few flat-screens along the back of the bar. On a normal day, I could see that the bar is fairly spacious with high-tops along the opposite side of the bar, with enough space for food orders. But on this particular day, it was a tight squeeze just to get to the middle bar area. Everyone I encountered were pretty friendly, someone actually put in my drink order for me. The atmosphere was pumping with the game and the DJ playing hip hop in the background. During commercials they'd turn the music up and people would start grooving and the game would come back, then they'd concentrate on the game. Sports, plus a dance party? My kinda atmosphere. \n\nThe DJ has an actual DJ booth set-up and is located in an upper room towards the back of the restaurant. The walls are lined with album covers and there are comfy chairs and bench seating all around. I ultimately ended up staying back in this room, having my drinks and listening to the music. \n\nI didn't eat so I can't describe the food, but for my time here I enjoyed myself.", "author": "Pat F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-19", "description": "Recently went to Moe's. Me and my friends sat on one of the benches in the back with a small table and apparently there is a \"two drink minimum\" to sit in these seats. This is what our sever told us. Though I planned to order a drink when I was READY, the server came to us twice asking us for our order BEFORE she told us about this \"policy\". It made me not feel thrilled to order anything at all. I don't completely blame her because it seems like this was instilled by management.\n\nAbsolutely a thumbs down in service. We did order drinks but even after this, the check was brought to us immediately. We didn't even have time to think of a second round (not that we really wanted one regardless). I give two stars due to the good music.

I went to have drinks to celebrate my birthday with a few friends, as we were behind the front gate that separates it from the public sidewalk a random gentleman came asking us to quite down for his neighbors. We were completely caught off guard but after letting him know it wasnt a problem for us to respect his wishes,  even though were at a bar and didn't know who we was we kept our cool as we didnt see the point in being rude or attempting to argue with him especially since it was my birthday. We then simply asked who he was trying to introduce ourselves and engage with him  being friendly.  He then began to raise his voice and state how long he had lived in the and how he was the owner etc.This was a black Male speaking at black young professionals who were simply trying to turn a weird encounter into a good one. As we began to explain to him we were just asking with intent to have a conversation, another patron came out stating how he is always rude to black people. He then threatened to call the cops on us for simply trying to go on with our night. After stating to him in a respectful tone and manner about how we did nothing wrong and have been patrons before they had weekly events, a dj, and cash bar and we had never experienced a bad situation he began to back off. Of course before he walked off he just had to Express how he appreciates white patrons over black people.

I've been a frequent visitor since 2007. Always been a cool spot to get drinks, dance and meet cool people any day of the week. The last few years they have gone down hill. The security treats people so badly. They're rude and way too aggressive. It's a bar not a club. Relax. The last time I went I wasn't feeling it at all. I met a couple there who also decided to leave because their security checked them like they were criminals. So not cool and because of their unprofessional security who thinks their correction officers or cops searching criminals, I'll be finding a new spot. Just because the neighborhood is now gentrified doesn't mean you should mistreat people who have supported your business for years.

Yes, the patronage heavily skews black, but they're welcoming to everyone as long as you follow the strict dress code listed on the front door (no sweatpants, flip flops, tank tops, du rags, hats, etc.). They take the dress code seriously (like way too seriously). The place itself is split between a lounge area with couches, a tiny dance area in the back, and a narrow bar in the middle that makes it difficult to move around or stand.

Been going here for years! It's a go to spot for me and my friends when we want to just chill and talk. Nightlife is even amazing. But if I can be honest and give this like 3.5 stars, I would. I don't know if it's because of new management over the years I want to say 2014/15 this place kind of just fell off. Stopped serving appetizers and entrees and woke of the waitress and bartenders have off days( and granted we all do) but I don't get it how they all having it at the same time. But when they not having that off day it's a good time there. I don't know, maybe bring back that guy with dreads under his management things was calm.

We invited some more friends to come hang with us. The bouncer turns them away at 9:30pm! His reason too many guys not enough girls. Now we're inside shocked because the place is empty. Definitely no more than 20 people. We asked security about the policy we were just met with super aggressive attitudes. So then we asked the bartenders and waitresses, like do y'all not want to make money. She's like yeah why? I'm like why is security turning away patrons we've been here spending plenty money and invite more friends and they're getting turned away cause there are too many guys.

I will say that I had a blast. Although this bar seems to be frequented by Blacks and Latinos, there was a nice variety of folks and the place is pretty laid back and chill. One has to admit with the changing racial make up in Brooklyn, I have noticed that many bars pretty much segregated - not like Jim Crow segregation. I did not really experience that here. Plus, the people, no matter the background, seem cool and easy to talk to.  The bartender, whose name that I forget, working on sunday (Nov 8th) was really sweet and cool. I would order drinks from her any day. I cannot say too much about the place because I had only 2-3 drinks, which is about 45-60 minutes when I am already drunk.
