I've lived a few blocks down from Clark's for 7 years and they are consistently great.  The Clark's poached eggs are served on very crispy potato pancakes that are to die for!  This is always my go to when I order from this place, but their coffee is great and so is their french toast.  The only thing that I've ever had from here that was just OK is the BLT as it doesn't automatically come with mayo - that's a critical component!  Overall I think it is slightly pricier than your average diner but this place is very clean, excellent service, and I've never had a bad meal.", "author": "Rachelle R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-23", "description": "I first discovered Clark's when I was walking around the neighborhood while apartment hunting, trying to get acquainted with the area. Though I didn't end up moving there, Clark's would absolutely become a major go-to for me if I lived around there. It's a diner, but super classy and well-kept. They had lovely relaxing classical music playing, and the service was so top-notch you may as well have been in a white tablecloth restaurant. \n\nIt seems to be a popular spot for breakfast, but I highly enjoyed my dinner there as well. They have a huge menu of dishes ranging from a pizza burger to a steak dinner. My turkey burger was fresh and tasty, and the fries were perfectly prepared - not one mealy fry in sight! \n\nThe thing I keep going back to is how quick, professional, and friendly the service was. It warms my heart to know that in an age where everyone seems to be rushing you in and out of businesses, Clark's makes it a point to create an environment that makes you want to linger!", "author": "Christina P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-24", "description": "Great place for brunch! Everyone is so nice. Saturday's and Sunday's are packed, but host gets you seated as soon as possible. The longest I've waited is about 10 minutes. Once you're seated the waiter will bring you coffee and juice and take your order if you're ready. They bring the food out quick! I recommend the avocado Benedict or the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich with home fries.", "author": "Shelby A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-11", "description": "I am SO glad that I ate at Clark's this morning. Classy atmosphere - they're playing Beethoven, it sounds like. Really nice decor. \n\nBut what deserves a huge round of applause is their NEW YORKER - Salmon Benedict. Wow. \n\nI practically live for breakfast. This Benedict was hands down the best I've had in a year. \n\nNo doubt I'll be back here many times. Probably before the week is out. \n\nGreat job, Clark's!

I keep going back again and again because a close friend of ours lives nearby and Brooklyn Heights has so few choices.\n\nIt's habitually overcrowded, the service is rude (except for the manager, he's very friendly) and the food is \"meh\" at best.\n\nOn Saturday morning my group of 5 was seated in a corner booth (which seats 4) and the first thing to go wrong is that they had no coffee.     NO COFFEE????     You are a diner, you need two things:   coffee along with air for your customers to breathe.   Just TWO things.\n\nRather than being asked when our order was being taken \"how do you guys want to split this up?\"   or \"separate checks\" the waiter just took our order in a rush.\n\nMy order had whole grain toast, instead I got whole wheat (yes, there's a difference, and in fact their menu even offers the two choices).\n\nThe final strike was the worst... our waiter was incredibly rude (even raised his voice at us) when we indicated we needed to split the check.  The answer was simple, write a line down the center of the check as the top three orders were on one check, and the bottom two orders were on the next.   He made a huge ordeal out of it and embarrassed all of us in front of our two out-of-town guests.\n\nI've never had a single experience at Clark's that was enjoyable, but this probably was the last time as our dear friend e-mailed us a menu of another place nearby.\n\nGoodbye Clark's ... won't miss you.", "author": "J M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-06", "description": "I have been going to this wonderful diner for years.  The service is great with Caeser always making sure you have your meal the way you want it     Mark is always planning new menus selections, and the store is always run well and clean as a whistle.

They didn't have the Yankee bean soup that they just decided not to make today after advertising they make it every day.\n\nI was disappointed but still wanted soup, so I asked for just a little sample of the other 2 (a very common practice at diners) and they refused.\n\nWhen I told him I was going to leave over this he said good just get the fuck out of here!

It was a short walk through Cadman park from the subway stop. There were 2 couples ahead of us but we were quickly seated at a delightful window seat.\nWe each ordered the \"big breakfast\", mine with Brioche French Toast while my husband chose the pancake combo. Each entree is accompanied by coffee, a small fresh squeezed OJ, bacon, sausage AND ham. My \"over medium\" eggs were cooked perfectly as was everything else on my plate.  We enjoyed the sausage in particular.\nWe added a large OJ as we remembered it was that good...it was excellent!

While he was quick and efficient, our waiter was unpleasant despite our best efforts to be friendly and accommodating customers.\n\nFood was great! Order a large orange juice...

They know how you take your coffee (as a regular) and make you feel like family. \n\nThere's a reason they're frequently packed (and you still get a table quickly, and with elbow room)!  They have breakfast all day and there's so much on the menu that I've actually gone there for breakfast AND dinner without feeling like I'm eating the same thing twice in one day. I've never had a bad meal here. And their fresh squeezed real orange juice is a treat! Their pastas \u0026 burgers are delicious, their yankee bean and split pea soup are also homemade and are so good that I get some to take home. If you're a grilled cheese or a pancakes person (try the Mocha pancakes), they never disappoint!\n\nYou can tell the staff care about getting it all right, and they do. Clark's easily becomes a staple of living in Bklyn Heights, where there are fewer restaurants than there used to be, but it holds its own, regardless.

Read the reviews and thought I'd give it a shot. \n\nIn the late afternoon on weekday the place is very bare and you can just walk in and sit down wherever you like. The waiter was very attentive and knew when I was ready to order. It's a pleasure when you don't have to call anyone over to do that. I ordered the California burger deluxe and it arrived fairly quickly. When I requested mayo for the table, not only did the waiter bring that, but also brought a bottle of mustard. Thinking ahead - a good sign.\n\nThe burger was enjoyable. I wouldn't say it is over the top though. It seemed a bit under-spiced though. The half-avocado that came with it was great. The fries were basic stick fries, but they were very well done and crispy, so very fun to eat. \n\nI'd actually want to come back and try the pasta dishes, they looked quite enticing. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Zack M."}], "servesCuisine": "Diners", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Clark\u2019s Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "80 Clark St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/_1T55JW7JQ-s8XZ_tOtNfg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188555484"}
