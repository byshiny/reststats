Something I really do because I really think his prices are too high and all you're really getting is a bowl of noodles and one or another form of the cheapest meats (chicken or in this case ground beef). Now to justify his $9.50 + tax price He says the meatballs are made from ground VEAL--fancy for baby cow, and is the reason for only giving you 3 meatballs. But okay...I'll rock with it. I work hard enough, and the meal (for me) is 2 sittings. \n\nBut my people...that means I should be getting everything in flavor don't you think? As always the pasta was prepared in the sauce of your choosing (in my case tomato sauce) to help enhance the flavor of the meal. Enhance my ass! Those were some of the most TASTELESS meatballs. I mean really...VEAL or NOT...salt and pepper, oregano, basil, parsley and garlic are the Staples for seasoning in Italian food. Meatballs or GROUND meat. How about using some of those seasonings in the preparation of them? So I mostly ate the linguine pasta that it was prepared with and the one little piece of dry bread (not even garlic bread) that they give you and brought the remainder of my lunch home. TODAY I'm having the remainder of my lunch with just a sprinkling of those simple seasons I mentioned, but my food tastes EXPONENTIALLY better.", "author": "Dionne N.

The staff are zombies in a production line of bread, bagels and cheese. The manager is rude who mutters under his breath his displeasures whether it be with staff or customers.

However, going forward I will personally be boycotting Lucianos due to the manager of the establishment. He is unbelievably rude, and on multiple occasions, he has approached myself and coworkers for silly reasons. We have been kicked out of the outdoor seating area, because not all of us got our food from Lucianos. Today, myself and another coworker were sitting inside, and we were kicked out, although I was eating a full entr\u00e9e ordered from Lucianos and my coworker had a snack from next door. He said 'No Outside food allowed' and 'This is not a food court'. He then offered to allow us to sit outside, and we mentioned that he had previously kicked us out from the outside area for the same reason. He is rude, clearly bored, and I have seen him approach other customers as well for trivial things. The food is mediocre, and overpriced, and most people go to Lucianos simply because it is convenient. I will be taking my business, and my fellow coworkers business else where.

The outdoor patio area is very nice. Inside, it was a bit more crowded at the time, around 7 PM. The cocktails I had, Cape Codders and one Mai Tai, were mixed well and economically price about half of what I usually spend in the city. The food my friend and I had, BBQ Chicken and then a Margarita Pizza were delicious! By the time Karaoke was in full swing, the earlier crowd left so it became more comfortable with the much friendlier patrons still enjoying the evening. The staff was attentive.

I asked for an Omelette and the guy making my omelette proceeded to use the same bowl he used to make some else's omelette with out washing it out (1) .  (2) He takes the same used bowl and puts it inside a garbage can next to the grill and knocks out the remains from the last persons omelette on the side of the garbage.  He then removes the same bowl and starts making my omelette.  At this point I'm puzzled because I couldn't believe WTF I just saw.  So I tell him what did you just do? Can you use a different bowl and he looks at me like I'm the asshole and preceded to use another bowl.  After letting this settle for a few seconds and analyzing.  I realized they only have three omelette bowls that they don't wash because they don't have a sink near by and they repeatedly rotate the three bowls while banging out the excrements on the inside of the garbage each time. This is absolutely unacceptable and deplorable and saddens me because I really like this place.  I immediately spoke to manager who stepped in and removed the bowls.

Easy! \nThe manager is a total asshole. He lacks customer service skills and that severely took away from the food, decor, price etc. I ate there today(Dec 18 2014) and since I was dining in they put my food in a ceramic bowl. I was not able to finish all of my food, so I requested a to-go bowl. I was given a metal pan with a plastic lid. I requested the plastic bowl, they didn't want to give me plastic. The girl behind the counter simply said \"We are not allowed!\". I ask to speak to a manager. A white male, short, thin, with a dark green button down polo shirt with a red horse on the pocket and slightly balding comes out and says the following things:\n\n-When you eat in and you think you are not going to finish your food you should get your food in a to-go (plastic) bowl.  (So now I'm psychic about if I am going to finish my food. )\n-It costs him too much money to give everyone who wants their food to go a plastic bowl (really?! They sell those at the .99 cents store and as a business owner you buy in bulk- so WTF)\n-He has to pay the cost of cleaning the dine in bowls that people eat out of and has to factor in the cost if one gets broken. (seriously!)\n-He hasn't raised the prices of the food there in along time and it is attributed to his not giving out plastic to people who dined in. \n-While he said all of this his finger was mere inches away from my nose because he was holding his finger up to make a point\n\nHe said he would give me the bowl as a \"one time courtesy\" for free, because the price is usually a dollar. \n\nPlease note: Luciano's is not cheap food. The average meal is like $9-12. The fact that he acted like this is ridiculous. \n\nI was so appalled by his attitude I have no intentions of EVER eating, or drinking from this place again.

Came in for breakfast. Few customers in line near cashier and no signage saying where line starts, so we get in line for the cashier. Place our order and pay. Fifteen minutes pass before we realize we were supposed to first order and get our food from the cook line right before the cashier line. No signage saying this. \n\nSo we figure it out, tell the staff, and the cooks are making our food. Bagel and cream cheese. Worker makes it, throws it to the cashier, and barks at me to go get it. No other customers around so she could have handed it to me. Owner watching us, staring daggers.\n\nWe sit down, start eating. Husband gets up for the bathroom, accidentally walks through seating area marked \"this area closed\". Owner (or manager?) meets him at the other end and harangues him for walking through. Husband says he's sorry. Just wants to use the bathroom. He pushes open the door with the man/woman bathroom symbol, but oops! It's a computer closet. Owner is watching him and snaps that the bathroom is the next door. Which is marked \"woman\". More confusion. Husband gets back, owner watching us, still staring daggers as we finish our food. \n\nWe had a few awkward bumbles, but the lack of signage, unhelpful workers, and owner who seemed personally offended by our presence made us feel like we were stupid people and unwelcome.
