I am one of those cult members. \n\nThe appetizers are delicious, especially the pate platter and the croquettes. The latter is stuffed with mushrooms and minced truffles. They were perfectly fried; crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. \n\nAs for my entree I opted for the burger during this visit. I must admit, the meat was a bit over cooked but fortunately the melted foie gras made up for this uncommon mishap. \n\nMy advice: get there early for happy hour oysters and stay for a few drinks and appetizers.

They have a great cocktail program - the kind where at least one ingredient in each drink will make you go \"hmm\". They even have a drink featuring foie gras! I had the bacon infused rye whiskey drink because bacon. Equal parts yum and strong. Cocktails are reasonably priced at $12. Super cool bartenders as well!

You have to get this! Portions are big and the chicken was fried to perfection and it was juicy. 5 STARS\n\n- Mushrooms, Cheese, Spinach Crepe - very filling. Very delicious however it was slightly on the salty side. 4 STARS.\n\nCONS:\n- Chez Moi Cocktail (Vodka, Fresh Mint, Lime, Cr\u00e8me de Cassis, Seltzer)- was rec'd by the waitress to get this but I did not like it. I did not taste the Creme de Cassis at all in this drink. It was mostly vodka and fresh mint. \n\n- I had heartburn from drinking the cocktail with the fried chicken. I guess next time I am not going to mix alcohol with greasy and fried food.

The pamplemousse cocktail pairs well with the HH oysters, which are fresh. Th shucker needs a bit more practice as there was some grit and oysters not released.

Having Chez Moi around the corner from where I live makes it a convenient choice for fine French dining in a cozy small setting typical of Brooklyn Heights. I stopped in for a late dinner last week around nine and was treated very warmly and immediately seated in a cozy banquette. I waited for a few minutes then the waiter arrived and took my drink order and brought bread. The bread was amazing and without question one of the best baguettes I've had in my neighborhood. I ordered the French onion soup and the fennel artichoke salad, keeping it somewhat light.  The French onion soup was full of flavor and absolutely delicious and piping hot. The salad was good with a nice flavor but could have used a bit more tanginess or brightness. or crunchy tidbit on the side. To end my dinner I ordered the cream Brul\u00e9. It was light yet creamy and rich with the perfectly toasted sugary top. It's worth every calorie, add an espresso and BOOM!  \n\nOverall my experience was very nice, and in the French style, chill and not rushed. My next visit I will get something a bit more hearty with the French onion soup again, and always finish with the cream Brul\u00e9 and espresso. \n\nI highly recommend Chez Moi, it's a neighborhood gem, and don't forget to check out their sexy French jazz club downstairs - La Boudoir, a cozy place to get a fabulous craft cocktail. My favorite always is the French 75 with cognac. A good way to end the evening.", "author": "Sandy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-08", "description": "My wife and I are \"Regulars\" here and appreciate the fish dishes in particular.

Seriously, don't you supposed to do all prep before restaurant opens? Ok, we got different drinks unread. \nThan oysters mixup happen - waitress did not seem to know which ones were which for reorder, which led to series of trips to the kitchen. When that was in progress, a guy walked by our table and dropped drink on the edge - not a word said. What? Did he leave it there to drink later??? All confused, we stare at it. Flagged that guy 5 min later - turned out, they did find that bacon infused drink. Ummm, ok.\n\nI really hope they get their service issues together - this has lots of potential.", "author": "Nadia Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-24", "description": "My husband and I live in Brooklyn Heights and this is by far our favorite local restaurant- by leaps and bounds.

Yes you heard it right! \nWe were in the neighborhood walked around to check out restaurant options. This restaurant looks cozy and not busy so we decided to give it a try. It was Sat night around 6:30, the restaurant is more than half empty. We walked in and stood there for 5 mins without being greeted, 3 ladies ignored us and they weren't doing much, finally store manager came to us and asked if we had a reservation. We didn't and they took us to a table right outside of restroom. We glanced around and asked to be seated in the bigger table or the booth. The waitress said she had to ask and came to say, the table is only for more than two people and pointed to another side table just as small. Then we turned around and saw they immediately seated two white couple in the booth seat we asked for within minutes.\nSo if you are not white, be ready to be mistreated and the seats don't fit their price tag!

We asked for the table at the entrance right next to an open window, and got seated right away. That table was perfectly romantic in its own uninterrupted corner, rarely even looked upon by people other than our waiter or the manager, thus I highly recommend for couples. \nThe bread served before meal was true French baguette, even though it wasn't right-out-of-the-oven fresh, it was still million times better than the dry and harsh Americanized baguette. We shared a French onion soup which amazed my bf by its layered flavors. I also liked that it was actually flavorful but not overly salty, but imo it still lacked that flaky on top but buttery underneath croissant \"lid\" to be a perfect French onion soup. For entr\u00e9e, he got the fish of the day and I got the Seared Duck Breast. Even after it was repeated twice, I still couldn't remember all the ingredients in the daily special dish, but holy cow was it flavorful, we were both blown away upon the first taste. I could taste all the visible ingredients while feeling the smokiness of the crispy fish skin and the tenderness of the fish fillet. It was so well orchestrated, no one flavor was overwhelming or missing. My entr\u00e9e was the same way. The meal was perfect in the way that it left us full to just the right extent but mentally longing for more. The dessert Tarte Tatin was good for finishing off the meal and in good portion for sharing. \nI would definitely come back and try more items from the menu. I love this place. \n\nP. S.

Our server was very attentive without hovering around. Great ambiance with very cozy-feeling lighting.\n\nI was expecting small portions, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the portions to be the perfect amount for me. Run-through of the food:\n\nEscargots - Oh. My. God. The garlic parsley butter. The snail itself was soft, buttery deliciousness. All I can say is, Mmmm...\n\nWild Skate Fish - The fish was a little too salty for my taste, but mixing it with the mashed potato balanced it out. I really enjoyed the fava beans and artichoke, and I'm usually not into beans of any kind.\n\nSeared Duck Breast - This is a must order. The meat is so tender and juicy, and the orange sauce paired really well with the duck flavor.\n\nTruffle Oil Risotto Special of the Day - This was good, but a couple of bites were enough for me. It was rich and creamy.\n\nCreme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Smooth as silk with a nice burnt sugared top. \n\n\u00cele Flottante - One of the most amazing desserts I've ever had.
