There can be a wait during rush times, but the service is always good once you get a table. A tad expensive but worth it in my mind. I love that they make their own tofu and all their tofu dishes that I've tried are delicious, (I love agedashi tofu) including the tofu pudding for dessert. Also love their Japanese tapas and of course their sushi rolls.\n\nI've heard the lunch specials are good too but haven't been for lunch.

The food was average small portion of sushi sashimi , the Uni was really good and I really recommend the chicken teriyaki . The reason I gave 3 stars was because usually the way I give tips is by giving 20-23% of the total before tax .

The Kyoto-style sushi is always fresh and delicious, as are all of the cooked small plates. The agedashi tofu is some of the best I've ever had. The fried oyster roll is the best thing I've ever tasted. The service is friendly and attentive.

We tried the standard hot and cold as well as the agedashi (fried) to get the full experience, and they were all fantastic. Smooth texture, nice consistency, and a full and complex flavor of its own that's really rare. \n\nFor entrees, we had the beef kakuni and the miso salmon. The beef kakuni is rightly featured in a lot of reviews, and I agree with the hype. The slow cooked pork is appropriately soft and flavorful, and when paired with the house tofu and a full/salty broth, every bite was a complete and delicious experience. The miso salmon which was a nice example of the dish. I'm less enthusiastic in my review because it's something I've seen done in similarly positive fashion at a number of other Japanese restaurants, but it was very good and a nice option if you're in the mood for Japanese-style cooked fish. \n\nWe weren't terrifically impressed by the obanzi (spicy shrimp and a mushroom soup) - fine but nothing amazing. The tskemono was fine and is highly recommended as a counterpoint to the richness of most of the entrees. \n\nIn terms of ambiance, brightly lit room full of people clearly enjoying themselves. Our wait staff was very friendly, explained the options and provided additional details when asked. All in all a very nice experience. Probably a 6-7 on the formality scale - I saw some people a little dressed up for dates but I felt perfectly comfortable in my jeans and flannel.", "author": "Daniel E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-25", "description": "The tofu was excellent as everyone says.

The food was really good, all the dishes we ordered were tasty, fresh, and good quality. It seems like a family friendly restaurant. We came here on both Friday and Sunday nights, and noticed there were parents with their toddlers. It did really bother us. \nThe only issue that we had was the service. When we came here the first time,  we ordered the sushi plate which came with one roll and assorted sushi. It was surprisingly delicious that we wanted one of the tasty sushi. So we asked our server about what specific sushi we got in our plate, since we didn't know all the name of the fish. The server told us that pinkish sushi should be Skip-jet, so we ordered it. However the sushi came out different from what we ate. So we told the server, she tried to say that is what we wanted. After we explain to her again, she changed it to bonito sushi and warned us that we can't change it again!!! I don't know what's wrong with her!! Seriously, wee didnt know whats on our first plate, so we asked her which sushi was it in our sushi plate and would like to order one more piece. Now she is telling me that we ordered the wrong thing!! Super rude!!!!She didn't really apologize at all. I think that service was only 1~2  star.\n\nOne more thing, the waiter and waitress collected the plates without asking us if we finished our food. They just sneakily reached to The table and took the plates or menu away. That's extremely rude. \n\nThe food is really good but the service still needs to be improved!!", "author": "Sharon C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-17", "description": "I am absolutely enchanted with Hibino. I went here for dinner once with the hubs then took lunch to go a month or so later. Dinner was amazing. The sushi was just so delicious and the I was so surprised by the tofu (which we ordered on a whim because of all the outstanding reviews). This is one of our favorite spots now. \n\nHowever, the shining star in my mind is the lunch special. You cannot go wrong. I was in the mood for a nice little bento box one afternoon, and what I got far exceeded my expectations. I was absolutely blown away by the finely prepared yellowtail and the humongous portion! Even the rice had a deliciously different flavor. All for $10! This should have been three times as expensive. \n\nGo, order, eat, enjoy... you cannot go wrong with this adorable gem of a place.", "author": "Lauren R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-06", "description": "my husband and I went to Hibino on a Thursday night and were seated right away which was nice - there were people there, but it wasn't packed.  we'd been meaning to try this neighborhood place for years, and finally made it.\n\nthe homemade tofu is seriously to die for.  I squealed in delight over it - easily the highlight of my meal - so creamy.  my husband got several fish dishes which he thought were pretty good, and I opted for vegetarian that night - I was pleasantly surprised to see an umeboshi type of roll and really enjoyed it.

That is so important for a good Japanese restaurant. Japanese food is not just food it's a way of life that really can't be duplicated by other cultures. \n\"There are only two questions about food. Is it good? And is it authentic?\nWe are open (to) new ideas, but not if it means destroying our\nhistory. And food is history\"\n- Guiliano Bugial\nIn NYC ,all 5 boros included there seems to be an idea that authentic is better as long as it is authentic people will eat there. But even to the point where they will sacrifice quality and taste and eat in any trash hole. I beg to differ. I want Japanese food to be authentic and good not just authentic.

The restaurant is small; there is definitely a cozy feeling to it. Large windows surrounding the place allow for a lot of natural sunlight, which I personally like a lot. The d\u00e9cor is pretty standard, nothing that really stands out but it gets the job done.\n \nAlright, onto the food! The menu here isn't large, and that's a good thing. Many Chinese and Korean owned Japanese restaurants (for some strange reason...) tend to blow up their menus with dozens, if not hundreds of items. Hibino focuses on what they can do. \n\nService was prompt, and I ordered the Chirashi bowl (sashimi cuts over a bed of sushi rice). Took about 10 minutes for the order to come, and my first impression was \"Wow, this bowl is small...\" I'm a kind of guy who will compare and contrast the food I eat, so when I realized that the serving size was quite small, and the sashimi cuts were, instead of the traditionally layer cut I was accustomed to, cut into cubes, I was staring into a bowl with fish cubs on top of a bed of rice. It  wasn't what I was expecting, and I felt a little let down. To make matters worse, there was a piece of shrink wrap still stuck on one of the pieces of fish - not a good sign. That sort of derailed my appetite - I guess when I brought it up to the waitress, I expected a free appetizer or even a drink, but all I got was \"Oh that's there, it's to keep the fish fresh, but I'll take that piece away\" and nothing more... ok so proceed to eat, and I'm already disappointed. \n\nThe sashimi wasn't that great - sort of bland and rubbery tasting. If you've ever had sashimi that was frozen and then hastily thawed, then you know what I'm talking about. The cube of tuna wasn't fresh at all, and didn't have that \"melt in your mouth\" feature that most fresh, blue fin tuna cuts have. The rice was pretty tasty though, but you'd have to screw up REALLY badly to mess up the rice portion of a chirashi dish.\n \nI left Hibino poorer and still hungry. It was an underwhelming experience to say the least. The prices are unjustifiably high for the portions you get along with quality of the sushi/sashimi. Too bad, this place seemed like it could have been so much better, but the fish they served just didn't cut it for me. Perhaps their other non-sushi/sashimi dishes are of a much higher quality, but I tend to stick to sushi when I hit up \"authentic\" Japanese joints, only because I COULD eat the other non-sushi/sashimi dishes elsewhere like at a Chinese owned joint, whereas sushi is best left to those who grew up eating it or at least know a thing or two about it. \n\nHibino, for the most part, was lackluster and was not worth the price I paid for my food, but given the lack of high quality Japanese restaurants in Brooklyn, I'm willing to give it another go.", "author": "William W."}], "servesCuisine": "Japanese", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Hibino", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "333 Henry St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ZnQFG9rXkzx_yOtGuBi-FQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17182608052"}
