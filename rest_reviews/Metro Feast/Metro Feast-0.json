Although this place seems to be known for the buffet area, there are flies flying around during the summer time. Something about open air buffets are off putting to me and seem unsanitary. \n\nAs for the salads, small salads are $6 and large is $8 with 5 toppings each and a choice of protein. I usually get a large with kale, Cajun chicken, fresh mozzarella with French dressing. The large salad lasts me 2 meals. It is my holy grail since most places do not serve fresh mozzarella. \n\nI highly recommend the salads here!

You want sushi and noodles? They got it. Breakfast? Yep. Sandwiches? Mac and cheese? Fresh fruit!? They have it all.\n\nPrices are really great for the quality and freshness of their foods.\n\nThey have a huge selection of hot buffet items all day, along with a salad bar, breakfast bar, pressed sandwiches, Mexican, sushi, and a ramen/udon bar.\n\nI love their udon. Lots of ingredients and their broth is very flavorful. A huge bowl is less than 8$. Sushi is always fresh and well made, and very affordable.", "author": "Maggie C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-11-14", "description": "I've walked past this place a handful of times and never thought to go in until one day over the past summer. I was impressed with the food options; buffet style hot foods, salads,  fruits,  coffee,  etc.\n\nI was more than happy to grab the tropical probiotics mango and pineapple juice with a fruit salad.  I'm thinking of trying their hot food one day and definitely their coffee at some point. \n\nThe location is spacious and located right at the corner so it's visible. That particular block has more pampering establishments (nail, eyebrow salons, etc.) so it's refreshing to have a spot to go to for various types of food and beverages.", "author": "Jessy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-04-01", "description": "This has to be one of the best buffets in the downtown Brooklyn / Boerum Hill area!\nI'm a southern cook, but their brisket can give me a run for my money!

When they first opened i felt like the quality was better especially the hot food area. I do enjoy their breakfast sandwiches tho. \n\nI want to recount my last visits at establishment. I treated my team to breakfast a few weeks ago. One of the items i ordered was listed as 5.45, my colleague noticed the price when i got back in office and was like dang i buy that everyday and pay 4.25. Low and behold a few days later he orders the same thing with potatoes and pays 5.95. Im not sure if it was sexism at play but that was a real turnoff not to be consistent with your pricing.

Like the food made and oatmeal but haven't tried their breakfast buffet so I can't comment on that. Love the oatmeal and the fact you can add extra toppings provided by them. The only thing I would say I don't like much is that they don't  place fresh daily fruits. Sometimes they seem fresh and sometimes it seem like they have reused the same fruits from prior days.

In addition, from memory, they regularly feature a nice selection of salads (Greek, Caesar, seafood, mozzarella and cherry tomatoes); sausage and peppers; Chinese chicken; fried chicken; roast chicken (basically lots of different types of chicken); lasagna/pasta; hot mixed seafood; duck; char siu pork or other varietals thereof... And many more. This is not an exhaustive list but any means. \n\nThey also have a salad bar which looks pretty good but I've yet to try and a sushi and ramen bar which also look very tempting. \n\nNB - if you're coming for the deli come before midday. It's pretty quiet before then and the food is mainly undisturbed but come midday and the lunch rush hits the buffet begins to look like the remnants of the fall of Rome - the salmon disappears very quickly. \n\nOh, they also have a very good selection of snacks and drinks.", "author": "Tommaso S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-28", "description": "After passing this place for a while on the bus I was finally in the area to finally go in and grab some food. I think of this place as an extensive deli with an array of options. If you just want to grab some chips and juice you can do that, but you can also grab hot food which is situated in the middle of the establishment. For the most health conscious there is a section where you can create your own tossed salad made; and for those who enjoy sushi there is a place for you in the far right corner from the cashier.

Though I ordered a Cuban panini, I wound up with something that appeared to be roast beef and tomato or something like it. It was a decent sandwich, but most definitely not what I ordered.\n\nWhy am I giving this two stars? Speed and variety, and the assumption that other people mostly get their orders right.

Months of walking by and anxiously awaiting this deli opening has paid off.  Today is opening day and it is evident this has the potential of being a go to place on the way to the 2/3/4/5 subway.  \n\nThere is a variety of food.  The hot bar has numerous selections.  Refrigerated beverages to go. There is an udon bar and sushi. There is a sandwich bar as well. \n\nThe man behind the udon bar was incredibly nice and friendly.  He offered a sample of the soup- it was very tasty and spicy- great to warm you up on a cold day like today.  I couldn't help but then decide to actually sit and have a quick lunch. I had the salmon roll ($6.25).  It was fresh and tasty.  The seaweed salad ($3.99) was delicious and almost crunchy with a sprinkling of sesame seeds. \n\nThe cashier was also very friendly and apologized for not having chopsticks due to the brand new opening and offered me forks.  It seems like everyone is settling into the flow here.\n\nI can't wait to come back and hopefully be able to give it the full 5 stars.", "author": "Marjorie W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-20", "description": "I've only had their buffet and their iced coffee.
