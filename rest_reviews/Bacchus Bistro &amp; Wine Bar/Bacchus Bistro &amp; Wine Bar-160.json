The price was right and getting reservations was super fast and easy. We went for a quick dinner. Parking was a breeze.  We ordered off the Prix Fixe menu and everything was totally worth it. You can't go wrong for $26 a person.  We went with duck rillettes and snails. The mushroom ravioli was to die for. I don't usually eat creamy things but enjoyed the ravioli.

The service is excellent and the food is absolutely delicious. My husband and I went here for dinner on a Tuesday night and had the unlimited mussels. They give you a huge portion of mussels for every order you ask and they come in three different sauces.\u00a0I got them with garlic and white wine and my husband got them in a dijon sauce. They were both delicious. I absoultely recommend this place, and sit in the patio area which is nicely lit up and very cute.", "author": "Julie J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-01", "description": "I was summoned to Bacchus by the SO's crew. An excuse to come dine in Brooklyn is always good. Bacchus is the product of a very charming French expat who made sure we got the personal touch throughout the night.\n\nThe food was quite good. While several members of our party went for mussels, which are reputed to be outstanding here, I dove into a prix fixe (a dinner steal at $26 for 3 courses). This entitled me to a duck terrine appetizer, which was a cross between tartare and pate--very tasty; also, pork belly (I can't say no); and an explosively delicious slice of chocolate lava cake that erupted on the plate.\n\nThe wine is very reasonably prices (several glasses can be had for under $10), and you will want to order it, because the beer pickings are slim. But you're in a French bistro, so what are you doing asking for beer, anyway?", "author": "Yan T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-16", "description": "Go here for the atmosphere, not the food. The vibe is fun, so would probably be ideal for a group brunch. I went with my boyfriend and got the salmon burger, he had the crab benedict. We split French onion soup which was delicious.

Super intimate atmosphere and definitely a good date spot (candles everywhere!). Wine selection is good, but be prepared to be familiar with French wines (I was not, unfortunately, and stuck to a wine I recognized). The pork chop was fantastic (with a pineapple and mushroom glaze), though could have done with less fat. My boyfriend had the goat cheese gnocchi, which he thought was pretty good. We also shared a side of mac and cheese, which I thought was a bit too creamy. Desserts looked delicious, but we were too stuffed to try any.

While the menu provided some nice choices, we never had the opportunity to try any of them.  We were seated inside, in a moderately long but narrow area, across from a group of 10-12.  Whenever there was conversation and laughter within that group, the sound reverberated within this area, making it impossible for the two of us to hear one another.  We asked to be relocated and, despite the fact the restaurant was basically empty, we were told that was not possible.  Since it was impossible for us to enjoy our dining experience, we left.  Both my daughter and I found their lack of concern and  lack of customer service exceptional. It was made very clear that our patronage was not needed or appreciated.

Their chocolate cake, although I am not a sweet lover - was all my boyfriend could talk about for days. Really great wine choices as well.

My family and I came in for dinner on a Saturday night on October. We had previously come to the restaurant on Thanksgiving since my parents don't cook and our meal was very good. However, when we came back, the food was good but the service was terrible. I've never been to a restaurant where they brought only a single person's entree out and waited 30 minutes later to bring out everyone else's. Also, don't order the hanger steak here - it was almost impossible to chew.\n\nPros:\nDecent Food\nAmbiance\nWine\n\nCons:\nThe Service\nHanger Steak\nWaiting for Food", "author": "Sean C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-01", "description": "My friends and I came here for brunch right before the Atlantic Avenue Wedding Extravaganza. Love that they have a garden in the back for outdoor seating. It was probably one of the more relaxing restaurants with a garden i have ever been to. Very cute and Frenchy as well. You would probably expect portions from a French restaurant to be really un petit but their portions were actually huge and at a great price. For $8.95, I ordered eggs benedict with bacon which came in two along with potatoes and salad. I normally would be able to finish eggs benedict but this time, my stomach was calling quits when I was moving on to the second set of poached eggs. Not that they were bad.  But with the combination of the heat wave, my appetite simply shrunk.  I would definitely come back again...probably not during a heat wave though.\n\nNote: They have a cafe next door that sells their baked goods.

We sat out front, as the back patio was packed on a balmy evening, and that was fine. Service was friendly and efficient, the food arrived promptly, and it was all very tasty. \n\nI had the \"all you can eat\" mussels (it being Unlimited Mussels on Tuesdays), along with shrimp a la plancha as an appetizer. My husband had goat's cheese dishes - both appetizer and entree. He likes goat's cheese, you see. \n\nWhile we weren't blown away, the dishes were nicely cooked and the flavors were good all round. The shrimp were large, meaty and tender, and the mussels were very fresh and came in a lovely rich tomato and herb broth, with big tangy chunks of tomato swimming around in it. When mopped up with the fresh bread, it made for a wonderfully satisfying meal - I was too full to go for the refill on the mussels, somewhat to my regret! I'll have to go back again on a Tuesday and skip the appetizer this time...!\n\nPrice-wise, it was all pretty reasonable. Not cheap, but not overpriced for the area.

Staff friendliness, attentiveness and professionalism exceeded expectations. They let us come early to decorate and also helped with the process. It's very difficult to accommodate a party of 30 and our waiter was extremely understanding and patient. Food was great, dessert was ok. But we brought our own dessert so it wasn't a big deal.

We were very skeptical but were hungry and grouchy so we settled. Upon seated, our waitress quickly came over to tell us the specials for the night. In the midst of that, a couple was on their way out and told our waitress that they thought the music was loud, food was ok and service wasn't great. That should've been a red flag!\n\nBacchus offer an extensive menu and it's reasonably priced. We all decided to order from the Prix fixe which was $25 for 3 courses. We each had a different appetizer - chicken soup (tasted like can soup), escargot (the worst we ever had),  goat cheese with fig relish and duck rilettes on toasted bread (decent). For entrees I had the pan seared salmon which was average at best, my friend had mussels which was pretty good and the 2 guys had pork belly which they were utterly disappointed. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Sunday night, it was the 4 of us and a large party of 10-12 for a birthday celebration. \n\nIf I have to break down the ratings I'd say 4 stars for the ambiance and service, 3 stars for value and taste of the food.", "author": "Pamela L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "description": "Went for Sunday Brunch as part of a large group.\nPros: ambiance - nice romantic dimly lit place for dates.
