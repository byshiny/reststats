The wind blew a fist full of Atlantic Ave grit into my face, and I suddenly felt like I was running from a tornado.  We had 2 options.... race to the F train and try to beat the storm home, or make like a bandit over to Ki Sushi and wait it out... guess what we chose.\n\nAnd man we were glad that we did!  A little pricey as far as sushi joints go in Brooklyn, but well worth it.  Some very creative rolls.  The Ki roll was well worth it... gold and caviar and all.  The fish was very fresh and at the end of the day, that's all you really want from a good sushi place.", "author": "Ajay R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-06", "description": "Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! \n\nNo, it's not newbies reporting to Shawshank prison, it's a declaration of top quality fare from Ki. I absolutely love the place and the staff.

Nothing extraordinary with the food but the fish was fresh. The spicy tuna had a nice crunch at the end. \n\nThe staff were attentive and polite. We were seated in a nook by the window but they never forgot us. Nice ambience although it was too \"clubby\" for lunch. Especially hangover lunch. It should be nice for dinner though.", "author": "Jon L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-19", "description": "Best sashimi and special rolls I ever taste!\nI ordered the fashion roll and with the fresh scallop on the top it was just divine. When they write fresh they really mean that! You can feel the freshness and all the best flavors of  the fish. Besides they have  good variety of fishes. They were out of monkfish liver, but we were late and we will come back to this place because we don't want to miss it again!\nThe Toro tartare was delicious, maybe too tiny...\nThe sea urchin, perfect!\nThe place is beautiful, cozy and clean, perfect for couples.\nI was about to rate 4 stars because of the service.

The avocado melted beautifully.\n\nThe deep frying oil was not quite fresh, and the hot sake was vile - tho they slightly grudgingly changed it for a (much more expensive) cold sake, and only charged for the more expensive one.  The simple nigiri platter was passable.\n\nIf we're in the area and want some wildly inauthentic sushi rolls, then might give it another try.", "author": "Adam G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "I came here because I'm finally in Brooklyn (\u0026 not Williamsburg) while craving sushi so I figured might as well try a place with great reviews. We got in at 7:30 on a Friday night and waited about 30 minutes for a party of 3. You can leave your number with them so they call you when there's a table that opens up. I ordered the Ki Roll... there's plenty of pictures posted of it and yes it is delicious. My friends ordered the ice cream tempura and spicy girl (grill?) roll. \n\nThe rolls here are huggeee. They're about 1/3 bigger than the usual rolls and the price reflects that. Although the rolls are bigger, I don't think it justifies the premium of their sushi. My friend ended up paying about $32 for 2 rolls at this place... you can eat AYCE pretty good sushi for less than that.\n\nOverall food, ambience, and service were good but the price dampens my enthusiasm for this place significantly.", "author": "Ruby C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-05-09", "description": "Came for the sushi, stayed for the sushi. Ki offers some of the highest quality sushi you can get in the city; the price is reasonable as well. I've shared the Omakase for 2 for under $60. It featured toro, uni, scallop, and other quality fish. The miso soup was delicious as well.

They fly their fish in from Japan and it is consistently fresh. \n\nAlways have had good service \u0026 their sushi chefs are friendly.

Yes, by the 4 stars it's getting, I consider that low.  The reason being is that this place is too good for 4 stars.  this is the best bang for the buck as far as sushi places go.  No you're not going to get some top quality stuff from a $15 roll or $8 sushi.\n\nThis is why this place is great:\n\nBEST value.  It's almost priced like those crappy fusion roll places, but 10x the quality.\n\nFresh fresh fresh!  They claim the fish is shipped overnight from Japan's fish market.\n\nKi roll -- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tT6teP3ZfCAfvdPdDoqG4A?select=TlmqT4J6sh1HmqWSE1jhpA\n\nDelicious and just $14!

The wasabi cream is wonderful.  It has a nutty flavor that's so perfect with the lobster.  they tried to take my friend's plate away but he insisted on holding onto it for the wasabi cream so he can dip his other stuff in it.\n\nChirashi bowl -- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tT6teP3ZfCAfvdPdDoqG4A?select=HRWvqQL00gITcpnHxLEuZQ\n\nLunch special for $14.
