This not because I didn't necessarily like it but this sort of food especially in Brooklyn and the City simply aren't authentic enough. They tend to lack the bold, colorful flavors that Indian food is noted for. Nevertheless, I ordered take out from Curry Heights fully expecting this to be watered down and somewhat bland. \n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nI ordered the Goat Vindaloo and mulligatawny soup as part of their 2 course 13.95 special. First, I have to say this is a lot of food for that price. I spread it out over two nights. \n\nNow, for the food I was pleasantly surprised. The vindaloo sauce had the serious kick you would expect from authentic indian vindaloo. I was soaking the included naan (bread) in it and almost didnt have any naan left for the other sauces that were provided to dip the naan in. However, the food was not without its fault. The goat meat while somewhat flavorful alone did not have the fall of the bone tenderness as described in the menu and some pieces was unfortunately dry. Also, there seemed to be more potatoes in the goat vindaloo than goat. \n\nThe mulligatawny soup was delicious. It was thick and had the necessary (but downgraded from the vindaloo) heat that you want in a good indian soup. \n\nOverall, I was very impressed with this place and plan on making it my go to place for Indian food in Brooklyn for the foreseeable future.", "author": "Jonathan H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-03", "description": "I came here for the lunch buffet. The staff was quite friendly, even as I took a bit too long staring at the selections. I ended up with chicken tika masala and spicy dal soup, served in separate bowls with a side of rice and naan. The food was a little cool, even after sitting in warm trays. The flavors were a little on the bland side. The amount of food was generous, and not a bad deal at $8.66. The server was quite attentive in filling water, which was much appreciated. I left satisfied but without a strong desire to go back.", "author": "Ian M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-15", "description": "Wow.  I've never written an online review before, and I don't like the idea of being inspired to write my first by a horrible experience.  NEVERTHELESS... Wow.  This place sort of ruined my night.  First, the person who took the order was super rude, which normally I don't really care about.  Sometimes I think it can be chalked up to language barriers or what-not.  I laughed it off, even though I had to call back after the person took my address (but not my order yet), then set the phone down for several minutes.  I could hear him taking other orders in the background.  When I eventually told him I wanted to pay by credit card, he questioned me and tried to talk me out of it.\n\nI waited an HOUR AND A HALF, and finally called.  Someone different answered, and he was very deferential and apologetic. He said that they were very busy, but that the food was on its way.   ANOTHER HALF HOUR later the buzzer rang.  I went downstairs (I am in the top floor of brownstone, no buzz-in).  The delivery man had no pen for me to sign the charge slip with.  I told him it would be fine,  I told him just to sign it himself, that the restaurant would have no problem taking the money out of my account -he looked stricken - and closed the door.  He immediately started pounding on the door and shouting.  I opened the door, went back up to my 3rd floor apt. got a pen, and signed the charge slip.\n\nTHE FOOD.   There were none of the three sauces/garnish that normally come with an Indian food order.  The chicken in the Tikka masala was so overcooked it was hard to chew.  And the naan was inedibly undercooked - the dough was still, well, literally just dough on the inside.   I'm sorry but they really don't deserve to be in business.", "author": "Peter O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-17", "description": "Huge portions for good prices. Staff is super nice. We had a good experience eating here. The samosas are divine as is the basmati rice. I have had better naan but it was acceptable, especially when combined with other dishes.

Curry Heights has nice prix fix offering: appetizer plus entree with naan for $13.95.  Don't miss the tikka naan- it is delicate, puffy and slightly chewy.  Never been a big fan of samosas but these were less dense than most.  Loved the onion relish and \"green\" sauce which I always forget the name of.

Do not if there has been changes in ownership or management or what! The truth is it has gone downhill badly. To the point I just found myself out of options for Indian food in the neighborhood! The last few times, service has been terrible. After being clear about having the \"deal meal\", we got a check with all the items separated... The excuse, \"he is in training\", who they wanted to kid? As mentioned I've been a regular for a long time.

It is nothing special but is edible.  As an Indian, I can honestly say that this is the blandest Indian food I have ever had. However, the service absolutely sucks.  I have been here several times and they ALWAYS get our order wrong.  Without fail, it is always incorrect.  You will never get exactly what you order unless you make a huge stink about it.  It is pretty ridiculous considering it is the slowest takeout service on the planet.

I had a leisurely dinner there the other night, and though it took a while to get out food, everything eventually came out as promised.  I am not an expert on Inidan food, but I've had both good and bad, and this is definitely good.  The naan was fresh and plentiful, and the lamb in our stews was tender and flavorful.  The spices were spot on (to my judgment, anyway) and exciting.  And what a bargain!  Go for the two course special served during dinner hours (and perhaps lunch as well, I'm not sure).  For 13.95, you get crispy flatbread to start, an appetizer and main course with naan and rice, and rice pudding after your meal.  The beverages are interesting as well.  We tried the Indian Iced Tea and Drink of the East which were both fragrant and refreshing.\n\nGive this place you business.

Even though I check \"mild\" on seamless, the dish comes out very spicy every time.
