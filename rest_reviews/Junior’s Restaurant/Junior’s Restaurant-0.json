This is an old school diner with a full all day menu and old school vibe. The disco fries were our app and the gravy on them was awesome. The meal comes with bread, coleslaw, pickles and an awesome pickled beet salad. \n   We ended up full on the fries so took our BBQ rib entree and corn beef hash with poached egg entrees back to the hotel. We didn't end up with photos of those but the ribs were nothing but bones when hubby finished them. They came with steak fries that we didn't eat. The corn beef hash was pretty standard- but a solid breakfast item. Both entrees are pictured in yelp and ours looked just like the prior pics.\n  Of you want a good solid diner with INCREDIBLE cheesecake then this is a really good option. Service is friendly as you would expect in a diner and it's a great place to hang out, Sri I coffee and watch people.", "author": "Terrell B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-05", "description": "Visiting for the weekend from Florida.

We got takeout of one of the tiny mini cheesecakes and it blew my mind away. We even accidentally ordered chocolate but I still loved it (I wanted the original)!

I told myself only a few bites, and I barely made it out of Junior's it was almost done.\nABSOLUTELY phenomenal!! easily 10/10\n\nI have only had their breakfast once at least ten years ago and from what I recall, I really liked it.

If you love cheesecake this is better than the cheese cake factory. They make all of their cheesecakes on premises. They have a wide range of food selection for those that might just want to add a dessert to their their meal or just get a dessert by itself either way you can't go wrong.

(See previous review) the service was bad. But tonight the service was worse .me and my wife visited on 4/13/19  it was horrible I ordered a burger\nWith Swiss cheese and saut\u00e9ed onions they gave me a burger with red onions not saut\u00e9ed and it was on a plain hamburger bun that was too small for a burger of the size they're selling.

Rolls and cornbread basket, pickles, pickled beats and cabbage slaw. You know a restaurant is mindful of the culture it's part of when the food they serve reflect the various people in the community. My friends ordered Escovitch salmon with rise and peas, collard greens. I had regular salmon with rice Florentine and collard greens. Couldn't tolerate desert we were so full and Jr's is known for their cheesecake and pies. The leftover champagne from the mimosa was given to us to finish off. Coffee was great, met an 85 yr old man celebrating his birthday with his son and friends. Just an over all great environment with good soul food.

I was excited to try the infamous cheesecake and decided to eat there as well. My fish was perfect the side were nothing special but not bad. \n\nI was very disappointed with the cheesecake kinda skimpy for ny cheesecake, lacked flavor overly topped with berries.

While it probably will clog your arteries and make you die of betes eventually, it's worth it while the dense caloric dessert lasts. \n\nJunior's Cheesecake is a gem from the time before we fell prey to the gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, flavour-free trends, but oh well, that just means shorter lines for me.\n\nWe came here on a warm Friday winter evening and surprisingly were seated immediately for two groups of 10. The place really gives you that NY/NJ diner feel with all of the old-school memorabilia, but at the same time, I felt like the booths were crusted with half a decade's worth of crusted fountain soda.\n\nOur party had two steak burgers, a bunch of shakes and something terrifying sweet called the \"cookie monster\", and a slice of the original Cheesecake. The consensus from the group was that the food was meh, but the cheesecake was the bomb diggity. \n\nWas the experience worth $16 for a mediocre burger? Probably not.\nWould we come back for the vanilla shakes? Fat chance.\nDid I enjoy my chesecake? Hell yeah.\n\nI think the secret to Junior's is to stay for the cake, but avoid any of the tourist-trappings of actually consuming food here.", "author": "Tony L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-12-02", "description": "Great local place for traditional American diner food and FABULOUS cheesecake. Come here to experience local Brooklyn!\n\nI love the traditional 70's style burnt orange and mustard yellow colors; they have maintained and kept in shape their original diner furniture and it's like a ballast to the past.\n\nThe restaurant size is huge especially for New York real estate, allowing them to serve many customers. Service is quick and friendly, making it a joy to visit. \n\nPrices for food is extremely reasonable. We got the chicken tenders appetizer which was probably about a pound and a half of fresh fried chicken breast for about $15! I loved the Mazzeo ball soup too: great on a rainy, gloomy day. \n\nKnown for their cheesecake, there are over a dozen types to choose from. I can't say I've had cheesecake quite like it before. There is something unique and amazing to its taste! Perfectly baked with amazing texture too. \n\nIf you have never been here, it's a must!", "author": "Tiffany P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-03-01", "description": "I came in for an omelette one day and the entire experience was average at best, from the food to the service.

I would order a cheesecake to go on random occasions but this time I met up with a friend for drinks. I never even walked all the way inside the restaurant. Sad to say since I'm a Brooklyn native. The bartender was hilarious and friendly. I think his name was Tim, but I could be wrong. I'm pretty bad with names. Anyway, the drinks were strong, the company was good, and the hot wings were tasty. I like my wings pretty mild and it was nice. They had the blue cheese dip and the hot sauce on the side for dipping. The wings weren't pre-tossed. I wish there was a bit more celery. I love the celery but there were only 2 measly sticks. Boo! I also had the buffalo shrimp which was actually coated in the spicy buffalo sauce. It was good but pretty typical. Tasty but nothing special. Just good bar food/appetizer. Again, only with 2 sticks of celery. I know what you're thinking. I feel the judgement as you read this. Who cares about the celery? I do! It's great for groups big or small. This is where New York natives, tourists, and families on vacations come together and meet.

A Brooklyn institution - serving the best cheesecake in the world. Classic restaurant and bakery, serving all day breakfast. Friendly service and the food is amazing.

I'm sick of people saying for instance that Junior's cheesecake can be labeled as Junior's apple pie. That the only reason we call it cake is because society deemed it cake. Well, yeah. Let's move on to better things. Let's rejoice in sincerity. \n\nI want to be spoon-fed this cake on a beach in Los Angeles. Why I have to eat it in grey Brooklyn is because God has made it so that I shall never be content. I'm a pocket square dandy in a world of hobo chic. I suffer with cheesecake. I cry with with strawberry topping. \n\nI weep for churches and spires and old Brooklyn. Junior's is across from the train station. I used to visit my best friend here and we no longer talk because of politics, and how sad is that? Surely, that colors my experience of cheesecake. \n\nBut no matter how subjectively I deem the cheesecake, it remains what it is.  A very old recipe by a time-tested restaurant. The kind of place that serves tea in a metal pot, which I always forget to place my tea bag in. In the ceramic mug is less efficient, of course. \n\nI'd come here again, but only after the PTSD of studying art in New York wanes. Fact is, no one reads anymore. But they still go to Junior's. No one paints but still eats at Junior's, takes the train. We don't type but we stick our thumbs in cheesecake. I have many things to look forward to in New York. A spontaneous hand-holding maybe outside the DeKalb stop. I lament for whipped cream. I cannot look at anything objectively. This iconic diner, no less. I digress. \n\nIt may be best to stay faithful to classic.

Staff member passing does a double take, comes over, wraps ONE arm around my waist and with a squeeze whispered I love your look..I belligerently shoved his hand away and said in the meanest of tones. Don't you ever touch me again!\nInstead of apologizing, he made excuses like \n\"I was only paying you a compliment\", \n\"What's wrong with you?\" etc etc.  \nIt would have been BAD had he touched my hair but he touched my BODY, he touched my fat! I am typing this and I'm mad all over again! \nI paid my bill and left. I couldn't sit there to eat with that beast walking about. \n\nWould he have done the same thing had I been sitting there with a man because he \"liked my look\"? Would he have done this with anyone else? I'm I SO approachable? \nWhy did he take God out his thoughts and thought touching me (or any stranger) like that was okay???? Not even a pat on the shoulder (not that I'd like that either). I don't like strangers in my personal space.  \n\nHey you, if you're reading this, it's NEVER OKAY TO TOUCH SOMEONE WITHOUT THEIR INVITATION/consent!!!!

Come hungry because portions are gargantuan. Our group of 6 stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for cocktails and dessert (don't judge), and we were seated right away under an array of Brooklyn and New York memorabilia. Our waitress was genuinely kind and took care of us like family. \"Sure thing, honey\" and \"you got it, baby\" remarks were endearing and provided well-rounded customer service.\n\nWe ordered 3 different desserts each split between 2 people, and each was better than the next. For a classic cheesecake, The Original Cheesecake is a sure crowd pleaser. The Carrot Cake Cheesecake was the best of both worlds combining two iconic desserts into delicious bite after bite. If you're looking for complete indulgence, the star of the show was The \"One-and-Only\" New Yorker Cake Shake - a strawberry milkshake topped with a fatty slice of strawberry cheesecake. This thing was so ridiculous, it even came with a cheesecake rim.
