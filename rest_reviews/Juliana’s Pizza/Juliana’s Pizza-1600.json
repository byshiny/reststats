I had been to Grimaldi's just a handful of times - can't say how many of those were before/after it was sold, but Juliana's taste is right up there is my best Grimaldi's experience.

We tried two pies: the margarita with housemade mozzarella and the No. 1 House Special (Housemade mozzarella, Scamorza affumicata, pancetta, scallions and truffle oil--no tomato.)  Both were perfection.  Perfect leoparding char on the bottom crust, and totally balanced with the top-cooking.  \n\nWe showed up on a Monday around noon and got a seat promptly, as a party of two.  But the place was basically full at the time, and there was soon a line.  So the word is out that this place is the genuine Grimaldi's, I guess.  Juliana herself, Patsy's wife, was there and managing operations pretty closely.  She seemed to inspect every pizza and even did the cutting at times as they were on their way out.  She talked with us twice to ensure that all was well with the food.  Can't ask for more.\n\nOne of many things that makes me envy those who live in the NYC area.  I just get to look forward to a next visit.", "author": "David T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-17", "description": "One of the most amazing Pizza's you will have in Brooklyn...

Not greasy, perfect thin crust, excellent sauce. We got the margarita, it was amazing. Small was perfect for two people.

I m from LA so the price here is a bit pricey for me. It tastes good, no doubt about it. But i don't like a feeling that the bread gets thicker and thicker from the center to the crust. The service is slow, even i had during Thursday afternoon.

We ordered several pies 'to go' for a group - traditional margarita, one with sausage and pepperoni, and the white pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe. The sausage and broccoli rabe was most people's least favorite. I guess when you think of pizza you usually want that red sauce on it! There wasn't a lot of flavor on this one otherwise. Thanks for the head's up about the wax bags instead of boxes fellow yelper! The pizza made it to our destination ok, but not the most convenient way to carry 4 pies! Definitely give yourself time - I called ahead and my pies were ready 55 minutes later (or 10 minutes longer then they said).", "author": "Gena W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-14", "description": "Came here on a Friday evening around 8ish with a party of 3 and we got a nice corner table facing the rest of the restaurant (love that French-ish style of sitting).  \n\nWe had 1 large #1 pizza special and 1 small Margherita pizza-more than enough for 3 people. Both pizzas were delicious and we couldnt help but shovel it all down. Probably could have stopped after 3 slices but NOPE-had 4 and a half..\nThe pancetta on the #1 Pizza special tasted so good and the scallions were an interesting and unexpected touch to the slice. If I make it back to brooklyn heights I probably want to try the pizza with salmon on it-quite a unique take on pizza toppings there.\n\nThe only issue was having them split the check and also not allowing for any modifications on the pizza (my friend is a vegetarian so we wanted to take off the pancetta from half the pizza).

Nice refreshing IPA beer as well.... \n\nIt's popularity deducts from the experience as it is perpetually packed, somewhat hectic and less atmospheric than some other old school NYC pizza joints that ooze with character, as well as melting cheese....... \n\nBut delicious nonetheless...", "author": "Dominick B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-09", "description": "So... When I got off the subway at Clark St, a kitten-sized rat scurried across the platform about three feet in front of me. Definite freak out, minus the girly screaming. We walked over to Juliana's and hopped in line, shaking our heads at the poor, deluded tourists queued up at Grimaldi's next door. The wait was a bit long, but it was a Saturday night around 7, so it was to be expected. \n\nVerdict- the pizza was definitely worth the scare and the wait. I had a margherita pizza with roasted red peppers. The sauce was incredible. My only complaint is that the crust had been stretched too thin, leaving a hole. Patsy would have kicked it back for that. But all in all, a good pie. The rest of the group had a white pizza with olives, peppers and anchovies and another margherita with red peppers, pepperoni and mushrooms.

Handpicked by my 7yr old cousin who was caving pizza.  We were immediately greeted by a mature, friendly host in a family-styled space.  Juliana's dining crowd is tab loud for my liking.  Our server ,Monica, was kid-friendly and engaging.  Since Mr. 7 yr old has simple tastebuds, our server offered us 1/2 Margherita \u0026 1/2 Marinara pizza - it was perfect \u0026 the best of both worlds.

I ordered the furthest thing from pizza with a basil pizza, which had olive oil, basil, tomatoes, and a very light cheese. The flavors were perfectly combined to create an intensely satisfying slice with every bite. The staff was friendly and punctual, especially the man running the show himself.
