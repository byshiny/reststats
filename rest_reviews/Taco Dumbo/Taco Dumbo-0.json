Firstly Taco Dumbo has awesome 5 dollar happy hour margarita. Ask the waitress what to get and they give you good tips. Points for the taco food bar, bathroom, outlets and comfy chairs. Oh and the music is groovy, \"throw in some bling.\" I was almost rocking it out like I was in Hawaii or really close \n\nI think you'll like it.", "author": "Alina W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-29", "description": "For starters, this place DOES NOT take cash, so make sure you have a card! The overall vibe of this place is super chic, hip and updated (even the bathroom)! So if you're anything like this generation, Taco Dumbo def offers a spot for the Instagram lovers, LOL. I just think that after you get over the great decor, the tacos and what's offered is just \"OKAY\". There was nothing that really wowed me - oh, expect the margarita which was GREAT! \n\nThe tacos were way too small and lacked a lot of flavors. I also didn't really enjoy the impossible taco meat nachos.", "author": "Amber B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2019-05-06", "description": "It didn't seem like my name was getting called anytime soon on the day I had jury duty, so I started looking up lunch spots nearby. That's when I found Taco Dumbo, which is a ten-minute walk away from the courthouse. \n\nTo be honest, I probably wouldn't have ordered from here if there wasn't $5 off deal via the Ritual app. The tacos are pretty pricey, starting at $5 each. I had the Spicy Tuna, the Rotisserie Chicken 'Tinga' taco, and the Vegan Chorizo taco. I liked the concept of the spicy tuna taco. It's like a sushi-ritto but in taco form with brown rice, so you have to eat it quick because the seaweed will get soggy really fast. I don't know how I felt about the fish. It had an odd color to it, but it tasted fine - I'm just not sure if it was actually tuna. The chicken was not bad. I ordered it on a lettuce jicama wrap, because I was trying to be *a bit* healthier, but they gave me a corn tortilla anyway. I'm kind of glad they did because I was still a little hungry after the three, tacos, so I would have been even hungrier if it was the lettuce wrap. The vegan chorizo was my favorite, which I was surprised at since I normally don't order vegan things. Maybe it was the lime crema that got me. \n\nLike I mentioned earlier, Taco Dumbo is expensive without the coupon. I'm also never in this area, so I don't see myself making a return trip.\n\nTip - I saw a sign for taco Tuesdays: $1 per taco from 5-7, but each person can only get 2 tacos.", "author": "Mel T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-05-02", "description": "There's NOTHING bad to say about this place. \n\nDECOR: 10/10 tropical, chic, and girly \n\nMUSIC/AMBIANCE: 10/10 loud but mellow and played good vibe music \n\nFOOD: 10/10 both vegan and non vegan options\n\nSERVICE: 10/10 ordering was easy, food came out quickly and the staff was very sweet! \n\nCLEANLINESS: 9/10 everything was served on compostable trays with bio-based utensils.

Yes I am.  That's the rating you get when the vegan Impossible Tacos and Vegan Chorizo Taco are just about dead solid perfect.  Paired with a delightful $5 Frozen Margarita Taco Dumbo really hit the spot on a sunny Sunday afternoon.

The weekday Happy Hour 5-7 has some great deals. It does tend to get crowded then, which adds a significant wait time. \n\nWe loved the blue corn chips and the fresh guacamole! The nachos were alright, but I didn't love the vegan cheese or meat that much. Texture was good but taste was not the best. \n\nThe margaritas are definitely where it's at. You can customize your choice of cold-pressed juice blends (pineapple, watermelon lime, strawberry apple) + hard alcohol (tequila, gin, mezcal, etc) + salt or sugar for the rim (my favorite was the rose sugar and hibiscus sugar)! \n\nThe only big down is that drinks took about 10-20 min to make during HH and one of my friends drinks took 45 min! However, it was during an extremely busy time, in the midst of HH.", "author": "Jennifer D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-03-20", "description": "Nice place.  Looks like a pretty extensive bar with lots of margarita type options but see whiskey, brandy, vodka etc.  Decent beer selection.  Few NY brews that are above the expected Mexican beers.\n\nI had two tacos and guacamole.  I liked everything.  Tacos had good flavor.  I had \"The Impossible Taco\" which is plant based beef.  Tasted like real beef.  I'm a meat lover.  I would have this one again.  I also had beef short-rib taco which was also tasty.   Guac was fresh but didn't really stand out.  Had corn and fried chicken skins with guac. corn tasted fresh, next time I'll skip the skins.\n\nThey have a happy hour food and drink menu.

It was super yummy with the hot sauce as suggested! Yum! It's a little pricey, $6 for one taco, no sides.... but overall great concept and flavor! Additionally I bought a \"Dirty Lemon\" drink (health drink) - got the Chromium one... and it was $10!! Lol that was pricey, but I'm not sure what they usually run, so maybe that's normal.

When you enter, you notice there is a lot of open space and a large \"Vibe is Tribe\" neon sign. There's a bar straight ahead when you first enter and tons of seating.\n \nI ordered the Rice Bowl with sushi grade salmon while one of my friends ordered the Taco Salad with Pulled Rotisserie Chicken. My two other friends got their rotisserie chicken tinga, tamarind-braised beef short-rib, and impossible tacos. The cashier was actually kind enough to give my friend, who is a vegetarian, a free taco (their Vegan Chorizo) to try.\n \nOnce you order, you can choose a place to sit and they will call your name for you to pick up your order. We weren't there during the lunch rush, but I imagine this could get a little disorganized if the restaurant is loud or if someone isn't paying attention. There were also three pitchers of cucumber water and glasses that you were welcomed to take and drink out of.\n \nThe Rice Bowl reminded very much of a Pok\u00e9 Bowl that you might try at a sushi place. It was delicious and very filling as all the ingredients seemed to compliment and mix well with each other. The Taco Salad was also very good and healthy as well. While, I did not try any of the tacos my friends order, they both told me that they were delicious and filling.\n \nThis was place was great and the foods were nutritious, well-presented, and affordable to us.

The wild salmon taco meal with pineapple press juice was the wave... ask anybody! The food came out promptly and with a smile (did I mention I LOVE great service?). As I sat there and looked at my sushi style taco, I thought to myself \"are they gonna judge me if I roll it all into a ball and ..... bruh just eat it.\" So I did, and it was gooooooood. The seaweed held together better that expected and the salmon was flavorful and fresh. Apparently if you press pineapple just you create magic in a cup.... Next time I'll get a bigger cup lol.\nFor a moment I had to break my own \"don't eat and drink simultaneously rule\" but I couldn't help myself. You'd think one would overpower the other right?
