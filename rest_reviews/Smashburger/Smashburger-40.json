My first time having Smashburger and I wasn't disappointed. Made some last minute plans with a friend because I was craving a burger, decided to go here instead of Shake Shack. The set up kinda reminds me of an upgraded Five Guys and the presentation of burgers reminds me of Red Robin? Anyway, good amount of seating and good service all around. It makes sense to have them bring the food to you instead of having everyone standing around waiting for it. \n\nMy friend ordered the truffle mushroom Swiss with a side of smash sweet potato fries and I ordered the New Yorker with a side of fried pickles. We shared our burgers and sides, yum! Everything was flavored just right and I was pretty happy with the fried pickles! I would've ordered a shake since I heard so many good things about it, but it was too much after the amount of food and sugar I had for the day... Smashburger is a good option to satisfy a burger craving and I will have to go back for a shake!", "author": "Geekar L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-18", "description": "Why don't I go to Smashburger more often?  It's so good!  Every single time I go I end up having a stellar meal.\n\nPopped in just last week for a bite while running errands.  While I planned to come earlier I didn't arrive until 1pm and the line was already 8 or 10 people deep (probably thanks to the college across the street?)  It moved quickly thought and the gal at the cash register was super sweet.  She was quick to remind me the difference between the regular (5oz) and the big burger (7oz) and even applied a $2 off coupon when I mentioned an email I had gotten recently.*\n\nFor less than $10 (including coupon) I had a 'Create Your Own' Burger - 7oz + Pretzel Bun + BBQ + Lettuce + Pickles + Goat Cheese + Bacon AND a regular order of the smash fries.\n\nThe burger itself was fantastic.  Smashed to perfection with a super soft bun.  I LOVE that I can totally customize my burger and all of the good ingredients aren't an upcharge.  Most places would charge extra for that pretzel bun!  They could have spared a little bit more cheese on my burger (I did order a 'big' after all...) but that's really the only negative I've got towards that burger.\n\nThe smash fries are a must order as far as I'm concerned- thin cut fried tossed in olive oil, rosemary and garlic.  Oh my deliciousness!  The regular size is a nice big portion and they are not polite when it comes to that garlic rosemary combo.  So so good!\n\nFor lunch I asked for a water cup but I've had their milkshakes before - and if you're wondering if you should order one - you should!  They're spectacular.  **\n\nFood came out quickly and piping hot.  And the staff wandered around often to clear baskets and ask if anyone needed anything.  \n\nThey really know what they're doing over there at Smashburger!  Gosh, I really need to eat there more often... \n\n\n*Sign up for their email club - they send out coupons for discounts and free sides.\n** Must also point out that the drink machine at SB has Vitamin Water XXX.  As someone who doesn't love soda... this is a nice surprise!  Why don't more fastfood/semifastfood places offer Vitamin Water via the soda fountain!?", "author": "Alyssa R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-27", "description": "I was craving for a chicken sandwich so I decided to stop by Smashburger to get their Avocado Grilled Chicken with sweet potato fries. The line went pretty quickly and I waited maybe 5 minutes for my meal, which explains why my food looked the way it did. \n\nMy chicken sandwich was all over the place with sauce dripping everywhere making the bun soggy and impossible not to get it all over your face. Plus my avocado was cut into pieces and also soggy along with the tomatoes. Overall, the sandwich was sloppy as if they literally SMASHED the ingredients together. \n\nI'll more likely order again, but on a day that I know the cooks aren't so busy so that my next burger or sandwich look like the picture on the menu.", "author": "Tanya A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-11-22", "description": "So I went yesterday once again, the service was no different then my last experience. As a matter of fact the food took so long for me to get. And those onion stacks that I ordered were soooo horrible and mushy instead of crispy .... Fries were cold. But my food took so long? I just couldn't understand \n\nThe service just isn't great to me at all, I won't be a returning customer at all. I'd rather go to another burger joint.", "author": "Samantha B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-03-04", "description": "Greeting - friendly\nVibe- after school madhouse\nBR- Fail\nService- good\nParking- paid lot or meters \nPrice- $9 burgers $3 fries\nFood\nBrooklyn burger was dry as a bone.

Today, I ventures out to try a new burger spot and so I passed in my usual 67-69 burger, whatever you call it. Lol - I crack myself up!! \n\nWell, anyway, I did what I normally do and I YELP it and came across Smash Burger. YELP never fails. I'll just add that I'm not a big beef eater. In fact, I turned this experience into my once a year (intentional beef eating experience) beef day. Long story made shot, I love my Blue Cheese crumb Buffalo Hot Sauce Burger. My date had the Jalapeno burger. At some point between sipping down our delicious milkshakes and chomping down on our burgers, we bothered smiled and gave each other a high five which translates into my 4 STARS!!", "author": "Percy H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-31", "description": "Yesterday, I went here on a date (which was an epic fail, but that's not the fault of this restaurant). This is a hybrid fast food restaurant and sit-down restaurant. You pay at the counter, they give you a number, and then you sit down. When your meal is ready, they'll bring it to your table.  \n\nThey essentially serve a variety of burgers and chicken sandwiches, as well as desserts. They also sell booze. The food took about 5 minutes to arrive. I had the crispy chicken sandwich and it hit the spot. It was much better than that sorry excuse of a restaurant known as KFC.\n\nThis restaurant is quite possibly the cleanest restaurant that I've ever been to. Furthermore, all of the staff members were polite. I also enjoyed the music that they played in the background. The only caveats are that it's borderline expensive (the chicken sandwich cost $7) and that this is a relatively small restaurant. And oddly enough, this restaurant is 3 blocks away from the high school that I attended (those 4 years weren't exactly pleasant).", "author": "L.

The food was awesome! It definitely rivaled some of our West Coast favorites, like In n Out. Yes, it was pricey for burgers, the bathroom line was long and slow, but the food was delicious and there was plenty of seating, indoors and outside. I would definitely recommend it!  The pros outweighed the cons...a lot.

Until today,when i walked in and had to use the restroom real fast before i sat down... So i walked toward the bathroom and this over aggressive belligerent employee basically blocked my path and said you have to purchase something 1st.\n\n I told him im a regular and i never had this problem before. Maybe i should of told him im a diabetic. But i\u00a0didn't\u00a0think it was any of his business.So\u00a0after he explained that he has had a rash of\u00a0undesirables\u00a0coming in and using the restroom and not purchasing\u00a0anything. I felt exactly like one of those people he mentioned instead of a loyal customer.Then he finally said go ahead use the bathroom.

There was only two people in front of me but for some reason the service was very slow. It was finally my turn to order. I was looking forward to a Smashburger shake but the gentleman told me that there's no more shakes at this time and I was confused because I just saw the young lady make two shakes for her friends and she had this big ass ugly smile on her face when he told me that there was no shakes at this time. I looked at the time and it wasn't even 9:30 and the restaurant closes at 10 and there's no sign saying no shakes after a certain time, she just didn't want to do it. I didn't want to cause a scene over a shake so I just ordered a fountain drink and I made my order to stay. I was looking for a table to eat at and all of the tables were filthy I had to wipe a table down myself. So to sum it all up,the service was slow, the girl didn't want to make my shake and the place was dirty. I will not return to this location.
