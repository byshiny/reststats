At first it looked cute and  like there could be goodness around!\n\nBut noooo, first we sat down on the sticky seats with sticky menus. 10mins later we get water with what looked like mayo floating in it gross, this was mere foreshadowing!\n\n10 more mins n they take our order.\n\n30 more mins and we get our food.I never knew that it took 30mins to make a salad And a chicken wrap with fries! When I wait almost an hour n put up with ppls crap and mayo flavored water, I expect the food to at lest be foodlike and yummy. My wrap was cold, and they charged me a dollar for a side dallop of there famous BBQ sauce. My mom's chicken salad , was plain lettuce with a uncut slab of grilled chicken in the center!\n\nMind you it was 4pm, the place was practically empty, no reason for such a wait. The real problem was the staff, they joked, and chased each other, basically hung out, as my food got cold in the back. I'll all for fun on the job, but when people  who didn't even work there where hanging out in the kitchen, that where the line gets drawn.\n\nI can really go on and on, about how much this place sucked, but im just gonna end it here.

As an appetizer I ordered Buffalo wings and my friend ordered the Thai wings (which was a favorite of our waiter) and French fries. My wings were \"so so\" but my friend was really under whelmed. My friend expressed his lack of satisfaction for the wings which were our waiters \"favorite\" and the waiter wasn't even kind enough to change the order or take it off our bill. For my entr\u00e9e I had bacon cheese burger w/ potato wedges. The burger was \"A-OK\" but the potato wedges was \"AS GOOD AS IT GETS\".

I could accomplish so much within 3 hours of waiting. One of the waitress was giving my table an attitude, simply asked for a refill on Sprite...never came back with it and talked to us as if it never happened with a bad attitude. Cannot believe one cup of beer would cost me $7.25 and the prices weren't exactly on the menu. Nothing special about a cup of Guiness and a Hard Cider going for $7.25 a cup while everywhere else is about $5 tops. $.60 per wing, it better make me feel young because Croxley Ales wings are only $.10- $.20 per wing so they have some competition. In terms of flavor the chicken wing is just all pure sauce, its the sauce that makes you get sick of eating the wings as time goes by. They definitely drenched the chicken wings in sauce only for quite some time. Blazin' hot wings wasn't that hot, probably wouldn't come back again overall.

I had been jonesing for a big plate of wings for a couple of weeks and not being a local resident I figured this would be the best bet considering that I hadn't done any serious wing research before my trip. I wasn't there to eat a sandwich or give a single french fry any real estate in my tummy. I was here to conduct serious wingness and no other item on the menu would come between me and my mission.\n\nOur server was pretty good and she came back to our table a couple of times after we got our dishes. I got the plain wings with a side of hot bbq sauce because I have a hard time with committing to a sauce. It proved to be a good idea because the hotter sauces might not be a good idea when you're trying to scarf down a huge plate of wings and don't have the tolerance for constant hotness.\n\nAfter 18 wings I was picking off whatever strands of chicken I may have missed in my frenzy. The flavor was about average and the wings were a good proportion. I've had some pretty sickly looking wings before and these were in good shape. Goes great with a wheat beer too.\n\nThis is a good place to go if you just want some quick and delicious wings. The variety of sauces makes it even better.", "author": "Raphael D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-10", "description": "I went on Saturday November,10,2012,I went to get some wings to take out,they told me my wait would be 20minutes ,so I decided to go to the bar ,ordered me a jack and coke,I really liked the way the bartender made my drink so I decided,I wanted to be seated near the bar in these high tables,I ask one of the gentleman in black can I just sit ,he told me no,I needed to be seated,so I went over to the girl who was sitting people and ask can I sit in the high tables and wait on my order and have some drinks she told me no,the tables was only for people who order in ,and she said I can wait over by the bar,which I didn't want to do,that's why I ask can I sit in the high tables,then another girl came over to me who worked there she  told me I couldn t be aide the tables belong to the waiters and if I got a drink from the bar most people don't tip the waiters be aide I already got the drink from the bar,so I just said ok ,with my eyes crossed and a little annoyed,I stayed there for three more drinks,I had got my order from the check out desk and watched college football while drinking and by the way I tipped the bartender for each drink I had,because that's how I roll,I ate my honey barbecue wings at home they wasn't that good,the wings was tough,and the honey barbecue sauce wasn't that good,,I will go back for a drunk because they was good and not watered down ,", "author": "Monique B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-15", "description": "I really am not a fan of this place...but my kid loves the honey bbq wings and they have great beer options on tap.
