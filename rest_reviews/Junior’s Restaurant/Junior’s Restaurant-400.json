Aside from the famous cheesecake, I also remembered how much I enjoyed the mini Danish that were always set on everyone's table. And so, I decided to have breakfast there.\nThe exterior and interior seemed virtually unchanged. However, the prices were definitely 2016!\nI looked at the breakfast prices and they were comparable to a trendy brunch spot---but wait, I thought--- isn't this a diner?!?!? \nI ordered the 2 eggs any style (over medium). That's it. Ten bucks.  To be fair, it came with a small juice, coffee/tea, and the choice of either grits, home fries, French fries or toast. However, should you desire meat as in bacon or ham to accompany your eggs,  expect the price to shoot up to about $15. Typically, 2 eggs any style with toast should not be more than $5.50.\nA few minutes later, the mini Danish arrived followed by my 2 eggs over medium with grits.\nIt was average at best. The eggs were tiny and the grits were bland.\nApart from the 5 star cheesecake (which can be purchased at many places), I don't really have a reason to frequent Junior's. And I'm rarely in the neighborhood.\nBut the walk down memory lane and remembering my youth \u0026 loved ones merits 5 stars.", "author": "Johanna B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-27", "description": "We catered holiday office dinner for 14.   When I walked in to pick up the order I had to talk to 2 different staff and they are just so rude beyond what you expect. As I wait for MANAGER I can't help notice how dirty place looked.

It was my 30th birthday and I was in a dark place...ready to trade my two year old for a crack-cake. Fast forward to Spring Break 2016 and she's almost six. We're both addicts now. She's been to the one in Times Square and Grand Central, but I told her that we had to go back to Cheesecake Mecca. \n\nThey didn't disappoint. What can I say that I haven't already said? Same ingredients: sugar, cream cheese, crack. We argued over which cheesecake to get. I won because I have a job and keys to the car. We sat in complete silence and let our eyes gloss over. Then we left. \n\nThe sugar rush is real. Giving cheesecake to a five year old is like giving cocaine to a gremlin. She ran across the Brooklyn Bridge all the way to the WTC...then asked if we could get another slice from the one in Times Square. That's why I love her...codependent and enabling.", "author": "Ordale A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-12", "description": "About 3 of us visited after a night on the town in Manhattan.

A lot of sandwich options. A lot of deserts (which I do want to go back and try. That is what they are known for I guess) Food was okay. Nothing special. They offer iced coffee and other drinks you wouldn't normally see on a menu. So, the variety on the menu is great. But to me, it didn't taste like anything spectacular. It was just okay. There seemed like there were some great servers, but ours took forever, he left us waiting for 20 minutes before taking our drink order. Then another 15 minutes for the drinks to come out. The server in the next section over was annoyed with him, as was I.

The dining area is always clean, the staff is always friendly, and the food is decent. Breakfast, lunch, whatever it's all good. But the cheesecakes on the other hand. Every single bite I eat tastes like heaven on a fork. Sure it's a tourist trap, but is it like Times Square? Hell no. This place is not overcrowded nor is it overpriced in my opinion. \n\nIf you are a tourist just remember one thing, don't think about it. Go inside, and buy yourself that God damn cheesecake already.

I had an all access ticket, which means you get almost unlimited food.  I ordered 2 twin sandwiches, 2 black and white cookies, a water and 2 animal crackers.  With each ticket swipe (you get 6) you can get a drink, a snack, a dessert, and a entr\u00e9e.  I noticed that this women was swiping my card over and over again (like 3 or 4 times) and I said something.  She explained that she could only do what I had said above (limited amount for each swipe) and that she needed to swipe it that many times.  She could have swiped only twice, but swiped it 4 times.  I don't know if she was counting the animal crackers as a dessert or something.  I didn't want argue with her as there was a long line of people forming.  It was halftime.  She brought my over my food and there was only one twin sandwich.  I said that I ordered 2 and she agreed but said she forgot to put it on.  She said she would ring one up and asked my for my all access ticket again.  This would have been my 4th or 5th swipe used at the same location.  She could have done it in 2.  I wanted to try other places as this was a cool experience.  I went to another spot and ordered what I wanted with no issues or troubles.  I went to another spot and was told I was out of swipes.  This is crazy because I should have been able to get 6 entrees and now I am out of swipes having only tried 2 spots.  I give Juniors 2 stars.  The food is really good.  The black and white cookies are some of the best around period.  The employee was horrible.  When she admitted it was her fault for not remembering to add the sandwich to the swipe she should have given it to me without any issues.  You wanted to swipe again (5 of my 6- I felt like I was being bullied by her).  I feel like often these employees like to flex power over costumers.  This whole debacle definatly made my experince at Junior's and at the game in general was worse then it should have been.  I was excited to hit up one more game and all access ticket before the season ended but this was beat.  I hope that Juniors and Barclays trains their employees to be more competent (to do a proper job) and treat people better then they do (show some respect, have manners).

We only came for cheesecake but we ended up splitting a BLT, (huge and delicious), but the principal of this show was the cheesecake. It was as great as ever. The big surprise was the coffee. I remember the drip coffee from back in the day and this didn't taste anything like that. This was amazing coffee. I asked Don about the coffee, and to my surprise he told me that Junior's served La Colombe coffee. What? Only the most amazing coffee in the world.

He was patient and suggested many things that sound appetizing. I opted for a burger, cooked perfectly. My friends both enjoyed their meals, one having jerk chicken the other a BBQ chicken entree. The prices were comparable to other establishments in the area - not too overpriced. The drinks and food quality were awesome...the service was definitely the added cherry on top.\n\nThe second visit the next day was due to guilt - like who comes to Juniors and not have cheesecake?! We can in for a morning cocktail and ordered the red velvet, carrot and strawberry cheesecake all which were huge portions but also VERY good.\n\nThe historic business is classic in appearance on both the outside and the inside. You can tell the era it was built and how things haven't much changed.....I think its the charm.

So I give it a three but if you are a first time visitor to NYC, you have to go regardless.  Juniors is iconic.  The Juniors in Brooklyn is the original and the one you should go to but if you are pressed for time, there is a Juniors in Times Square and one in Grand Central.  But it's not quite the same thing.  \nThe cheesecake is good.  The desserts in general are good.  Lots of variety and the serving sizes are healthy.  (And by healthy, I mean large.  So I guess that would kind of not be healthy.  But life is short.)  \nThe desserts are a great value, especially for NYC prices.  The food though is mediocre.  I think they simply figure they can capitalize on their iconic cheesecake.  Have a quick sandwich if you must.  Otherwise grab your dessert and go.  Grab two.  Heck.  It's Brooklyn.  Grab three and fuhgeddaboutit.", "author": "Thad K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-21", "description": "I've heard so many great things about Junior's cheesecakes and thankfully I live a few minutes away.\n\nI've tried the mini ones you can find at grocery stores, but I knew I had to try a legitimate slice.  The strawberry cheesecake was good but it wasn't amazing. The crust was similar to pie crust, which isn't what I was expecting. And the cake itself was way too dense. \n\nIf you're in the mood for cheesecake, I definitely recommend Junior's but I've tried better (surprisingly at typical NJ diners). \n\nI really like the atmosphere, nonetheless.
