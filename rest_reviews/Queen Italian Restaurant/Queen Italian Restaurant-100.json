When they came to visit from Florida, we ate here three nights in a row. It's that good.\n\nIt might be crowded when you get there, so reservations are a plus. One night we had to wait around half an hour, but they take care of you at the bar. An adorable, tiny, old Italian man will seat you at a traditional white tablecloth and you'll be given a variety of Italian breads with amazing olive oil.\n\nThe food was all delicious. Throughout our three nights we had squid ink pasta, linguine, risotto, scallops, lasagne, and a number of desserts. Everything was comforting, tasty, and great quality for the price. It's not the best of the best, but they stay in their lane. \n\nDecor is a bit cheesy, so I wouldn't personally recommend taking a date here, but if that's your thing, go for it. Get a wine with the meal and enjoy.", "author": "Erika L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-10", "description": "An old landmark in this neighborhood only gets better with age, need more like this one!\nI tried something new to me which was a most delicious and delicate entree. Highly recommend the baked veal scallopine with baby eggplant, the best tomato sauce and covered with perfectly melted  fontina cheese. For dessert I had the best ricotta cheesecake ever, light but with the balance of cheese curds and just the perfect balance of orange citrus.

We had reservations and still had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. We sat at the bar and ordered some wine while we waited. The wine was fabulous, I must say. We ordered a bottle of the Multipulciano (the one with the grape vine attached to the bottle.) The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nAfter we sat down, I don't think our server said more than two words to us. When he came to take our order he just stood there with his pad open without saying a word.\n\nI ordered the veal parmesan and my boyfriend ordered the chicken parmesan. They were huge portions which would have been great if they tasted good. Both dishes were overly breaded with the breading falling off in sheets when you picked up a bite. The chicken itself was fine but I cannot say the same for the veal. The veal was very very chewy which wasn't very appetizing. The saving grace was the side of penne. The penne was al dente and delicious.\n\nIf I was to go back, as this place was highly recommended and I can tell by this page many people like it, I would only get a pasta dish.\n\nOverall, this place is way overpriced for a mediocre meal.", "author": "Rachel B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-13", "description": "This place sits undercover on a typical busy Brooklyn street with electronic stores and fast food joints.  In fact its next door neighbor is Popeye's Chicken.  But don't let that deter you.  Inside is a tranquil oasis from the city.  The decor is a typical traditional Italian joint, somewhat dimly lit with white \"christmas\" lights and some cheesy decor.  But it's also filled with full and happy diners.  The crowd seemed to be an older crowd.  Many tables of 4 or more.  And the night I was there there was a famous boxer and trainer eating in the restaurant.  That caused slight commotion with a number of people asking for pictures and autographs.  \n\nThe food was very good.  I had the \"Gnocchi Casalinga - Sauce Of Braised Veal \u0026 Assorted Peppers\".  It was fabulous, but got a bit rich near the end and I couldn't finish it.  Part of that reason could also have been the feast of various breads and oil I was served while I waited for dinner.  There was at least 6 or 7 varieties of bread - hard and soft.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed the conversation and service of the Honduran bartender.  I didn't get his name but he is a super good guy.

It didn't disappoint. The best Italian food is in Brooklyn. To start, they bring a bread sampler and garlic/minced olive/olive oil dip.

Host would come and ask you how you like your food, and decor is very much white table clothed.  I loved my seafood linguine, and the fresh mozzarella cheese was so good!

Came here with my dad and boyfriend and the experience couldn't have been better - I grew up with Italian food EVERYWHERE in my house (my grandmother is a Brooklyn Italian).

My Dad was a physician  and one one the owners was his patient as was a waiter. I dined there at least once a week for years. When I went to college my folks ate there at least once a week for almost three decades. Whenever I came home it was my go to place. \n\nI've lived in the mid-west since the late '70s and rarely returned to Brooklyn. Yesterday my wife and I tried to re-live history. At as respects Queen, it could not be done. We were not bothered by the gentrification. The dining room is quite attractive. But the rest--ug!!! The greeter was at the same time rude and disinterested. When I told him of my history with Queen he was non plussed and  wouldn't ask the owner-whom I knew as a young man--to say hi. As for the food it was mediocre at best. The baked clams were clearly pre made and lacked any taste of the sea. The fried zucchini sticks were greasy and over salted. Our pastas can best be described as edible. No flair, nothing we cannot do better at home. \n\nThe service was passable but disconnected. When we asked for tobasco for our clams we were advised that they did not serve it. They serve tobasco with baked clams all over Italy. \n\nThe prices are New York for sure. $23-25 for a modest plate of pasta. \n\nOne cannot relive past treasures, I guess.", "author": "Harold H."}], "servesCuisine": "Italian", "priceRange": "$31-60", "name": "Queen Italian Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "84 Court St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7Yhhz938vfSN-DOeMA6sIw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17185965955"}
