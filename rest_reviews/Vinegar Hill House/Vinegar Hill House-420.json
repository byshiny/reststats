Many places have headed in this direction the past two years and few get it right.  Vinegar Hill House gets it fantastically right.  The food is phenomenal: fresh, organic and local as much as possible, high quality, made with love and integrity with a dash of creativity.  Their cast iron roast chicken is a return-repeat dish for any season.  Menu does change every season or even every couple of months.   Red Wattle pork chop is also a solid year-round hit.  Brook Trout in late summer was fantastic - crispy skin, moist and flaky flesh, lovely herbs and veggies.  Brunch is also terrific.

I was floored. The raviolis, which I ordered, were my favorite.

The wine was a bit over priced. It was good, but not fantaaaastic. \n\nThe ambience was easy going and warm. This place is small and cute, and its location on a couple stoned Hudson Street makes it even quaint. I would return here in a heart beat and wish to god they had something like it in San Francisco.

I felt like a proper heffer when we ordered, but after everything was served it seemed perfectly portioned. So, as mentioned in previous reviews the portions are not so large.\n\nAll of our dishes were delicious.  My friend who hates bacon (I know, right?) couldn't keep his paws off my side order it was so yummy. Our pancake with ricotta \u0026 banana was sinfully good.

The food is superb, although from the outside it is a downtrodden storefront. Inside, it's quaint, cuddly and offbeat.\n\nTo more important things - the food: it's imaginative, it's inspired, it's well-executed. Of particular interest are the appetizers. I had Manila clams, simmered in a curry flavored butter sauce and served with fried Middle Eastern bread. My hosts had a chicken liver mousse and aragula salad with very thinly sliced kumquats segments. Truly wonderful.\n\nThe main courses are also accomplished. Their signature dish is a tender, very finely prepared pork chop, served sliced with a bracing sauerkraut. My lady friend enjoyed a rabbit ragu served with papardella. I had the cast iron chicken. It was uniformly cooked with a crspy skin, supported by a vinegary sauce - nothing extraordinary, though. As an observation, there should be a choice vegetables either as part of the entrees or as side dishes. The restaurant is not exactly \"green\" friendly.\n\nWe shared the dessert - a spiced date cake with a scoop of sherbet. The Spanish wine, Priorat, was drinkable.

Listen closely, children:\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a beautiful neuroscientist princess living in a magical kingdom called DUMBO.  The princess liked DUMBO very much, but DUMBO's culinary offerings were limited, bland, and somewhat tourist-angled, and it made her sad because she loved nothing more in the whole world than going out to eat.  Especially if she didn't have to take the subway.  \n\nThen one day, it seemed the princess's prayers had been answered--a restaurant opened up within walking distance of her castle that promised to be just what she'd been hoping for--Vinegar Hill House.  Headed by a chef from a popular restaurant in a nearby kingdom, VHH offered a seasonal menu, classic cocktails, and a carefully curated mid-19th century decor.  People came from far and wide to dine at VHH, and they were creaming themselves.  \n\nThe princess was eager to try VHH, and repeatedly asked her handsome prince to go with her, but wary of the hype, this wise prince resisted her pleas time and again.  One rainy Sunday, however, the prince admitted that after having spent the weekend watching the entire first season of Dexter On Demand, the two of them could use a little air and a hot meal.  \n\nAnd so the incredibly good-looking couple strolled hand-in-hand over to VHH, where they were suddenly surrounded by plaid shirts and pork-pie hats.  They ordered cocktails and the scallop-bacon-leek tart, the latter arriving before the former, as the bartender was deeply involved in conversation with the patrons at the bar.  The prince and princess were not pleased, as they prefer to enjoy a few sips of an aperitif before eating.  \n\nFor entrees, the princess thought about ordering the Cast Iron Chicken, but changed her mind when she learned that it was literally just  $15 chicken, with no vegetables or starch of any kind (for this, one was required to order an $8 side).  She opted instead for the English Pea Ravioli, and there the evening went even more sour.  She was brought a plate with six ravioli that could not have been more than 1.5\" square and filled with what was almost certainly baby food.  There was no sauce--no butter, no olive oil, no moisture at all--just a few scattered peas and a sprinkling of parmesan.  \"Is this a joke?\" the prince wondered aloud.  Sadly, it was not.  His papardelle with rabbit ragu was somewhat tastier, but also came in an appetizer-sized portion at an entree-sized price ($15).  \n\nThe prince and princess left feeling duped but also amused.  Another hyped-up restaurant that the masses seem to be gushing about for no other reason than to appear in agreement with the hype.  As they began the walk back to their castle with half-full bellies, conversation turned to topping selection on the pizza that was about to be ordered, and they lived happily ever after, never to return to VHH again.\n\nThe End.", "author": "Becca S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-16", "description": "An exceptional meal. Leave room for cake. \n\nI though I'd had my fill of New Brooklyn Cuisine after the General Greene, which I think is way overrated. Vinegar Hill House is very much in the same mold, but the execution was much better. We had the sweet corn ravioli and braised short ribs for our main courses.

One of the most decadent things I've put in my mouth for a long time.

The first notable restaurant to open shop in this small, sleepy district, is tucked behind the unpainted door of a retired storefront and bookended by windows that fog up like the den of a Dickensian tenement. \n\nChef Jean Adamson, formerly of Freemans, has managed to recreate the atmosphere of her former employer: an intrepid journey to a little known speakeasy hiding on a forgotten New York City street.  (A speakeasy it is not; however, currently, Vinegar Hill House is BYOB as they await a liquor license.)  Diners enter through an unmarked and see a J-shaped bar--first--and, then further, an open kitchen on the left and smallish tables that hug the front walls and the remaining space.  A larger dining table (comprised of 2 or 3 tables) is the furthest any patron could be seated from the door, and it is where my fianc\u00e9, a friend and I enjoyed our meal.\n\nThe whole space is shrouded in yellowed walls and the backbar contains a deconstructed pipe organ that belies the winnowed pathos of unassuming, hipster chic.  A large, stainless steel woodburning (?) oven in the kitchen undercuts that attempt, but details such as a vintage American flag, antique bottles and stainless steel skillets leave their impression.  The space appears, intentionally, to have been resurrected from cruel and thoughtless abandonment, and the menu reads with the clarity of the New England Primer.\n\nThe New England Primer was an A to Z reader, however.  The brief menu at Vinegar Hill House is just an abbreviation of New American cuisine.  Mussels, winter slaw, crispy chicken with a pan sauce and sides such as sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts.  Three of us, eating there once were able to circumnavigate the entire menu on our maiden voyage.  A narrow menu is, in my opinion, preferable to those longer tomes that shield diners from their friends, but it also should be an ironclad guarantee of goodness and it ought to unite the staff in singular clarity.  This was not so.\n\nWhile we waited at the bar, the bartender (who opened and poured our wine into charming, tempered glass cups procured from the French school system) explained to us the specials and the cheese and charcuterie boards.  When we were seated, our waiter explained a winter slaw in remarkably different terms than his colleague (and closer to the actual item) but seemed reluctant or uniformed about the meats and cheeses.  \n\nAs for the food, many dishes were spot on.  A pork chop and rib came on a butcher block and was cooked to temperature perfectly.  The rib meat came of the bone easily and the chopped was splayed out with decorum.  But an appetizer of mussels was stringy and unappealing; the accompanying toast was scorched and insipid (rather than burnt and bitter) and seemed a poor--cheap even--substitute for the fries that make a moules frites so rewarding.  I wished I had settled, instead, for the winter slaw whose proportions of fennel, rutabaga and white cheddar matched the restaurants d\u00e9cor and mood instead of challenging it. \n\nThe chicken, the much talked about chicken, I should say, was as good as a chicken breast can be, but still chicken and the pan sauce was not easily applied sitting, as it was, beneath the bird on a platter that did not allow for easy dipping.  \n\nEverything was quite good, but the most glaring inconsistency was found in the sides and an obligatory pasta dish (aimed, probably, for vegetarians).  A plate of butternut squash ravioli was tasty, but served as an entr\u00e9e (and listed as one) it seemed remarkably outdone by the similarly priced pork or chicken dishes.  My fianc\u00e9, who is not given to such complaints, was keen to remark on the paucity of the serving.  Meanwhile two earthenware ramekins arrived is discordant fashion.  The first was teeming with buttery Brussel sprouts daring each other to spill over.  The second was filled, rather unfilled, with three sad fingerlings of sweet potato, which hid behind the gunwales of the ramekin like timid deckhands in a storm.\n\nIt is a bit louche to dispute portions when discussing dining, but with the chef working the line these missteps.  As good and affordable as Vinegar Hill House is, it cannot afford such discrepancies.", "author": "Kevin K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-10", "description": "The fact that this place is not easy to find makes me like it even better. It feels like a secret hideaway with beautiful decor and amazing food served right to my personal wooden table, a secret hideaway that everyone seems to know about. There's no doubt that others feel the same way because the wait tends to be around an hour or more on the weekends. But if you come on a weekday you can get a cozy table or a spot at the copper plated bar and actually feel like this place is all your own. \n\nThe food is completely worth the wait, with a menu that changes frequently based on the local and fresh produce, you can always know your going to be eating something that  was well thought out, from farmer to chef. My favorites include the octopus starter, with charred lemon, olives and yogurt sauce and the butternut squash risotto, a light dish with big chunks of squash. For the quality of the food it is very decently priced with entrees under $25. The pork chop has been featured in magazines, television and blogs all over and is a comfort to eat, cooked medium rare and served on a rustic cutting board to match the decor. \n\nThe wine list is also a reason I love to come to this place, it's relatively small but incredibly well planned. You can get a great bottle for under $25, which is unheard of at any Manhattan restaurant of this quality. Their mixed drinks, though a little more pricey are both innovative and strong, something you feel you could have ordered from a speakeasy in the 20's. My favorite thing is to sit at the bar to eat a meal and have the bartender recommend a wine or cocktail for the course. They are always nice and willing to suggest new and interesting drinks, and share a story or two while they work. \n\nOverall, I love Vinegar Hill House. Especially on a Monday night when you can take your time and enjoy a meal without the crowd. Also it's nice to actually see the staff as people and talk with them, something that's harder to do on the nights where the wait can be up to 2 hours. I would suggest Vinegar Hill to anyone who wants to get away from the bustle of Manhattan and share a delicious secret.", "author": "Kate M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-26", "description": "This place is pretentious and incredibly noisy, two of my least favorite things.
