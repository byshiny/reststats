A slice is a little bit on the pricy side but since I went to high school around there I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe cheesecake was a bit on the dense side. It was rich and good but not for me.

This place is a gem! Have a sandwich and a slice of cheesecake and you will not be disappointed,", "author": "Eddie A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-31", "description": "Aside from being famously featured in MTV's Making the Band, I have heard plenty of praise on how good the cheesecake is here. After all, New York is known for its cheesecake so I had to try it among all the other famous NY foods I tried on this visit. Except I took the subway to get here, I didn't walk! haha\n\nUpon entering, the diner like atmosphere reminded me of similar diners we have in California. (Mel's or Ruby's anyone?) The first thing you notice is the large display cases of cheesecakes and other desserts, however I opted for the take out counter which conveniently had assorted slices of cheesecake and a quick order menu for other food options. I only ordered the plain cheesecake to keep it original for about $5. \n\nThe cheesecake was really good, sweet but not too rich and had a good homemade taste to it. However, I'd like to come back and try their regular food items and different flavored cheesecakes to get an all around feel. Although some of my friends that did order food say it was super good. But based on this visit alone it definitely deserves 5 stars. If you visit don't walk, even if Diddy asks you to!", "author": "Derek A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-31", "description": "Shame on Junior's.  The prices they charge and they use margarine instead of butter.  I saw a documentary on TV and Juniors seemed proud they used margarine.  Margarine is one molecule away from plastic.  Went here when I was single 50 years ago.  That was in the Oleo margarine days and only the poor ate margarine.", "author": "James T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-03", "description": "Great service, food was above par and quick.

The retro interior is cool.  The pastrami and corned beef reuben was pretty good. The goulash was pretty good.  The service is really, really bad.  It always has been, at least since I first visited in 1983.  And with the prices they charge, the place should be cleaner.   Just have the cheesecake.", "author": "c l."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-17", "description": "Forget the cheesecake, which is delicious, how about their breakfasts?  Reasonably priced entrees come with a nice pastry platter, coffee AND juice.  It's a great place for large groups and they're always extremely friendly.  If you can't make up your mind, or are with a group that includes children, definitely check this place out for breakfast!", "author": "Timothy L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-10", "description": "This is my favorite restaurant hands down.

Sure, the d\u00e9cor could use some updating but ...every time I return I have nostalgic memories of my childhood visits. Cheesecake is still the best!  and they always serve a huge portion.

It's been grounded in Jewish deli yet has evolved to include items such as real fried catfish, not just a reasonable facsimile. The waitstaff are very friendly and professional.

It was described to me that as dishes came out, unsuspecting women had saucer eyes as foods approached the table. They also had drinks - an apple martini that was pretty much a martini with apple scent, and a tequila sunrise, which was orange flavored tequila. At least you get your money's worth.\n\nThey brought me home a Reuben with corned beef and pastrami. Very delicious, even cold. The meat is piled high in the classic deli style, so you need to squeeze the sandwich down to take a bite. Also - I was under the impression that Reuben's were traditionally made with russian dressing - why the hell do I always have to specify to put that on? Make those lame-asses who don't want deliciousness ask to omit it. \n\nI had to sub in some mustard, which is good, but not the same.

Everything else is tasty \u0026 they have a HUGE selection of food on their menu. I NEVER get their cheesecake but the other food is worth the experience.
