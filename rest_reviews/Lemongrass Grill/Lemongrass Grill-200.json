We ordered for pickup on a Friday night and enjoyed the food so much we came again on a Saturday.  I ordered the shrimp nana (or something like that), completely delicious and fresh.

I found myself hungry and with some time to kill the other day so I decided to try it. I opted for the lunch special which was a great deal. You get a sampling of appetizers, a sizable entree with rice on the side and a drink.\nOne of my favorite foods is eggplant so when I saw that this place had basil eggplant with chicken I jumped at the chance to try it. I enjoyed my food and while it may not have been the fanciest it was definitely tasty and perfect if you want a quick Thai meal. I have to say the service here was great and I have never received my food so quickly before.\nIf you are looking for a tasty and affordable lunch that I would definitely suggest coming here.", "author": "Nicolle B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-06", "description": "As I reached this place I was extremely excited due to the known reviews of the place.  I had went with my friend for lunch, we came in very welcoming.  We ordered our lunch specials, once we received out appetizers 5 mins in they decide to bring our food out..Mind you if I'm not done with my appetizer why would i want my entree.  We tell the waiter not now we are still eating, 10 mins later he comes back with the entree ( still not done with the appetizers).. after that attempt I just gave in for the food WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE COLD.  I had ordered chicken w/ veggies.  The chicken looked so undone the added veggies(unknown) were so unnecessary the usual is broccoli and carrots and whatever veggies they add, Ive had better thai food and this place was not the one..", "author": "Zee W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-01", "description": "Really nice atmosphere - not too loud or too quiet. Attentive waitress who remembered not to give me Ice on my water refill (I know, I know, but I get tooth aches!). Shrimp salad was popping with flavor - delish! Steamed dumplings were fine. Curry puffs were ok but really good with relish. Veggie broccoli with rice was just ok but maybe ordered the wrong thing? \nOverall good experience but the two I dined with said they would give it a 3!", "author": "Lara W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-26", "description": "Looks can be deceiving. \n\nI guess they spent all their attention in making their restaurant look cool, and no attention to their food.\n\nThe restaurant is bright in a good way, the staff is friendly, and they play pretty good music.  Overall, a nice and casual atmosphere.  That is why it has two stars versus one.  However, the food here is a major bust.\n\n- Fresh Spring Rolls:  Not on the menu, they do have fresh veggie spring rolls when we asked. However, maybe they are not on the menu for a reason, because these were awful.  The wrapper was old and seemed too thick with the edges dry and gummy. The insides were funky and overstuffed. Just bad bad.\n- Thai Green Curry: Definitely hit the mark as one of the worst thai green curries I have had.  The curry clearly seemed old and oily as if it was sitting on the stovetop all day, or was from the night before. It emulsifed so the oil and sauce was separating. The chicken was flavorless. And it really did not have that good coconut taste it should have. Awful.\n- Coconut Pudding Dessert: I guess this was the saving grace of the meal, because it was decent.  However, in hindsight I cannot tell if it was actually good or just in comparison to everything else it was good.\n\nAll in all. There are three other thai places in a three block radius of this place.  They must be better this place, because the items were not fresh and seemed to be leftovers from the week.", "author": "Natalie G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-05-22", "description": "Best Thai iced coffee.
