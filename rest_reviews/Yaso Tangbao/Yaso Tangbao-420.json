Chinese people are starting to catch on that decor matters at a restaurant, at this ' hip' exposed wood and brick interior, they are allow to charge $1.60 for white rice. Serving small dishes, noodle soups, easy for sharing and take-away. It is still fast food after all where they impatiently yell out order numbers across the restaurant. But with plenty of seating and bust your own tray when done, feel free to linger.\nNot a culinary break through, the hot \u0026 sour soup (\u9178\u8fa3\u6e6f) could use more ingredients. A reliable spot when you crave Chinese food in a setting where it isn't grimy florescent lighting with linoleum floors, much like the two asian places next doors.", "author": "Vada O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-01", "description": "Best in the town Shanghainess food with signature xiaolongbao. The noodles and rice dishes are also tasty. You definitely get your value in the food.\n\nRestaurant is also spacious and food is prepared fast and fresh. Many Subway lines lead you directly to the restaurant.\n\nStrongly recommended!", "author": "Jim C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-16", "description": "Aesthetics of this place is cute. Looks very neat and clean with an open kitchen to see the process of them making soup dumplings.\n\nOkay food. Not as good as I expected. I was looking forward to the soup dumplings as well as the pan fried pork buns. The soup dumplings were kind of cold when bitten into it, not sure how they're regulating the temperature for this. The pan fried pork buns were okay, although the presentation was nice and the skin was okay, there wasn't much flavoring in the pork. I ordered the fried chicken fillet noodle soup as well. Best component of this dish was probably the chicken fillet, that's it.\n\nThere are restaurants out there that serves better soup dumplings, in my opinion. This isn't the best.", "author": "Shi Lin W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-10", "description": "The dumplings at this joint are solid. Ordered the pan-seared pork Baos and the soup dumplings. The Baos were juicy and had a good proportion of bread to filling. The bread was just the right texture- soft but with a nice chew The soup dumplings were pretty good too. Portions were fantastic, a really good deal for a filling meal.

I couldn't see how they were that different from regular dumplings because they were never soupy, and the skins were always kind of thick.\n\nTurns out I'd just never had good ones before. Then I went to Yaso Tangbao on a whim when I was running errands around Fulton one day. NOW I get XLB. I just hadn't had good ones! With delicate skins and plenty of soupy goodness (see: my shirt), this is what the big deal is all about. \n\nI ordered the tonkatsu soup as well, and it was fine, but the star were the XLB and that's what I'd go back for.", "author": "Jaye B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-04", "description": "Food is decent. Xiaolongbao skins are thick which I am not used to and the fried buns are more buns than meat and bit oily on outside. Though the restaurant is clean and very nicely kept.

My friend ordered the Soy Fried Rice with Chicken Fillet, which he enjoyed though he did comment it was on the greasy side. I ordered the Chicken Curry Noodle Soup and Spicey Pork Soup Dumpling, and both of them tasted delicious! I favored the soup more then the dumpling, but I loved them both.

Their youtiao bread sticks are way too hard. The first time I ordered them, the youtiao were hard as a rock and completely inedible, I'm not even exaggerating, because I really could not bite into the bread and the inside dough was just as hard. The second time I ordered, they were a little better, the outside was crunchy, but still hard and the inside was not soft either.\n2. Their noodles are very bland. \n\nOther than that, the rest of their food is pretty good. I like their rice dices and I LOVE their soup dumplings!

First time trying cold noodles of any kind and it was pretty refreshing and tasty. I've had pan fried buns in the past, but these were beyond comparison; perfectly crusted on the bottom but soft when you take that first bite.

Finally a place in downtown Brooklyn that has real Chinese food. Soup dumplings- made fresh, onsite, to order. Skin is thin and delicious. Filling is perfect. As good as anything you can find in Chinatown and Flushing. Beef noodle soup is ok, but it's a really hard dish to get right anywhere. The soup had the right flavors, but was a bit watered down. The meat in it was well seasoned.\n\nThat's all I tried, but I'll be back for sure.

I love Shanghainese food but don't eat pork which eliminates most soup dumpling places for me. Luckily Yaso Tangbao is looking out for us vegetarians. There were plenty of menu options for me and I opted for the garden vegetable crispy noodle which came with this delicious empty dumpling thing. The fried sticky rice was also great. I loved how clean and welcoming the space is. You can see them making the soup dumplings behind a glass wall. Wish they served beer to go along with the meal.

I guess that's the way this neighborhood is going but if you're itching for soup buns then Yaso Tangbao is probably as good as any place you can find in NYC.\n\nThere's literally a small army of people visible when you walk into this place, working around the clock to make soup buns (I'm guessing). It's a pretty impressive operation and I'll have to come back and try the noodles and rice dishes.

A little pricy for soup dumplings, but the spicy soup dumplings were GREAT! Thin skins, great flavor. The regular pork soup dumplings are clean and tasty but not as flavorful as Joe's or the spots in Flushing. Definitely spring for the spicy. The garlic fried greens: really great -- not overcooked, simple -- and a nice serving size. The fried bao were ok.\n\nCould be improved in two significant ways:\n- The disposable spoons, while I appreciate that they seem to be biodegradable, are completely not up to the task of eating soup dumplings out of. They don't even really have rims; they are more like cardboard paddles. Please get reusable, regular spoons.\n\n- Chili oil: $1.00????? Give me a break! That hurt my feelings. Sriracha is a travesty for anyone who wants a little kick with their bao or regular soup dumplings.\n\nWill probably be back for the spicy soup dumplings and to split one of the enormous entrees with someone.", "author": "midge j."}], "servesCuisine": "Shanghainese", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Yaso Tangbao", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "148 Lawrence St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n8qkl-utd4uCMlOy46G05g/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+19293377599"}
