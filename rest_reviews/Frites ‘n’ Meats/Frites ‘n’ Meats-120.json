But sadly, the savory trip came to a quick halt without further service.\n\n\nAfter the meat, I was under the impression that these guys were just starting out, and was still working on figuring out the little kinks to fix their not yet perfected system.\n\nThe frites, sadly, was the weakest act in their showing, especially combind with the rather heavy, stale mayo-ish tasting dipping sauce that killed it completely (I couldn't finish the fries and dip sauce).\n\nI had a few problems with their menu, but I also recognize large room for them to grow. After all, their burger meats were solid. An they seem to work with artisanal ingredients, though they don't cut the rinds off the brie on my burger. Me no likey rinds :/  \n\nI will give Frites N' Meats a benefit of the doubt for future growth and remain positive.

It's appealing that there's a choice of bun (brioche, potato, and sesame);  I opted for the brioche which was mediocre despite coming from Balthazar. They were pretty stingy with the brie I picked as an additional topping. Normally I only have fruit juice during the day and this burger is certainly not worth straying from a diet for.\n\nI was much happier with the frites; they were a tad undercooked and lacking of salt but that's my preference so for me it was great. The side of garlic aioli was great as a dipping sauce- perhaps a bit too garlicky but tasty nonetheless. \n\nSummary: Savory frites.

I have eaten at every midtown burger joint there is.  This is at least as good as the best of the steakhouse burgers, blowing away the Parker Meridien, Shake Shack, 5 Brothers and others in this price range.  The weekly special burgers have yet to fail me. Typically a perfect combination of quality ingredients and flavors.  It's hard to heap more superlatives on this truck.  Look, they have blown the occasional order of my friends, and the meat was once undercooked (always preferable to the opposite), and its a food truck, so how much can you hope for, but given all of that, it still earns five stars.

I called in my order and it was ready when I got there.  Pretty tasty burger, but not in my Top 5.  And wrapped in foil and a paper bag served from a truck... well, it just didn't seem special.

Where could I get something \"fast\" but better quality?\n\nHow opportunistic that I should walk right by this truck and see somewhat of line. That's a good sign right? \n\nThey don't ask you how you want your burger cooked. It was medium which is a little too undercooked for me. I assumed that they would serve it medium-well/well-done. My mistake. \n\nThe saving grace was the onion jam. That was tasty. The mesclun greens you get are like 5 small leaves and end up getting soggy by the time you open up your burger. Not cool. I don't remember if the meat was seasoned, but I'm guessing not. \n\nThe potato bun was way too big. Bread should be minimal in the burger. They also gave me a filthy can of diet coke. I mean like black soot all over it. Pretty disgusting.

Coming from Austin, TX - which in the past 5 years has gone food truck crazy, it is great to see such high quality food coming out of trucks in NYC,  the only minor disappointment is in their Jalape\u00f1os.  I like my burgers spicy and am a much bigger fan of how Zeitzeff does their's, grilling them and slicing them lengthwise.  These seemed like they were out of a jar, though I could be wrong.  I got cheddar which was very tasty and much better than Zeitzeff's as was the size of the burger.  These folks know what they are doing.

They try really hard.   The quality of ingredients belong in a gourmet restaurant (angus?  wagyu?).\n\nThe entire menu is burgers, myriad toppings for those burgers, fries and a few more baked goods, and not much else.

A full meal was a bit of a drain on the wallet and should set most back by $10 to $12 for burger and fries only.  The burger I got was the Angus topped with gruyere cheese, onion, tomato, greens, and guacamole on a brioche bun.  The burger was cooked medium but was a bit on the lukewarm side by the time I got back to my office.  Despite the lack of warmth, the burger tasted pretty good.  For size comparison, I'd say it's a bit bigger and taller than a Whopper Jr.\n\nThe frites are where I have to take off the most points off because they were pretty unremarkable.  The fries did not appear to be \"handcut\" as advertised and resembled McDonald's fries (albeit much less greasy).  The amount of fries they give you is also a bit disappointing considering the $3 price tag on it.  The only thing that saved the fries were the dipping sauces (an extra $0.50).  I got the horseradish and garlic, which were both fantastic and packed quite a punch.  I really wish they could improve the fries to taste a bit more like actual homemade fries and given you a bit more for the steep price tag on them.\n\nI'd recommend this with some reservations.  It's probably worth it for an Angus burger, which should set you back $7 with a reasonable amount of toppings.  I will pass on the fries next time they go here until they improve them.
