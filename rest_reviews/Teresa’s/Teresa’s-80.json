They had a bunch of tables outside and the whole experience was pleasant. We went there for a late lunch on a Sunday and they still offered the whole breakfast and lunch menu, which I think is great. \n\nThe food wasn't extraordinary but we weren't expecting anything more for the price. The service could have been a tad bit better, but place was crowded a bit so you can understand.", "author": "Yogesh K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-23", "description": "Awful experience! Left before the drinks even arrived because of rude waitress! My friend and I went here in the afternoon, no one came to see us for 10 minutes, no drink order or greeting, finally a woman came and asked if we were ready, we said we would like drinks first, she asked us again if we were ready, again we said we would like drinks first, she took our drink order and then asked for our menus, we said we were ordering food, she sighed and walked away, and the menu said that they served breakfast all day and to ask for the menu, my friend asked about breakfast,\nthe waitress said they didnt have breakfast, which obviously isnt true considering the pictures people have posted, we decided to leave before she came back with the drinks because we didn't feel like having our dinner ruined by a rude waitress.

Oh, and the tuna salad platter is nice. The sandwiches are hit-or-miss, the grilled cheese is pretty bad, the French fries are often a little soggy. They seem to have a complete change-over of waitstaff about every 3 months, so service is hit-or-miss as well.", "author": "michael r."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-20", "description": "Went here for grandma's bday dinner because she used to go to the old Teresa's in Manhattan with my grandpa. Food was excellent and so was the service. Everyone that ordered soup was very happy and my wife and I ordered and shared the chicken cutlet and pierogis.

The latter is a clear soup, tasty, tart, and refreshing, with lots of diced beets and a whole hard boiled egg submerged in it.  When you add a boiled potato to the cold red borscht, it reaches a whole other level of old country goodness.\n\nI've had the veal meat balls here and they deliver what they promise, bland non-assertive flavor that will leave you full and satisfied.  This place will do in a pinch when you have that Central European food craving and don't want to travel out to Greenpoint.", "author": "Jeff J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "My friend brought me here because she said it was good, and she was right. I'm a big fan of Polish food, but opted for just a bowl of cold borscht on a summer day. \nBorscht is different everywhere you go; theirs has the sour cream on the side. It has a nice \"zing\" that I thought was cayenne pepper, but the waitress said was garlic. My friend enjoyed her soup and sandwich.

Potato pancakes are huge (even at half portion).  Though I may have been full after 3 orders of the miseria cucumber dill salad -- It's that good.  Fresh cup of cold borsht on a summer day.

I should have checked Yelp before sitting down to order. Prices are reasonable which is why they get 1 star. The food is at best \"old diner\" quality and the service was almost non existent. After our order came to our table our server never came back except to drop off the check. I ordered the bacon and egg omelette and it was as dry as beef jerky and about as flavorful as styrofoam peanuts. I would not recommend the breakfast here. Someone in our party ordered the vegetable soup and said it was good so that accounts for the 2nd star.", "author": "El O."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-01", "description": "I enjoy their breakfast.

I was served by a woman with short blond hair who I believe is an owner of the restaurant. I ordered a cup of soup and a half order of meat perigees. When it was served I was given the combination. I pointed this out to the server who was terribly nasty and insisted that I said combination. Despite the fact that I had not asked for a combination plate which I kept telling her she treated me with utter disrespect insisting that I was wrong and didn't have the slightest idea what I had said.  Even if I had asked for a combination, which I did not, wouldn't you think that she would've been gracious and taken it back and replace it with what I said I ordered.\n\nI truly don't understand this behavior I doubt I would've gotten this type of behavior from a regular waitress but from an noxious owner is too much.", "author": "Joel N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-09-05", "description": "If you want to wait for mediocre food served with surliness and neglect than this is the place for you.  Neither food nor service can save this place.  I think Yelp should have a 1/2 star rating for places like this.  Firstly, let me say that I did everything wrong.  I should have called the manager, but instead I paid and tipped because I didn't want to show out with a client I was with.The waitress brought me a chef salad with a half cooked egg on it and some oscar meyer deli meat on iceberg lettuce.  I said this isn't what I was expecting and she told me this is what I ordered.  I didn't eat it.  When she finally came back she asked if I wanted it wrapped up and i said, it's disgusting -- no thanks.  She said, this is what you ordered.  Then I looked in my glass of iced tea (half drunk) and see a bug clinging to the inside of the glass.  I Point this out to her and she shrugs.  Her whole attitude was that I was trying to keep from paying.  So for my half of the $41 tab I had 4 pierogies that were both greasy on the outside and dry on the inside 1/2 a glass of iced tea and an indictment from the waitress that what I ordered is what I got even if I didn't like it or it was inedible.  They didn't even take the iced tea off my bill.  What an unpleasant group of people who work in there.  so incredibly nasty, rude and lacking any sense of customer service.", "author": "Cally W."}], "servesCuisine": "Diners", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Teresa\u2019s", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "80 Montague St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ce3em1AqfP8NgnnDJRC-xw/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187973996"}
