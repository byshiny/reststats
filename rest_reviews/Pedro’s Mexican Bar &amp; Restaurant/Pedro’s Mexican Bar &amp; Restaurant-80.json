My table of three ordered a pitcher of margaritas and appetizers and entrees. After 30 minutes we got our pitcher. Then 5 minutes later we got our appetizers. They tasted good. An hour and a half with no communication from waitstaff goes by and we've yet to receive our food. We ask the waitress and she says \"we ran out of black beans so your meals were delayed but we know.\" Meanwhile a table of people who have been seated for 10 minutes received their food with what do you know, black beans!!! I think it's unfair to lie to a customer. It would've been more standup to admit you forgot to place our orders. This was a waste of time experience in New York. I would never come here again.

Explained the happy hour ordered a margarita ! Margarita was very good . Used a pre made mix which was a bit of a turn off but it was surprisingly good . Big plastic cup want to say 12oz so it was worth 12 bucks . Food menu looks good would come back to try the food for sure . But the second bartender didn't seem to friendly , seemed to be aggressive not sure maybe just his personality. But he should be a bit more welcoming just an opinion . Other then that I'll be back for sure let's see maybe it was just a bad day for him .", "author": "Greg K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-07", "description": "I wanted to like this spot, but sadly I do not.  The atmosphere looks cool, like a classic divey Mexican spot.  The food is great!  The service is terrible.  They don't even know what service is. And not even in a way that suggests they're just busy - it's just, no understanding of customer service.  And the seating kinda sucks but that's the vibe so whatever.  Also, the food is WILDLY overpriced.  A $9 guacamole which is just OK comes with about two tablespoons. Their prices are more in line with a fine dining Mexican spot.\nBecause of the service and the prices, and the good tasting but not mind blowing food, I'm not interested in going here, but I'm sure enough corny yuppies who want to feel \"authentic\" still will!", "author": "Joey B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-14", "description": "Love the food at Pedro's and they're very, very kind.

The owners and servers welcome us with smiles. Outside seating is great in summer but inside is fun too. Reasonable prices and good food. We like shrimp alajillo, tilapia, all the burritos, and sweet plantain. There's a lunch special daily, a full bar, and several vegetarian options, including the spinach burrito. Colorful murals inside and out. A Dumbo fixture. We recommend Pedro's highly.

You might walk into the restaurant/bar with a cozy, warm feeling thanks to their colorful interior and low ceilings. However, you'll soon realize that this all means nothing.\n\nCame here for lunch with a group of coworkers and it was easy enough to get seats, possible because they just opened up outdoor seating for the warmer weather. \n\nThe waitress messed up our orders on several fronts. One person didn't get cheese and sour cream on her burrito, as requested. My drink didn't show up until I was nearly done with my meal. Another person didn't get his food at all until we waited for nearly 10-15 minutes and decided to check on it. Apparently, the waitress never put his food order down.\n\nI had the crispy burrito bowl with steak. It was decent. Their food isn't bad and it's priced fairly, especially when there aren't many choices here around DUMBO.\n\nIt feels like the restaurant is understaffed, where staff is running around trying to serve patrons and they're overwhelmed. They misplace orders, forget orders, and you just have to ask them 3+ times before you actually get something. I think they need better management and a re-training of staff to make this place more efficient. A big improvement could come from something as simple as restating our orders at the beginning of the meal or an \"am I missing anything?\" when food is served.", "author": "Simon Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-28", "description": "Don't believe the hipster reviews on here.

Definitely worth checking out. I came here for drinks so I can't rate the food but everything smelled good. Love the funky decor \u0026 ambiance.

Every summer I walk by on my way to relax by the water and every year I say, \"Next time. Next time.\" That may be why I hyped it up in my head before hand. So I had to put those lofty expectations in check when I finally made it to Pedro's. I wanted it to be a five star experience so very badly. \n\nI'll start with what's important: the food and drinks. I loved my margarita. It was just strong enough to make me feel warm and fuzzy after my meal and distract me from the heat. I thought it was a little too small but at least it was a good pour. And I don't typically  The chicken tostadas were pretty good. The chicken was seasoned so well and perfectly pulled. Every bite was tasty. I didn't love the fried tortilla which was more of one big hard taco shell or oversized nacho. It made it like a personal sized chicken nacho serving. But that did not stop me from inhalin two tostadas. The chips and guac were yummy. It was darn good guac and if you know me you know I judge guac harshly. However, it was WAY too small a guac serving for a full bowl price. It was basically a small side of guac that you pay around 8-9 bucks for. It was small enough to give me pause when it came out. Guac is not meant to be rationed. At least not in my life. Overall, while food and drink were tasty it was overpriced for the portions.\n\nNow to a little heads up for future diners. Picture it: the first super hot day of the spring season and so we opted to sit outside. Typically I don't care to sit outside at any restaurant because this is New York City, pigeons eat outside...I eat inside where there is air conditioning...but I digress. We were warned the only table available was in the sun. We should have listened. It took about three minutes before we were sweating buckets and our cell phones were giving us that \"phone overheating move to cooler area\" warnings. We should have listened to our phones and not just covered the phones. Note to all eating at Pedro's. Eat inside. Like I said, pigeons eat outside, and now that I think about it they probably find a shady spot. Humans, easily dehydrated humans, eat inside.", "author": "Kristen M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-15", "description": "Not sure what all the negative reviews here are about. I think a lot of people reviewing this place completely miss the point of this restaurant.\n\nYes, the interior is small but in my opinion that adds a great vibe to this place. There is also great outdoor seating which you cant kind everywhere.\n\nThe portion sizes are on the small side for at the price point they provided they are fair for a restaurant in the heart of DUMBO. \n\nZero problem with service. Ordered the beef burrito which was out of the kitchen in no more then 5 minutes. It was good but not the best. I was confused whether of not I was suppose to eat it with a fork or knife or not.  I made the terrible decision of trying the pick it up. It flopped revealing its tasty mexican innards. No worries though, just absolutely drenched that bad boy with the hot sauce on the table (which is fantastic) and things went smoothly from there.\n\nOrdered the wings which came 10 for $10.  I have to say these were the best part of the meal. These little deep fried bad boys rocked it. Super crispy, very tasty 10/10 will steal your chicken wings.\n\nTry this place out if you want some casual sit down mexican food in the DUMBO area.", "author": "Ryan R."}], "servesCuisine": "Mexican", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Pedro\u2019s Mexican Bar \u0026 Restaurant", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "73 Jay St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/jDgcvuN47c7UcF_cBM4uQQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187972851"}
