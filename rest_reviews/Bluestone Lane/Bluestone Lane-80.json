The iced latte is my drink of choice, regardless of the time of year. I've also tried the banana, almond honey toast and the salmon cream cheese toast. I love the latter more although they can afford to give you two pieces of toast. The service is always on point and the setup is beautiful. Download the Level Up app as a loyalty reward program.

I frequent Bluestone Lane every week (and try to hit every location in the city) and bring friends along each time too.\n\nThis morning, I trekked to the Dumbo location for the first time. Location is prime - right across from the Etsy HQ, and next door to the soon-to-open Dig Inn and a Row House. \n\nThe space is BEAUTIFUL. Familiar + similar to the other Bluestone Lane locations, this one feels a little more elevated (not sure why) - with flamingo wallpaper, a beautiful long counter of people preparing amazing coffee and bites. Ample seating, and WIFI + OUTLETS (no other Bluestone Lane location has these I believe). I camped out for a solid 2 hours writing, checking e-mails, and enjoying my iced soy latte (I get this every time) and the Dumbo-location special, the squash toast.\n\nThe squash toast was absolutely mind blowing. Thick cut multigrain toast, topped with a pureed squash w/ dukka spices, roasted beets + labneh. Literally a dream.\n\nWas an amazing morning, with perfect service, music, food, drink and people. So glad I checked out Dumbo - will definitely be back!", "author": "Roopa S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-15", "description": "Stopped here for breakfast/brunch this morning.\n\nImmediately +1 for this place because it doesn't make it impossible to order something if you have dietary restrictions. I can't have dairy, so I was relieved to find out their beet root latte is made by default with almond milk. No special ordering for me! The latte was delicious and a great alternative to regular coffee, which I'm trying to stay away from. They seem to have a huge selection of other lattes and iced/hot beverages, so I'll be back to try some others.\n\nI also ordered the Market Bowl, which I believe was a special. Roasted squash, brussels sprouts, broccoli, and spinach with a poached egg (it also included feta, which I asked to omit). This was a great healthy brunch, and the poached egg made it so delicious that I didn't even need the tahini they included. Very flavorful.\n\nI only wish this place were a bit less pricy. I wasn't expecting to spend $20 on brunch, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.", "author": "Nicole T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-13", "description": "I am updating my review for Bluestone Lane because of their incredible customer service in response to my original two star review. I won't get into the details, but they took my review very seriously and more than made up for my bad experience. I have been in a few times since and have had only exceptional experiences with the staff, food and coffee drinks. I only hesitate to give a full 5 stars because it's so damn expensive.

Note: it was 7:30 am on a Sunday and they were friendly! The coffee shop itself is decorated like a tropical oasis, so bright and inviting. I am both a coffee fanatic and matcha lover, so I grabbed an iced matcha with almond emily and a cold brew. All the hype was legit; matcha was rich and green with a great natural sweetness.

I normally pop in for a coffee to go. Which is fine. But lately I have dined in with my husband or a friend from yoga. Service is just bad and food is inconsistent. It's not a warm, cozy Brooklyn place. Feels corporate and off. Love the menu, but it needs an infusion of TLC to feel good. 2 thumbs up!!!

Their \"heirloom\" tomatoes are run of the mill tomatoes.\n\nFood took quite some time for what we had ordered (just two pieces of toast) and again very over priced (we ended up spending $50 on just two toasts and coffee).\n\nWe also mentioned our disappointment  to our waitress and they didn't so much as comp our coffees.\n\nThere are so many great places to eat!
