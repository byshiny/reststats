This place is a little shack located next to lots of other hole in the wall stores- many of which are also under-rated (I got spare keys made for a $1.50 at the repair shop  next door). I actually came out a few cents short when paying for my pizza, and was going to run to a bank, and the guy at the counter insisted that I just pay what I could. I have promised him I'll be back, and will pay a little extra for my next piece:) God knows, the pizza is worth more than they are charging.", "author": "B K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-25", "description": "its really hard to find a good pizzeria in ny, and its good to know i have one a block away from me lol AND that delivers!!!! but it has to be $15.00 and up to get it delivered. every month i get a pie from them and it never disappoints.", "author": "Shereme G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-04-26", "description": "worst delivery ever. waited nearly 2 hours on a thursday evening for my food. not even the best pizza is worth the 2 hour wait. called twice for an update on my order and each time they told us it was \"leaving the store in 2 minutes.\" worst service - will never be ordering from here again. i suggest you don't either.", "author": "Laura F."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Pipitone Pizzeria", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "100 Dekalb Ave", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/mkfzo8iY3TjZJADk9wb_Eg/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188584376"}
