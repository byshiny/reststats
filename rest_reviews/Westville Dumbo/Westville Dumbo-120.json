I was a big fan of their EV location and was pumped when they moved to bk. Seems like they need some of the leadership of their other stores to step in and raise the bar here. They're constantly running out of menu items, the wine \u0026 beer list is much different then what they have and their staff is a lil green and not educated on the menu (ingredients, allergies, etc) \n\nBeware they close much earlier then they advertise too. \n\nStep it up Westville!", "author": "John L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-20", "description": "We must have picked the worse items on the menu - the grilled chicken was dry the fries cold the fish overly fried...not planning on coming back.

The food is fresh and there is an abundant of vegetable choices. I really feel taken care of...like someone wants me to eat something nourishing, and that means a lot.

Only giving a 4 star this time because the salad I got (cauliflower BBQ quinoa salad) wasn't as good as my regular order (market plate with 4 veggies). Still was very sizable- I brought home leftovers so it was essentially 2 meals. My fianc\u00e9 got the Cobb and loved it. Very spacious and they have an outdoor area.

Diners combine vegetables and around 5 meat or fish offerings to make meals, or choose from an array of complete plates. You probably want to know about the quality and it was excellent to very good. Ambition and creativity are the two ingredients missing from the food. We can tolerate or even welcome their absence when food which is good and good for you is the center of the experience. And a few dishes were remarkable, such as the mushroom special in chimichurri. We sat at the bar. The restaurant was comfortable and spacious. Here's the deets (20 May 17):\nSteak plate, 26, very good, the 8 ounce portion was excellent for sharing; who needs more than a quarter-pound of steak at a meal?\nMarket plate, 17, four vegetables from the gigantamous list on the blackboard and 3-4 more on the specials list.\nSmokey margarita, 12, mezcal and tequila, drank up; didn't need agave to sweeten it in favor of the fresh lime\nRose, 9, special price, good\n\nBONUS pleasant setting\nBONUS good value\nSHOUT OUT to Rosalee at the bar for being friendly and cheerful to us and everyone eating there\nBONUS family friendly\nTIP convenient to St Ann's Warehouse for pre-theater dining", "author": "Steve N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-15", "description": "Amazing food and service!

Food is good, staff/service is good BUT if you order for pick-up or delivery then check your order. Sides tend to be forgotten and something seems to have happened (on a corporate level?) with the green sauce. Not sure why you have to request this or speak to a manager to get it but it's delicious and I'm a bit sad to see it being faded out or just difficult to obtain. Almost wanted to take a second star off for forgotten items as this isn't a first time mistake.", "author": "anna m."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-01-11", "description": "A bit overpriced and overrated. The first time I came here, the food was good. But the second time I went, the cheese on my mac and cheese wasn't melted and was cold. It tasted really off.

DUMBO was the first. Sometimes I go into restaurants with high expectations. And I think maybe that's what I did here. The menu looks solid. It sounds amazing. But the food just fell short of that.

Called at 9:15, man said they were short staffed. Asked to hold. Man said he couldn't find order, asked to hold again. Was on hold for 8 minutes, call was cut off. Called back, they said they would send. Called again at 9:40, they said they didn't have ingredients but would send something. To their credit they said they wouldn't charge us. Arrived at 10:10. Cold slices of chicken with cold broccoli, not what we ordered. And a limp salad. Really nasty.

I really, really enjoyed the food and it was well priced - especially for all the food you get as well as the quality. The drinks were super tasty as well, and I definitely filled up on 'em thanks to our awesome bartender Kylie! She was stellar!

I've live in the city for three years and finally found a place with amazing eats to match the amazing cocktails for happy hour. Vegan meatballs are a must, even if you're not vegan. And the Grapefruit League was my fave cocktail!! Highly recommend their truffle fries too- not too heavy on the truffle like other places (I hate that).

Arugula, lemon, Parmesan salad add avocado and hangar steak is the go to order.  Tonight I got my steak and it was over cooked and chewy.  Because I order it all the time and it's always great I called the restaurant to let them know.  I was immediately connected to the manager who was gracious and apologetic.  He asked if I'd rather have a credit for my full meal (including the salad portion which was great) or a replacement.  I opted for the replacement.  It was delivered within 15 minutes and was delicious as usual.  Highly recommend!!!", "author": "Laura P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-19", "description": "Stopped in here for a late lunch and was pleasantly surprised. The ambience is great - relatively small with an urban, industrial feel. Service was excellent. They have an amazing selection of vegetable sides. They all sounded good so it was hard to choose only two. (They do have a plate where you can choose four vegetable sides)  I ordered the salmon plate with the beets \u0026 goat cheese and the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms with leeks. The salmon was prepared perfectly and the beets and mushrooms were delicious! We also ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad which was fresh and good - 4/5 on the Caesar.
