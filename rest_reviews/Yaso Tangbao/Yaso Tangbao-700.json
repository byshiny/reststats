Waited for a while for the crowds to die down. (I'm pretty sure it won't)( This place was a hole in the hole, I think Asian City.  I was jumping up and down when I saw the sign go up.  Shanghai Street Food.  Trumpets playing, Confetti in the air, hooray.  Finally got a taste,  didn't even bother to take pics, so excited.  One of my pet peeves, paying for bad food.  This was a huge disappointment.  I work a block away, dumplings was not even warm.  I was suspicious when they said food would be ready in 5 minutes.  But what do I know, I don't run a restaurant.  Crab/Pork dumplings - Costco frozen dumplings taste better than this.  How do you have dried dumplings, with no juice.  Isn't that why it's call soup dumplings.  Yes, I stand behind that statement.  Look at other Yelpers' pic, so small.  Don't get me wrong, it's edible, but 4 for $6.75, ever time after this, I'll walk down 2 short blocks and have Golden Fried Dumpling at 192 Duffield St.  Four dumplings for a dollar, 10 for 3.00 for boiled. They have so much more flavor.   Also got the Braised Beef noodle soup,  We were tasting the noodles, tasted like Ronzonni spaghetti,  Hey, Hey, that's what everyone at the office concluded.  So I'm not making this up to be a jerk.  Most of the pieces of beef that everyone had was extremely chewy, not in the good way.  The broth was missing everything, what you might asks? FLAVOR.   Another yelper wrote that the E. chef is from Joe Shanghai.  I find that extremely hard to believe, and if this is true, that's very unfortunate.  (Boss Man, no need to reply here, Y.T. will be successful regardless of my opinion.)", "author": "T J."}], "servesCuisine": "Shanghainese", "priceRange": "$11-30", "name": "Yaso Tangbao", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "148 Lawrence St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n8qkl-utd4uCMlOy46G05g/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+19293377599"}
