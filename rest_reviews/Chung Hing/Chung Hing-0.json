There are a couple of sit down restaurants you can take out from but most are expensive and don't give good portions.  Otherwise I can't find decent Chinese downtown.  Decided to hop on the subway a couple of stops and pick up food at Chung Hing in Brooklyn.  Had chicken and broccoli, white rice, roast pork, and beef mei-fun.  Entire meal was inexpensive and delicious.", "author": "Ross G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-08", "description": "What you want!  \n\nMe: Umm.. sweet and sour chicken with fried rice with egg drop...\n\nWhat fried rice??! (Making annoyed face at me)\n\nMe: ...soup.  The fried rice that comes with lunch special\n\nYou have to say pork!!  Pork fried rice!! (Shaking her head at me)\n\n------------------------------------------\nReview:\n\nService:  see above transcript\n\nFood:  soup is sour and flavorless.  Sweet and sour chicken only has a small bit of what appears to be chicken( I had to use zoom and use macro mode on my phone to capture the bit of chicken). Fried rice is just steamed rice with yellow food coloring.\n\nCleanliness:  cashier was handling money and preparing food at same time without the use of glove.\n\nValue:  not great considering the abuse.  Without abuse it would be excellent.", "author": "John C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-12-17", "description": "We have ordered here a couple of times but the food is just not good.

On the hunt for some lunch and having to pass through the UPS store, I opted for Chinese. This place is definitely a no-frills type of place with only a few tables for those who do not wish to order take out. \n\nThe service was fast but the friendliness stopped once I asked for BBQ sauce. The woman at the counter said it will cost an extra $1 (For BBQ sauce?). I was very skeptical about this upcharge and was wondering whether it was because I looked new to the neighborhood. Turns out, I was correct. I called the place less than 5 minutes later in my best Valley Girl voice asking for the same exact thing and for additional BBQ sauce. My price quote was 50 cents cheaper. \n\nThe food portion was okay for 1, filled me up, and the food was good for the most part but I will not frequent a place that tries to steal my money.", "author": "Steffi J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-25", "description": "Food is just ok. Cheap. Ordered Chinese ribs tonight.  They were so hard you couldn't eat them. I called them and they promptly sent me another order.  Same thing.  Hard. They have been slowly going downhill.

When I agreed to buy him food, he took me inside and ordered something (he said just \"a large\" to the lady taking orders) and I was charged $24. When I walked by 30 minutes later, he was chatting with the security guard of the restaurant and still asking people to buy him food. Another lady was questioning the employees about his food and told me she paid $22 to buy him food that never arrived.

The workers who take your order always sound like they're in a rush, even when you're the only person in the joint ordering.  I guess it's because during the peak lunch hours they probably get a lot of orders called in and folks coming by to get their grub on.  It's definitely a local spot that is in need of cosmetic upgrades but overall it's ok for a quick bite.", "author": "Esmeralda C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-12", "description": "Not so great. I had the General Tso's Chicken, spare ribs, and a few other things. Nothing was really good, except for the egg roll. The egg roll was the best part of the whole meal; everything else could use an assessment by restaurant management. The ribs were covered in a jello-like sauce and were riddled with bones and fat. The General Tso's Chicken did not taste like the typical General Tso's Chicken at all; it had a different flavor all-together. \n\nI have low standards for Americanized Chinese food, but this didn't meet the mark at all.", "author": "Albert A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-10", "description": "Not the best :( they put too much corn powder, so the dish and soup are all tooooo sticky", "author": "Wen-Ni C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-22", "description": "Working on set.

Ordered the mooshu pork and it was ready very quickly.  Good sized portions.  Good prices. The food was well cooked and seasoned and they don't add msg. I would not recommend dining in though they have tables there but would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for Chinese takeout.  I will definitely order from here again.

First off made a order for delivery I ordered chicken with Broccoli and that came with no sauce mixed in instead I have to mix it myself next they gave me no plates or forks which means now I'm literally eating from a bag to lay it out. Then I ordered chow mein which came back looking like chicken noodle soup idk what the hell they did but the whole order was messed up they sent the delivery man back only for him to take my chow mein and not come back it's been almost 3 hours since he last came so I know he isn't coming back I call the restaurant and they just hang up on me not saying anything. So this place gets a big F and a U cause they really gave me garbage to eat. Never will order from this place in my life again. I warn you stay away it's horrible the food is bad and the whole ordering is bad. They didn't even attempt to fix my order all they did was just take it away smh and you expect me to pay for that ?", "author": "Joshua S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-23", "description": "This is very solid Chinese takeout.

However, when I was eating lunch there today, a solicitor came in and they didn't make any effort to get him out.  i mentioned this to them as I left and just got blank stares.  in my opinion, the proprietor of a restaurant should not allow solicitors to come into their place of business and annoy paying customers while they are eating.
