I had the salmon bento lunch box it was a good size serving. It came with brown rice, california roll ,vegetables(frozen in the bag kind), fried gyoza , a salad and the salmon. The bento box was $10.45\nThere are two pros however 1) they substitute white rice for brown rice and 2) There salmon teriyaki skin was very crispy.\nBut overall very typical , nice place to go on a lunch break but no need to go out of your way to come here.", "author": "Sony L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-18", "description": "I work in the neighborhood and often order lunch to go from Nanatori. They have an awesome lunch special. Two rolls for $8.45. The two rolls also comes with a soup AND a salad. It's a great price for a sizable lunch in this neighborhood. The soup is a miso soup that comes in a plastic pint sized container and it's like miso soup from any other sushi restaurant. The salad comes with a ginger dressing. I always order two eel avocado rolls. I love eel and I don't eat raw fish so this is the most logical order choice for me. The rolls are tasty. The orders are made quick. The staff is friendly and will help you with whatever you ask for.\n\nIt's a good lunch choice.", "author": "S C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-22", "description": "I really like this place, the sushi pizza is awesome, I order from here about once a week. They have this awesome thing called sushi pizza (not what it sounds like) it's a fried tortilla, topped with some Japanese guacamole type mix, finished of with spicy tuna. It's freaking Amazing\n\nI also like the sex In the lobby roll (hate the name) its awesome. \n\nStaff are ok once they get to know you, it's pretty basic of a place but I think the sushi is 5 star", "author": "Katie J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-07", "description": "*** \u0026 1/2 stars.\n\nI mainly come here for lunch special. Their bento box is pretty good deal. I don't particularly like their rolls as they are  bland. Sushi and sashimi are OK but not great. Had noodles once and they were not good. Basically, another OK place in the area that caters to the lunch crowd.", "author": "Namik G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-30", "description": "Solid sushi option in my workplace vacinity - check. Fast service - check. Great prices - check. \n\nMy work friend and I were actually on our way to Tenda Sushi a couple weeks ago, but found this place first and decided to give it a try, since the prices and options were comparable and the restaurant was busy but not crowded. We opted for take out - the $8.95 two-roll lunch special - and were literally in and out in time to have a good 20 min of our lunch break left when we returned to the office (mind you we work about a 15 min walk away, in the downtown district). \n\nToday we actually decided to stay and eat, since the service was so fast. It was actually ridiculously fast once we sat down - our server was all business, and was right on top of everything. The only thing that took a bit long was waiting to get the check back after we gave her our cards... but otherwise everything was good and we got back to work only 15 min late *wink* due to our own laziness really lol. \n\nThis is a solid sushi option. I recommend the spicy tuna roll, and definitely get the lunch special if you're here in the afternoon. I'm glad Nanatori is within walking distance from work - it's a nice boring-day treat. :)", "author": "Elishevah G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-03", "description": "Last night was my second time going to Nanatori and I was impressed again.

It was extremely busy after the fireworks, as to be expected.  We were still seated within 10 minutes and served in a timely matter as well.  The food was amazing and again we didn't have to wait long at all!  From the tofu app to the amazing cuts of hamachi sashimi.

It can get crowded during lunch hours so it usually takes about 30 mins for your food to be served. If you go for dinner it is completely empty. The waitresses tend to rush you which is annoying.

I've experienced better\" perfectly describes by experience at Nantori. It was a conveniently located sushi spot that we stopped off on our way to a party. The service was good and the decor was ok, but nothing to rave over.\n\nAs far as the actual sushi, I have definitely had better. The shrimp tempura completely fell apart. The Philly tasted weird and not exactly fresh.\n\nIf you could go somewhere else, do so. If you're in the area, you should probably go somewhere else, unless you're really REALLY craving sushi. Otherwise, I say you're better off skipping this place.", "author": "Pavel K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-23", "description": "This is my favorite sushi restaurant to eat at, must try's are the miso soup, beef nagamoci, fried tempura ice cream, and the eel rows.

Nanatori gives me the fix I need sometimes.  There is a really HAPPY server there that makes smile on sight...He is just so happy!  Yes he screws up my order sometimes but his charisma makes up for it.\n\nI haven't had a roll here that I didnt love.  The beef Negamaki is bangin'!
