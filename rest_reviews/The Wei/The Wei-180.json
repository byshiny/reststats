Great, friendly service and clean spot. I got the steak, noodles, bok choi and green beans, and I devoured it. My husband got the catfish, green fried rice, bok choi and green beans and raved about it. Despite shoving our faces, neither of us feel disgusting after.

I had the mala spicy chicken, eggplant, and green beans with the jade rice. The chicken may look super spicy but it had just the right amount of kick. The vegetables were my favorite! It is a lot of food for a reasonable price. I also ordered a matcha bubble tea. I love places serve GOOD food and bubble tea. The staff there are very friendly! So happy to have found this gem in Brooklyn!", "author": "Samantha L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-15", "description": "A Chinese chipotle, except with more authentic Chinese food than your average American is used to. You got your base carb, protein, two veggie choices, and garnish. My first meal from here on this cold winter day was green fried rice, mapo tofu, eggplant and spicy radish; topped with pickled shallots. The spiciness of the tofu and eggplant were amazing and the flavor of the green fried rice was out of this world. Did I mention that they also serve bubble tea here? And it's pretty damn good.", "author": "Michael M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-30", "description": "I've ordered from The Wei within the first week that they opened, and I will most definitely keep coming back!

I appreciate that the food isn't too dumbed down and remains authentic tasting.  I've tried the Mala and market chicken, and the steak...they're all delicious along with the rice/noodles, veggies, and toppings.  It makes for a nice balanced meal.  Overall, a great addition to the area.", "author": "Ryan P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-08", "description": "Great service and atmosphere.

The flavors were very good and much, much, much more authentic-tasting than Panda Express. It seemed like all the ingredients were really fresh too. The string beans were great. My only complaints were it seemed a bit heavy and oily (well, what was I expecting ordering deep fried chicken and saut\u00e9ed eggplant...) and it seemed like it had been sitting out a while (it wasn't hot enough). Also, here's my list of unnecessary wishes: (1) I wish they had brown rice (even though I know that's generally not found in China) (2) please saut\u00e9 the eggplant better so it's less soggy (3) please use less breading and more chicken in the mala chicken.", "author": "R C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-09", "description": "Like others had mentioned, this is Chinese food version of Chipotle.  Food tastes better than those from typical wall in the hole Chinese joints, and the portion is generous.  I found myself a new option for dinner takeouts!", "author": "S H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-11", "description": "Totally affordable, straightforward Chinese food in the heart of downtown Brooklyn. \n\nVegetables were fresher than I've eaten at any Chinese restaurant. Noodles were perfectly balanced in flavor and texture. \n\nThis place offers an ordering system similar to Chipotle -- pick your protein, starch, veg. and garnish options. Looks to be a family-owned small business which I am always happy to support. \n\nPro tip: Try the bubble tea and pork.", "author": "Bobby D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "Chinese food chipotle style.
