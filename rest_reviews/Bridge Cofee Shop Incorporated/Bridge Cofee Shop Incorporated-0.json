Just down the street from my apt, so I like popping in here. Lots of cops hang out, so it feels very safe. My complaint is the extraordinarily odd hours they keep. Coffee is very weak too, so steer clear there. However, said coffee is made up for by the fact that they constantly have Mexican Coke in stock. Yay for sugar cane!!", "author": "Brooke Augusta W."}], "servesCuisine": "Food", "priceRange": null, "name": "Bridge Cofee Shop Incorporated", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "73 Bridge St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": null, "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17187970825"}
