I'm not a New Yorker so my pizza opinion isn't worth much but this was the best pizza I've ever had.\n\nThe sauce is simple, savory and sweet. The crust, well, the crust is perfect. And the cheese is the right balance or grease, melt, and thickness. \n\nIt's a small little shop in Brooklyn.

I was walking by and I smelled the pizza and went, I can go for a slice.  Walked in, looked at what was available and settled on a slice.  Got it, ate it, forgot it.  Not memorable at all, which means I won't come back.  So many other options around, i'll go check them out.  Side note, the employees that were working that day were super nice.", "author": "Justin C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-13", "description": "For about six months now, I've been eyeing Layla Jones but have yet to commit, until last night. Anyone in the Cobble Hill area likely knows this place smells FANTASTIC as you're passing by and it takes all your strength to keep walking past as you drag your feet to workout in the miserable 30 degree windy weather (No? Just me?).\n\nSo, yesterday I walked in before any crowds had arrived (I usually see a solid few families in here on weeknights -- it's a small place, maybe six-eight tables total) and found this place to be extremely cozy. Warm, dim lights, holiday decor, and that lovely pizza smell. I had a whole personal Sweet Lou's Lasagna pizza to myself (except that my boyfriend had to eat a solid 1/3 of it so we could finish) -- it has a meat sauce, tomato sauce, ricotta cheese and mozzarella. The crust was my favorite part. Kind of thick, a great texture, slightly crispy on the outside and perfect on the inside. I also really liked the sauce. The personal pizza is actually decently large, at four pretty big square slices.\n\nOnly a few people came in while we were there and everyone was ordering to-go (between 6-7pm), but they consistently had a LOT of orders they were leaving to deliver. Their menu states free delivery, so that's hard to beat.\n\nTheir menu also says they have a backyard area which I would have NEVER known from the front. I can't wait for warm weather so I can try it out! I only wish they had beer so I could have some pizza and beer on a warm summer day outside. Here's to hoping!\n\nOverall, a solid pizza option in the area. Not my #1, but I'd go again to try some more options and have a cozy, not-so-packed dinner.", "author": "Kaley R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-04-19", "description": "This restaurant is so good, I've had pizza, chicken cutlet, spaghetti and meatballs and they have all been delicious.

They have really really good pizza - I like to order the Farmers pizza with the sweet sausage or the Sweet Jane with onions and sweet sausage. Sweet Jane is probably my favorite.  Taking one star off only because every once in a while you'll get a cold bland pizza but almost all of the time it's great. I might order one tonight.", "author": "Rmr N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-06", "description": "Came into Layla Jones one Sunday evening for dinner and wow, great food and great pizza. We ordered a margherita pie to share and I had myself one of their CalJones! The pizza was top notch. Fresh ingredients, good sauce, fresh basil, good crust and good cheese. They got this one down right and better than the touristy pizza joints nearby. The CalJones is a calzone obviously but the way they do it was a bit different. It more shaped like a chicken roll but larger. They cover the outer top with cheese and bake it. The whole thing is very crunchy and crispy. It's a nice variation of a calzone. It almost reminds me of a chicken bake from Costco but just a million times better.\n\nService was also great. The waiter was very friendly. We sat outside in the back. It's a nice cozy little shindig. Tons of mosquitoes though. My legs and arse was chewed up by the time we left for Chip Shop. I would highly recommend Layla Jones and on Sunday, it was nice and quiet.

My go-to is the Sweet Jane pizza which has pesto, mozzarella and romano. I then add on pepperoni. I have never had a late delivery and my pizza is always still warm when it comes to me. I love the flavor of the sauce! For the large pizza (because I like leftovers) and a drink, it does seem to add up. With 20% tip my most recent order ended up being a little over $30, but there are 8 big slices of pizza which will give me a lot of tasty leftovers. \n\nI have never been inside the restaurant so I can not review how the wait service is or how the Restruant looks, but delivery wise it has been flawless.", "author": "Chelsea D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-15", "description": "After one hour we checked the phone and saw someone texted (TEXTED?) \"delivery\" 2 minutes prior. We called back twice and it seemed he didn't want to come to the door but finally he came in as we held the buzzer for 30 seconds. The pizza looks and tastes like when you go to a slice place and the pie has been hanging out at room temp for an hour or more with pretty dry cheese. \n\nBummed to leave this review because we order all the time but it's been too many times over the past year that the overall service and food has gone down hill.", "author": "Robyn H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-02-16", "description": "Solid pizza,  quick delivery, nice people.", "author": "James Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-03", "description": "Delicious unique and affordable. Very good especially for only $5 for two slices and a drink at lunch. Crust is light and airy while still having great flavor.

Everything about their pizza is awesome from the soft, but crispy crust to their delicious sauce. They don't overdo it with the cheese either and there's little to no grease. It's certainly not one of those slices you'll have to use a tissue to pat down. Another bonus is their lunch special; you can get two plain slices and a soda or water for just $5. Finding affordable food, especially in Brooklyn Heights/Downtown Brooklyn can be a tough task sometimes, so this deal is much appreciated. You'll probably never read about Layla Jones on Eater or some other website like that, but trust me this place  serves some of Brooklyn's best pizza.

I think the concept of a square slice makes me feel like I'm about to eat a child's bland boring pizza, and therefore always kept me away. Thanks to a fellow yelper Kenny, he said I gotta try a slice! And boy am I glad I did. They do a deal for a plain cheese slice and a soda for a couple bucks. I'm not a plain cheese guy though, how will I be able to enjoy a near naked SQUARE slice?! All my red flags were signaled, until that first super crispy corner bite. DAMN. If eating a square slice makes me a child, call me Baby Boy Blue. esh. Ok, I'm in love with this slice. I legit crave a slice now EVERY TIME I WALK BY! Seriously, every damn time.

The pies that came from Layla Jones were definitely the crowd favorite. It's all about that perfectly crispy crust.
