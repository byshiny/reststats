What the hell is wrong with me???????????? \n\nI have decided to make this sandwich my official sponsor.....not sure how the folks down at Hanco's will receive that info ....but ummmm yeah \nMe and my bestestest friend ever DNC decided to try this place out and see what the Bahn Mi hype is all about. \n\nWe ordered the classic and the pork chop sandwich (medium heat). I am trying to increase my spice tolerance but I felt spicy was too much for me..he on the other hand looooves spice but true to his bestestet friend title decided he would add the heat on at the table...via the bottles of liquid fire AKA sriracha. \n\nI took my first bite and I was hooked. Man oh man this stuff is great!!! The pickled veggies add the sweet and coolness for a heat punk such as myself. \n\nAs some other reviewers stated it is kind of constructed in an odd way with the meat to the back so I had to open it up and re-modify it so that each bite was a perfect one. \n\nI also ordered the lemonade and we split a Vietnamese iced coffee which is so strong and yummy I could drink it everyday. \nI am going to use this experience as a start to my Vietnamese food world tour (with DNC my man going each and every place with a banh mi in my hand) \n\nAnyway I need to go mentally relive this experience so umm yeah go already!", "author": "Quana C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-20", "description": "My brother recommended Hanco's (the other location technically - but I wasn't sitting down to eat anyway) and I gotta say he was on point. I had the Veggie Pork sandwich, extra spicy, and it didn't disappoint.

And I know my banh mi. I ordered the pork sandwhich. First the bread: its some weird hoagie roll and not a baguette. Condiments: they use regular jar mayonnaise- no spicy garlic mayo at Hanco's. Meat: the pork was underseasoned and seemed to be steamed and not grilly. The pork was also very fatty and tendony and because of the way it was cooked it wasnt a pleasant sensory experience. I had to take some of the meat out because it was that bad. Extras: Theyre light on the cilantro, give tons of carrot but not much daikon. All in all I was very underwhelmed. The ratio of meat to bread was wrong with way too much unpleasant pork to hoagie bread; so much so that the bread got super soggy and not in a good way.\n\nIf you have never had banh mi  before please go somewhere else like Paris Sandwhich or Saigon or really anywhere else in Chinatown. If you are on the hood and MUST have a sandwhich go to Nicky's.", "author": "Anastasia T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-10", "description": "I'm not a sandwich person but I would eat their sandwiches here anytime.

And yet my gut insists that this must be a special place, or at least a special local chain. I cherish the chicken bahn mi: fresh bread, crisp daikon, juicy chicken...and a super-sweet Vietnamese iced coffee is a perfect way to wash it down.

Spicy. I don't usually do a bubble tea as I like to pair it with a somewhat spicy ginger beer/ale from the deli on the corner.\nNow, if I am the mood to get my \"pork\" on, I like the 'classic' at Nickys better. I prefer the taste of their meat and the bread at Nickys and Hancos seems to be a bit heavy handed with the vegetables.\n\nAs an aside, when I think back to the Smith street of the late-90's, I am sure I would have never imagined that one day my biggest problem would be deciding which Vietnamese sandwich shop I liked the best.", "author": "Rich B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-03", "description": "Nom Nom Nom\n\nExcuse me while I stuff my face with the most delicious pork chop sandwich and wash it down with a refreshing taro bubble tea. \n\nI walked by this block so many times and I never saw this place.
