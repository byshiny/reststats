The BBQ food wasn't the best. I mean how do you say you're a BBQ place but do not have mac and cheese or mashed potatoes. Besides that, the drinks were GREAT. Nice place to grab a drink with a friend. Just don't expect the food to be any true southern BBQ.", "author": "Brittany N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-18", "description": "This place sucked!

My last visit is the reason for the current one star review. I ordered the ribs, shrimp and \"steak\" special. The ribs and shrimp we're ok but the \"steak\" turned out to be liver. Couldn't believe they had the gall to serve liver and not expect one to notice. Didn't expect a high quality steak for that deal but serving liver is just next level dishonesty; I grew up eating liver and have nothing against it really but it's not what I ordered. Asked my waiter about this and he referred me to the manager then the manager assured me that I was not served liver...the very liver still on my plate as I spoke to him. This was infuriating and definitely one of the worst dinning experiences of my life.", "author": "Dre S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-06", "description": "I tried to have lunch here. I was seated in a section and a waitress never came over to help us. I spoke to the hostess, who did not seem to understand anything. She asked me if I wanted a different seat and I informed her that I would like to sit in any seat that would allow me to order lunch. I sat for another 5 minutes and still no service. I had lunch elsewhere and will never return to this location.

I ordered the taco salad and essentially paid $10 for a bowl iceberg lettuce. It didn't even come with the sour cream as advertised and when I asked for a side of sour cream to decrease friction between leaves, I got two little packets of sour cream. Also, they don't have a dessert menu", "author": "Ivey J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-20", "description": "I have been working in Downtown Brooklyn for two years or so already and I've never had the opportunity to try out this Dallas BBQ location until last month. We were initially going to do a birthday dinner at Dinosaur BBQ, but due to overbooking we had to quickly decide on another restaurant in Brooklyn that would take a party of 10-12 and served barbecue, so we ended up at Dallas BBQ. \n\nThe wait was around 20-40 minutes. I must say this isn't the best Dallas BBQ I've been to because it was loud, rowdy, and super crowded not to mention it was a Friday night. After a 20-40 minute wait, we were finally seated and after deciding what we wanted, our waiter took our order.\n\nWe ordered two type of wings to share. The only type of wings I remember we had was the Hennesey wings which were quite delicious! The wings were jumbo- size. They were slightly sweet like honey, meaty, hot, and full of flavor. This was a good pick.\n\nFor entr\u00e9e, I asked for the Pulled Pork \u0026 Brisket Special. It is supposed to come with bread, but I asked for it without bread (trying to cut some carbs). I got the special with a side of fries and coleslaw. The pulled pork was moist and tasty, but there was something a little offsetting about the brisket. The texture of the brisket felt very odd. It wasn't moist nor dry, but weird.  The fries were slightly crisp and soft. Coleslaw was okay. \n\nAfter we finished our entrees, our waiter brought out a plate of corn muffins with a green frosting (green for St. Patricks Day) and did a whole Happy Birthday theme for us. How delightful!\n\nThe dining experience at Dallas BBQ wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The only complaints I have really is the texture of the brisket was off putting and the loud and rowdiness. I very much like the Dallas BBQ's in the city, they are more friendlier and not as loud or rowdy.  I don't think I would come back because this was really just a last resort/last minute decision since we couldn't get a table at Dinosaur BBQ.", "author": "Jessica D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-21", "description": "Place was extra crowded. I love the drinks here. I ordered the seafood combo and Henny wings. I wish we they would bottle the Henny sauce and sell it. It's amazing. The crab cake were good but small. The shrimp was good. I would recommend this place.", "author": "Tajuana W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-22", "description": "The hours for this place were wrong on here; and bc it said they closed at 10 we weren't planning to go there. We happened to walk by it anyway and it says it's open till 12am. \nWe were seated right away even though they were busy. Our drink orders were on the table before we knew what we wanted. Their mixed drinks are potent and that was awesome. If you're going to pay between 8-16$ for a drink it better be strong. \nWe ordered the beef ribs since I don't eat pork and it's rare to find beef ribs at a BBQ spot. They were tender and delicious, the sauce was so good.  Much better than the vinegary sauce that's in the bottle on the table. \nWe also ordered the chicken and savory waffles, which were sticky goodness. \n\nWe spent about $60 (tip is automatically included and included taxes) for dinner and drinks for two people but the portions were large and the drinks potent - absolutely worth it to us. \n\nDownside- this place is stadium level loud but that is entirely on the patrons. People were clearly having a good time with friends which is nice, but so GD loud that they drown out the music and anyone else trying to talk. \n\nI only wish there was karaoke for the late night crowd.

If you are a hungry wolf, this is the place to go. I came here for take-out. For ~$16, you can get a big box of ribs, chicken and baked potato along with corn bread and a tiny cute cupcake, which can almost feed two people. However, the taste is not ideal - the BBQ sauce it serves is way too sweet, which overwhelms the nice taste of the meat. The sides are decent and filling.", "author": "Shen Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "We were seated as soon as we walked in. Bianca was a great waiter. She constantly checked on us and make sure we had everything we needed. Our drinks and food came out in a timely fashion. The drinks was wonderful. I don't know if it's me but I think the Texas size drinks are getting smaller. The food was good, we weren't really hungry so we shared a 10 piece fried chicken. If you want great customer service and a waiter that checks on and make sure you're good, ask to sit in Bianca section.
