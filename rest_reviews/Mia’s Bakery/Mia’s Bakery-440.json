I went in not sure if I was going to get anything and ended up ordering 2. I got the coconut eclair and the tiramisu - both of which I'd highly recommend. My friends all raved about their choices as well (red velvet cupcake, carrot cake, and chocolate chip cheesecake). If you want coffee they have that covered as well. \n\nThey have wifi so it's a great place to study if it isn't too crowded.

When we informed the workers, they immediantly refunded our purchases and gave us a whole pie free of charge!

I was planning on going to Juniors in Brooklyn to get a slice of cheesecake for $3.00. The weather was horrible and I didn't want to get caught in the rain so I decided to give Mia's Bakery on Smith Street a chance. The staff was very welcoming and the bakery is beautiful inside. I mentioned when I walked in that today was NC Day and that cheese cake slices are $3.00. They weren't aware of the holiday however they were kind enough to sell me slices for $3.00. I bought 4 and was given a free one. I bought one of each kind. They were all really good. They aren't as large as Junior's but are very tasty. I'll be back!", "author": "Keisha P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-01", "description": "Definitely my favorite spot in the neighbourhood when its time to indulge in some sweetness.

There wasn't flavor to the cake itself; the strawberries were nice and sweet, ofcourse.\n\nI was hopeful upon entering the bakery...the place was lovely and clean...the attendant was kind and helpful...but the cake was disappointing. Hopefully their other goods are yummy, but I'm not sure I'd go back...", "author": "Joy S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-26", "description": "Ordered a cake from here during the 2017 winter time for my sons birthday which i pre-ordered. When I arrived they told me they had no more bags to hold the cake, after watching customers walk out with bags. The sidewalk was encrusted with slippery ice. I asked if they had anything and expressed my concerns. I didn't want to perform a balancing act while holding a cake box. The manager walks over, whispers something into the ear of the nice woman who helped me with my order from start to finish. If you are going to charge $40 for a cake, dont make your judgement on people who come into your store so obvious and force your employees to comply. I happened to make several stops on smith street and as I passed by MIA's again, there are customers walking out with bags again?!?!?!?, this was 15 minutes after i had left. Sure enough the worst happened , balancing act came to a halt as i succumbed to the ice on the sidewalk around the corner. The cake was beyond repair, but i was more concerned about my ankle. Had family pick me up and take me to a local Urgent Care. Got back to the house. My son looks at me and says, dont worry dad, I love you, lets go hands in on this cake!. It was a unique moment despite the pain in my ankle and anger I felt toward the establishment. Some of these new places do not know who people are in the neighborhood. The cake was pretty good, but neither I or the two dozen others who responded to me when I had the accident will ever order from this place based on the merit of MIA's poor management and customer interaction. I had cake, I ate it too, and you get a 2 for stereotyping 1.", "author": "Sean D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-06", "description": "I'm not a big fan of sweet but I do like this place.
