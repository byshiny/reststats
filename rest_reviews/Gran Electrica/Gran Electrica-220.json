They had a sign outside for National Taco Day , I think. We were greeted by a nice hostess and we were given the choice of dining outside which was a perfect decision. \n\nThe outside dining area is so nice.\n\nWe were bought menus and we quickly ordered two beers and guacamole which was so good and I love the thickness and texture of the chips. The two sauces that are put on the table were amazing. We especially loved the red.\n\nI ordered the fried yucca and scallops. I guess I was hoping for bigger portions and for the scallops to be cooked. I wasn't expecting them to be prepared and served ceviche style.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Mussels Quesdilla which was delicious, a little hard to cut through and once again small. He has a huge appetite and was a little disappointed. He also ordered the rice which was so disappointing. I'm not sure if the rice they used was even long grain. I didn't like the flavor. For 5 dollars and a small dish of bland rice, i was upset. \n\nI had to give 3 stars because the ambience was so nice but the portions so small. However, I would come back again if I want drinks, guacamole and yucca.", "author": "Amber C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-29", "description": "I wish I could give it 3.5, because it does deserve that. The service was good; they gracefully accommodated a party of 12 even though our reservation was for 8. So good on them.\n\nAmbiance is great, especially if you can get a table in their back garden. Good for groups or a date, very romantic and intimate. Drinks are great. We had:\n\nWhole fish (wonderful)\nSopes de carne adobada (ok, not spectacular)\nAlbondigas (very good)\nSuaderos tacos (good)\n\nThe highlight, though, were the desserts. Totally surprised us. The flan might be one of the best I've ever had, and the chocolate pudding was fantastic. Churros and tres leches were good, but not as good as the others.", "author": "Seisei T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-05", "description": "Ugh, my experience here was pretty awful. We sat outside and in sum, it was loud, hot, slow, and uncomfortable. \n\nIt was a busy night and there were a ton of children, so that's what made it so loud. Because of the way the buildings ar,e and the fence is, around the outdoor space, its really impossible to feel any draft. \n\nAnnoyingly (!?) there are a lot of ways the restaurant could improve the experience. They should consider getting some fans. The service was pretty slow, and since we were kind of eager to leave pretty soon after sitting down, it wasn't cute. \n\nTheir chairs are insanely uncomfortable. We sat along the edges of the space, where one side sits on a bench, and the other sits on chairs. The bench is too high for the table (knees touch the table) and the chairs are too low for the table. Unbelievable...?\n\nThe menu immediately reminded me of La Esquina's, but the food was much worse. \n\nI wouldn't go back again, for so many reasons.", "author": "Andrea Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-04-21", "description": "Came here on Friday Night. It was peak happy hour and we had a party of 8 so our wait was 40 minutes. Not a big deal so we hung out at the bar. That's where the problems started.\n\nPositives: The Chips, Salsa \u0026 Guac was good. Very tasty. They replenish the chips frequently so that was nice. \n\nNegatives: The food was meh. My pork was super chewy. My friend's chicken was super dry. The margaritas were good but are too expensive at $12.00 for a whisky tumblr size serving. Lobo in Carroll Gardens (not exactly a cheap place to live either) has double the size margs for $15.00. \n\nHuge Negative: Because we were standing at the bar and it was sort of crowded, we were sandwiched in between the side of the bar and two high top tables. The space was limited but we didn't have a choice. As a result, at one point, I turned around to go to the bathroom and bumped a waitress. I said \"oh sorry about that.\" Her response: \"Okay. Maybe it's not obvious that the kitchen is there (points to door) and there are tables back there (points to back of restaurant) but I need to do my job.\"\n\nI'll give it three stars for the food/drinks but knock it a star for the not-so-friendly waitress.", "author": "Nate P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-09", "description": "Beautiful decor, great outdoor patio, really great sonic branding with the musical selections, amazing guacamole with pineapple in it, and decent fish tacos.

Service was excellent, our waiter made sure to tell us about the special and the low price on it; we didn't order it, but it sounded great. \n\nThis will become my go-to whenever I'm in Dumbo and need a drink, some nice ambiance and a few good Mexican bites.\n\nTry the shrimp tostaditos, although for $11 they could give you 3 instead of 2, they are still one of the better small bites I have had here.", "author": "Cyrus P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-25", "description": "Came here during happy hour --\u00a0the margaritas and plantains here are really scrumptious.

We really wanted to love this place, as we're always on the lookout for Mexican spots within walking distance from our apartment.\n\nFinally made it to Gran Electrica and our hopes were high. We were seated promptly (had a reservation on a Saturday night, and the place seemed reasonably busy) by a friendly host, so off to a good start. But from there, it really went downhill. Our server took maybe 20 minutes to bring us water and take a drink order. We skipped the margaritas (although maybe that was our fatal error! I've heard they're awesome) and went for wine -- it was watery and just...not good. Two glasses of wine took about 15 minutes to get to our table. Ordered guac, salsa, and chips. Guac was fresh but so, so, so bland...we actually sprinkled table salt on it to get a bit of flavor. Same with the chips. Salsa was watery and flavorless. Like a mildly spicy tomato soup. We then went for chicken tacos, veggie tacos, and a mixed salad. Tacos were t-i-n-y and mediocre...salad was maybe the best part of the meal.\n\nThroughout dinner, service was friendly but exceedingly slow. That would've been fine, if the food had been stellar, but it just wasn't. Maybe Gran Electrica was having an off night, or maybe (because the ambiance is great) it's just a better spot for a few drinks rather than a full sit-down meal.", "author": "Katie E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-01", "description": "The guac and chips.

Despite a seemingly empty restaurant front on Sunday afternoon, we were led to a quaint sunbathed backyard. In the words of my companion: \"This feels like the a neighborhood backyard picnic\".\n\nWe managed to squeeze in the last brunch orders - they serve brunch until 3pm and we managed to put in our order a bit after 2:30pm. As an avid bruncher, I'd say this place is charming due to its casual laid back vibes and attentive but down-to-earth staff. If you're looking for a lazy Sunday brunch, Mexican-inspired egg options and some strong tequila-enfused cocktails, this is the place for you!\n\nWe had the Chilaquiles which was hearty but slightly too rich toward the end of our meal. The Huervos Rancheros had a great balanced roasted tomato salsa base. In terms of the cocktails, if you're not a fan of super-sweet cocktails and looking for an alternative from the typical Bloody Mary, the Margarita de Toronja Picante was on point.

We even took the in laws there but slowly noticed after 3-4 times that food was just going downhill.\n\nAtmosphere is GREAT and cozy. It's right next to Grimaldi's if all else fails. The last time we went back two weeks ago, there were some hairs in the tacos and the fish in the tacos tasted like soap. We split three orders of tacos and had two drinks and the bill was close to $75.
