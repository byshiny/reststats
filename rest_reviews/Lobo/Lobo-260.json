No way. Does it hit the spot when I need it to the point where we come here at least every other week? Yes. The margaritas alone are worth the trip. Fresh juice, people- all the goodness, none of the mix, less of a headache the next day! I love me a classic lime margarita, but their special margaritas are awesome too. Food-wise: totally decent guac. Not the best I've ever had, but to me, pretty-good guac is better than no guac. My boyfriend loves the chipotle shrimp tacos. I often get the shrimp entree with tequila sauce. Sides include things like fried pickles (mmm), rice \u0026 beans, sauteed spinach, creamed corn, and garlic mashed potatoes (double mmm). Also: their mac \u0026 cheese is OFF THE HOOK. I also love the queso dip. Really tasty brunch too! Go for the margaritas, the cute ambiance, \u0026 good service; don't have huge expectations for the food \u0026 you won't be disappointed. I'm glad to have Lobo in my 'hood.

Sure, the food won't knock your clogs off like some other places on Smith and Court, but it is easy to get a table of any size, there are plentiful chips and salsa, and the margaritas are really tasty. I would recommend the burrito, if you're a vegetarian.", "author": "Amy R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-09-25", "description": "A friend was visiting from Florida and we decided this would be a great place to go for a quick bite to eat. It had really great seating in the back, a really cute garden but the food is not the best Mexican I've had, (and i'm from CT). Also they only accept cash, but the ATM they had upstairs would not work for my card.

Our server could not explain a pungent peanut butter odor and taste in my fiancee's entree and volunteered to be of no further assistance on the matter. Weird. Drinks were lovely but you pay a premium for 'em.

Now, transformed into Lobos with cheesy Tex-Mex decor (not even good cheesy, just lame cheesy... like American cheese, not smoked Gouda or something tasty like that), it's the place to avoid - at least for food. I think the bar is probably decent. Having just come back from a trip to Mexico, I realize I'm having withdrawals for an authentic enchilada, but Lobos' version of this, or a burrito, or even a taco is embarrassingly bad! As a veg, I have heard that a few of the carne options are OK, but nothing to brag about. And while they promised to preserve the original brunch menu, they even botched that up. A sad mourning for the loss of a good Cobble Hill eatery (sigh).", "author": "Dan B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-23", "description": "Really, really wanted to love this place (they have Migas!), but was seriously disappointed.  The Margaritas were pretty good, and the queso was spot on Tex Mex (velveeta and rotel!), but the main dishes were awful. The tostadas were soggy and both the rice and the refried beans were bland, bland, bland. The salsa and chips were fine, but tasted like they'd come out of a bag. All in all, not worth the price or the time. Nice people though.", "author": "Michele W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-25", "description": "I've been in the neighborhood for about a month now and had not yet found a decent Mexican place.  I decided to go there after ordering take out over the phone.  Once I got there, the ambiance was good so I decided to stay and eat there. They had no problem with bringing out a real plate for me to sit down with.  I had ordered a beer and before I had even taken a sip, I spilled it and broke the glass.  But the bartender just laughed it off and got me another. Here is the kicker: I tried to pay for the second one but she wouldn't let me. To take a potentially embarrassing moment for me and turn it into such a positive was great and something you don't expect.  The burrito was big and delicious and the guacamole was fresh. It came with a small salad and chips and salsa also.

One day my friend and i decided to try it out because we wanted maxican food. We were squished in the front by the window; was'nt a very comfortable experience.

They serve a mean margarita, make some fantastic fish tacos and service during non-weekend-peak-hours is very good.  I've become a bit of a regular there lately, so getting the bill has become less shocking.  Be careful with the drinks, they add up quickly.  But otherwise, everything is reasonably priced.

Served every day, Lobo brunch is a staple of my brunching.  The breakfast tacos (with chorizo, side of sour cream) and the Texas breakfast (buckwheat/pecan pancakes!) are both delicious.

With her southern expertise and having had Texas Tex-Mex, I usually hold her to her word. Now, having been to Tey-has myself recently, I've experienced great Tex-Mex (see my review of Chueys....oh my god) and I feel I can speak with some sense of \"authority\". So, Lobo was okay.
