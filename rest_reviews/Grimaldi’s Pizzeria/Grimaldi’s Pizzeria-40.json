If you enjoy garlic, the garlic pizza topping is a must. While the crust is perfect (coal fired crust done to perfection), the sauce is lacking in flavor. The cheese/sauce ratio favors sauce, but if you prefer it this way you may enjoy their pizza.", "author": "Mr P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-12-25", "description": "The gang and I decided to meet up at the infamous Grimaldi's that's actually located inside the Limelight which formerly was a disco/rock club and before that, a church. \n\nSince we were 5 gals, we decided to order upgrade and order 2 large pizzas (only $2 more a pie!) We went with a white pie (garlic sauce) with pesto, bacon and ricotta cheese and another large pepperoni. Probably took 20 minutes to hit the table.\n\nThe pepperoni crust was really crispy, but I felt like pepperoni itself were really thin and salty. The sauce wasn't anything to brag about. However, the white pizza was realllllly good. The only con I thought was the crust was a little soggy probably because of the ricotta cheese. We probably should have went easy on the extra cheese, but it was still really good.\n\nBetween the 5 of us, we were only left with 2 slices. I think we got a lot accomplished. The end results, I'm usually the type to pick a pepperoni over a white pizza, but I really like the taste of the white over the pepperoni. Even though I like the crust on the pepperoni over the white, that garlic sauce was so good that I had to pick it over better the red sauce. I think Jezelle was the only one that actually liked the pepperoni over the white. Overall score, I would give this a solid 5 out of 8 slices.", "author": "Maria E."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2019-02-05", "description": "My boyfriend and I were trying to walk to the Brooklyn Bridge Park after crossing the bridge. It sounds so stupid to say but we got lost due to the inaccuracy of Google and Apple maps =.= Luckily, while crossing the street, a nice local lady asked if we needed help cause we looked so lost. She helped guide us to the park and on our way there, she suggested Grimaldi's. First off, we had to try NY style pizza while in town and second, she was hyping this place so much that we had to give it a try. \n\nUpon arrival, we waited around 5 minutes in the cold to be seated. Smaller parties get seated quicker. It is a family owned restaurant and they accept cash only. You can customize your pizza with sauces and a variety of toppings. I do have to say, it's a little pricey but you're also paying for the quality and freshness of the ingredients. This place was worth the money and experience.

Good not great. Good and surely not worth the $$. a small pizza with toppings cost us $37. We came from Seattle and this place came highly recommended from blogs and reviews.

It's often very busy, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. Thankfully they have quite a bit of room across a couple different levels and they make very efficient use of the space.\n\nThe main event does not disappoint; soft and chewy crust topped with excellent, fresh toppings. Service is typical New York so I had no issues with that; the only reason they don't get five stars is because they do not take credit cards. In 2018 I don't understand how cash-only is still a thing.\n\nStop at an ATM and buckle in for tasty pizza!", "author": "Warren D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-12-02", "description": "Housed in an old bank building, the ambiance of the place screams \"We've been here for a while and we know how to do it right\". Old posters, framed pictures, and clippings clutter the walls, capturing the history of the establishment. The pizza itself is fresh-a bit underseasoned for my tastes, but comes out piping hot and satisfyingly crispy. The edges, to my disappointment, were slightly charred on the bottom-more than one would expect from even a brick oven. Its good, but not completely blow your mind; the place is also cash-only.  A line starts forming soon around opening hours, so I would recommend you arrive a little beforehand so you don't need to wait. Overall plusses are a decent pie, and the line is less long than the pizza place around the corner.", "author": "Albert W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2019-03-02", "description": "Everyone knows this place is the best.

Both my cousin and I had read about this place and where excited to try it out!\nThere was a line here all day but it went super quick and we were seated within 10-15 min. Definitely a tourist trap, but hey who cares we were tourists and loved it! We were seated in the upstairs area that looked out over the entrance and kitchen area, so we could see the zas being made!\nWe ordered a large half cheese, half peperoni pizza, which came out pretty quick. I wasn't quite sure what to expect as this type of pizza is very different from the Chicago Deep Dish I am used to, but I was very impressed. The crust is thin and crispy, cheese delicious, and the mini pepperonis were soo yummy-my fav part. We ate the entire pizza!\nThe staff was wonderful-you could tell most of them had worked there for a long time and were very proud of their restaurant. They even brought us out a huge cannoli to share between the 3 of us and it was heavenly.\nSome tips: They do only take cash, so be prepared for that. Food was priced very reasonably as well. Also, no alcoholic drinks. \nIf you are exploring near the Brooklyn Bridge, definitely check out this awesome pizza place!", "author": "Melissa D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-11-11", "description": "Pros\nArea, ambiance its right under the bridge its a great date spot\ngreat flavors\nthin crust\nbrick oven pizza\n\n\nCons\nLONG WAIT (dine in or take our doesn't matter you have to wait online to get in the building)\ncash only\nyou can only buy it by the Pie.... super downside", "author": "Keyawnia R."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-06", "description": "I love Grimaldi's.  It's basic and delicious pizza.  I have eaten here three times (mind you I travel to NYC for business so this is a lot of visits).  It's hand tossed, thin pizza with fresh toppings.  I haven't had to wait more than a minute or two for a table.  It's always recommended by New Yorkers.  For that I give it a 4 star.  \n\n-0.5 Star it's CASH ONLY!  They do have an ATM in the restaurant.  \n\n-0.5 Star no wine or beer served.  For 3 years they have had a sign saying they are in the process of getting a liquor license.  This place has been around forever.  I cannot understand why this hasn't happened in 3 years.
