We can't give them a try any longer :/@\n\nThe prices are too high for a \"non organic menu\" - also the biggest issue is with the delivery crew. Every time we have ordered, they don't even try the buzzer and they call us, then speak in 100% Spanish and we can't understand anything that they are saying (I wish I spoke fluent Spanish but I don't). We then have to call the restaurant and explain that they need to buzz in, then meanwhile the food is getting cold etc..\n\nI have no problem with the fact that English is not their first language, it's more that they don't even try to use the buzzer. We live in a very secure building and they simply MUST buzz in for us to open the door. There's no other way to let them in and we shouldn't have to take the elevator down because they aren't trained properly. The directions are clearly written on the directory. Their delivery crew either doesn't even try to use the buzzer OR has no idea how to. It's not their fault, but it is the responsibility of the restaurant manager to hire the right staff, or properly train people, this is a fundamental requirement of any NY restaurant.  \n\n4/4 times we have ordered from here this has happened. We are done.", "author": "S L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-08", "description": "I have no idea how I should start this review. This place was incredible!! I am a sucker for good Mediterranean food and this place made my taste buds tingle. I was more focused on the food rather than layout but I did look around and like the placement of the tables, wall decorations, and I like the bathrooms. The bread was probably the thing that impressed me the most surprisingly, I was  stocking up soo much carbs before my penne vodka was ready. The spinach/cheese rolls, falafel calamari were all spot on. *Keep in mind I came with a group for a birthday dinner*  I did regret getting pasta when I could've had the kabob or the stew two of my friends had which did taste better than my pasta. I definitely will come back to this place, my friends and I already agreed on it. Can't wait to come back :)", "author": "Shahin G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-23", "description": "Delicious dips! Get the mixed appetizer people! It includes nice spreads like humus and babaganoush. Really great way to start the meal. The picture is of the special Beyti kebab: I got the one with chicken and it is wrapped in a delicious lavash bread and topped with a garlic yogurt sauce. Also it is served with tasty rice. It is fantastic and goes great with their homemade hot sauce! It is affordable and delicious food.

Here you don't have to choose, they're both excellent. The same goes for the chicken. I'm not crazy about their baba ganoush, but you can't have a Mediterranean buffet without it either.

It's a pretty large restaurant well suited for big groups with a number of sidewalk tables during the warmer months. They also have a large bar for drinks or if you're waiting for a take out order! The menu offers many Mediterranean appetizers (hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves), salads, and entrees (chicken and lamb gyros and kabobs, falafel, seafood). Favorite picks: chicken and lamb gyro, hummus appetizer, and chocolate souffl\u00e9! The service is prompt and friendly and the prices are commensurate with the neighborhood. They also provide catering options and host private parties (up to 100 people).", "author": "Amanda B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-11", "description": "I have an unstoppable love affair with the mixed appetizer plate.

The food is meh and overpriced, though I'm guessing that the rent is expensive in this sought after pocket of Fort Greene and the owners have to recoup profits somehow.\n\nI had the mixed meat grill which is $20. It comes with chicken gyro, chicken shish kebab, lamb shish and adana (kafta) kebab served with rice and salad. The chicken kebab was well marinated and moist and the rice was very good--it had kind of an almondy taste to it. The yogurt sauce was liquidy and had no flavor. All of the other meats were just okay. I didn't even bother taking my leftovers home.\n\nService here is fine and this is a nice place to sit outside and people watch. The food, though?

Needing to sober up from a day of drinking which started at noon I came to Deniz in the middle of the Crossing Brooklyn Ferry festival at BAM. Figured it was a good option to fill up but I needed more that just that. I also needed a iPhone 5 charger. \n\nI come barreling in, screaming about an iPhone 5 charger and if they accept credit card. They assured me, they could help me with both issues and sat me away from anywhere I could scare anyone. I stare at the menu for awhile and contemplate what I should have. Something filling, which can get me through the night. Stuffed cabbage it is! Now I know what you want to ask me, \"Mitch you we're pretty bombed. Can I trust your opinion of the food?\" Well I have only one thing to say. How dare you question me! I may have been drunk, but I've been drunk and not enjoyed my meal before. The stuffed cabbage was excellent and I'll stand by that. \n\nAfter devouring my meal, I paid, got my charged iPhone and was ready to rage some more. Thank you Deniz, you saved me.

The food came hot and packaged very well. The Deniz Salad is huge, all of the veggies were very fresh and the dressing was simple and yummy. The \"feta cheese\" though was actually just a very finely shredded cheese that tasted more like cojita. \n\nThe lentil soup was good, but tasted a little heavy. The ingredients on the menu just say \"pur\u00e9ed red lentils topped with crushed red pepper and mint.\" I couldn't taste the red pepper or mint.... Just really lentils and some kind of cream. I wound up calling and asking what was in it... They told me it was vegetarian but had dairy, and when I asked what kind of dairy he said \"butter.\" Umm gross. \n\nI won't be ordering the soup again. But that won't stop me from trying some more salads. And the best part, it came with two huge pieces of warm Turkish bread.

I ordered the Adana kebab and a side of hummus. Both were good although I felt the kebab was a bit overpriced for the portion.
