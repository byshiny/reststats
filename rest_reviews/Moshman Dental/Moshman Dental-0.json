I have been a client for years and would be hard pressed to go anywhere else. I've had everything done from fillings to root canals. They do the job professional and keep you in the loop all the way through the procedures. I recently had some cosmetic bonding done by Dr. Bowers, and the results where absolutely beautiful!
