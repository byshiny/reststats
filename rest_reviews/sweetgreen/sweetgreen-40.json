The store itself is bright and makes you feel like you just stepped into a great vibe due to the openness.\n\nThe food is good and the staff is very friendly. I had the guacamole green salad and it was very refreshing and appetizing. The avocado and the lime jalape\u00f1o vinaigrette is a nice touch. \n\nThe drinks are light and flavorful as well. I have the cucumber, lime, and ginger drink and this is one of my favorites. I can drink this all day and feel refreshed.\n\nCome out and visit this location then stop over at the Brooklyn bridge park when you're done.", "author": "Martin V."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-11", "description": "overpriced salad... but you get it anyway cause there aren't a lot of food options in dumbo...", "author": "Susan P."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-02", "description": "Have loved sweetgreen since they were just their tiny Georgetown flagship.

If no one stands at the beginning of the salad counter, how can I know that I should stand there while dozens of employees are hanging around? Mid-way between the beginning of the line and the cashier, the salad lady asked me to walk back to order (no one was behind me) while mumbling to her colleagues her dissatisfaction with my ignorance; needless to say I walked out instead.

The interior design is pretty good.\n\nI've ordered from here, either in person or online, about 15 times so far.  Things I *don't* like about Sweetgreen:\n1. If you don't order online, it's a pretty long line and the staff make mistakes sometimes (but this may get better after they've been open for a while).\n2. They don't take cash.  This should be illegal -- this is the USA, I should be free to purchase food without having an intermediating institution (like a bank or credit card) involved.", "author": "George S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-26", "description": "First time here. I must say the staff are amazing and very helpful. Such a friendly environment. Very clean. The food is so good.  The Guacamole Greens salad is...wow!

I'm hoping that this is just because they are a new location because so far it's definitely not up to Sweetgreen standards. There's hardly anything in my salad besides lettuce and dressing. I think the management needs to make sure the employees who are new to the Sweetgreen family understand that the company's culture is one of generosity and community. I don't see that reflected here yet.", "author": "Nicole S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-03", "description": "The food is definitely tasty, but it is too expensive to  consistently leave out dressing if they're running low or to skimp on components such as protien or even greens.

I was stoked to try out the DUMBO Sweetgreen.\n\nUnfortunately, ALL the other negative reviews are right: the workers clearly hate being there, refuse to make eye contact, and ignore you as you're waiting in line even though there are four to five people standing around doing absolutely nothing.  In fact, the entire time they were making my salad, they were rolling their eyes - no greeting, no eye contact, and they looked pissed AF to be there.  I don't understand how this is acceptable.  I am paying $15 for a fancy salad with extra attitude.  \n\nI showed up after a sixteen hour travel+workday at 9pm, saw that there was a tiny smidge of kale left in their cartons, and asked for my usual custom bowl with kale as a base.  They picked up the tiny amount of kale, put it in my bowl, and I asked if I could have more kale.  I know that they prep gallons upon gallons of kale and easily have more in the back.  My response was: \"we don't overstuff our bowls.\"  Translation: \"I am far too lazy to go get another container of kale.\"  \n\nThe food is as fresh as the other locations (plus one star - sorry - the rest of the experience was awful).  But they need to seriously consider retraining their staff, or finding people who want to work there.  \n\nUnfortunately, because DUMBO is such a food desert, and everything is so overpriced, I imagine this branch will do just fine even with such a subpar customer experience.", "author": "Cathy Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-07", "description": "Food was delicious as per usual but I'm going to have to agree 100% with Darren N - the employees who worked there seemed burdened by having to do their jobs.  Despite my pleasantries, I could barely even get them to make eye contact with me.  I used to live in Washington DC where SG started and back then the employees were happy to be there and eager to please (and interact with) their customers.  I will return to this location because I love the food but my loyal business (and 5 stars) will only be won if and when they fix this major issue.", "author": "KB S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-13", "description": "Great go-to Salad spot.
