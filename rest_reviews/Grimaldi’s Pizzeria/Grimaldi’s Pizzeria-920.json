Just don't even try if you're being spontaneous and pushed for time...seriously, you're going to be standing outside for a long time.  I've always been greeted by a rather friendly Italian-American and promptly shown to our table -- which is often with other people.  I actually like that -- I really do like sitting at a long table with other guests, it feels more social -- like you're at a big family gathering, but I can understand why other people would find that rather uncomfortable.  What I say to that is -- go with it and say \"hi\" to the folk next to you when you're sitting down and hope that they're social (more often than not they are, in my experience).\n\nAs for the pizza itself...it is certainly the best I've ever had.", "author": "Ewen Y."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-18", "description": "I finally decided to come here and see what they hype was all about. Got here early before they opened, maybe 10 minutes prior and no issue with a line. I'm by myself so I end up sitting at the bar.\n\nWhen the bartender comes, I tell him, \"I'm from f-ing New York and I'm not like all these other tourists.\" He laughed when I said that. Nk, besides the table of cops that was behind me, every other table were tourists. Even the other people who joined me at the bar were tourists. \n\nPlace is CASH only, so make sure you bring enough cash. It's a thin crust pizza, not NYC style at all also. So while I liked the pizza, don't think this is an example of NYC pizza because it's absolutely not. \n\nI ordered the 12\" and got a half and half. Got anchovies on one side and pepperoni and olives on the other. Yeah, my pizza turned out kinda salty but it was all good. I ate the whole thing by myself and it's really good. A really solid pizza. There's only one big complaint and I've found. The pizza cools down after 5-10 minutes and the cheese on it congeals. The taste of the pizza becomes very mediocre. at this point. So the lesson is to eat as much as possible when they bring it out to you pipping hot.\n\nSo a funny story. The couple next to me didn't finish their 12\" and left 2 slices. The guy asked if they wanted him to pack it but they told him to throw it out as they couldn't bring it with them. Out of habit, I immediately told them not to throw the food out and I'd take it! Terrible. I suddenly realized what I had done and laughed at myself a little embarrassed but everyone there took in great stride. The couple especially. I told them I was from a third world country and just couldn't see food being thrown out. The couple was again, totally cool and very happy to give me their last two slices. Those slices btw, didn't taste no where as good when I took them back and reheated them. So another lesson, don't do take-out here. Eat the pizza here.\n\nOh, I do want to say one last thing. As much as I liked the pizza, there's no way I would wait 2 hours in line for the pizza. I don't think I'd wait 1 hour for the pizza. Maybe 15 minutes.", "author": "Dang N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-11", "description": "The cheese on the pizza is incredible.

Grimaldi's uses 100 lbs of coal per day!!!\n\nThis is how they get the thin crust crispy with a unique smokey flavour. Less is more here as there is just the right amount of ground tomatoes, mozzarella and basil in their FAMOUS Margherita Pizza. \n\nP.S. We didn't have a lot of time in NYC but wanted to hit Grimaldi's and L\u0026B's for pizza. We booked the \"Slice of Brooklyn\" bus tour and didn't have to stand in line.

So, my brother and I set out on a little adventure to Brooklyn. We arrived a little before six and we were able to be seated right away. Lucky us! We really wanted a beer with our pizza, but they hadn't yet got their license back. No biggie. We ordered a small with mushrooms and sausage. It took a little while for the pizza to come, but we stayed occupied watching the waitstaff hustle and I was completely entertained by their accents. I wanted to strike up conversation just to hear them speak. Our pizza finally arrived and it looked delicious. Nice thin crust that you can easily fold and devour. The ingredients all tasted extremely fresh and you don't get that super acidic overpowering taste you get from canned tomato sauce. We polished the entire pizza off within minutes. I was expecting a little more flavor from the sausage, though. Our experience at Grimaldi's was great, however, I can't say it's the best pizza I have ever had.

If you're the type that likes a light pizza like me, you will love this place. The crust is thin and every topping they throw on is just the right amount in my opinion. Also, I can't get over how beautiful the cheese was. The best. If you're the type that likes the deep dish, heavy on the cheese, you might not like this place as much. Inexpensive, delicious, It is definitely worth the hype all around and I would love to come back but only if the line is short...which is probably never.", "author": "Ai-Mei Z."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-04", "description": "Don't know how good the pizza here truly is because the service was so bad that we didn't get our order until it was almost cold. \nWe placed a pizza order to go \u0026 planned to walk down to the Brooklyn Bridge park,  but they apparently forgot about us \u0026 by the time we went to check on our pizza it was barely \"still hot\" (as the lady put it).

Now hear me out before y'all from Brooklyn try to murder me out here. It was no doubt one of the most unique pizzas I have ever placed in my mouth and it should be famous for that alone. \nThe cheese was a very interesting texture that I couldn't quite put a finger on. Slightly gooey feeling but at the same time stiff in some ways. The cheese was not evenly spread across the pie and there were just parts with just tomato sauce. \nThe toppings were fresh and very nice but this uniqueness didn't sit well with me. It just didn't taste like pizza to me, and left me a bit unsatisfied. I do however compliment them on their legitimate dough crusts that were thin and crunchy. \nI like how the store has an old school feel and that its on the way to the ocean where Manhattan/the bridges can be observed.

No lines for us!  The pizza was probably the best I've ever had, crust, cheese sauce and basil all fresh and delicious.  Cooked on a 900\u00b0 coal fired oven.  The pie cooks in three minutes.

I dined here the week before Christmas of 2012 and there was absolutely no line or wait to be seated. It's a bit cramped though - the chairs are small and so are the tables.\n\nSide note: I found out about this place from a colleague. Funny thing is that I work for a Canadian airline (I'm American and live in Chicago) and one of the pilots, who is Canadian and resides in Toronto, told me about this place. He's never been before, but I will talk him into it when I get a chance.\n\nSo anyway, the pizza was great and the price was reasonable. Best thing was there was absolutely no line! The place was hoppin' though. I love thin crust even though I grew up in Chicago, which is known for deep dish pizza.\n\nThe service could have been better. It was probably lousy because they know their pizza is amazing and you're there to have their pizza, good service or not, which is very unfortunate for us.\n\nTip: Since the service isn't all that great, I would order the pizza to go. That way, you avoid the long line if there is one.", "author": "Pearl H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-23", "description": "Grimaldi's... one of the few on my short list of places to go for pizza.  However, before you read too much into it, it is not the best pizza.  That acclaim can only be given to Di Fara.  People rave and rave about it as the best... i can not disagree more.  My reasoning isnt superficial... nor does it all come down to the pizza itself.  It's everything.\n\nWhen I brought my play date here for some good eats, we noticed the seating was tight and packed together in arms with our neighbors.  So much for atmosphere.  That went out the door, especially with the crazy line waits... is it really worth the wait?  The answer is a resounding no.  Our pizza came out somewhat doughy and crispy at the same time... an odd combination of undercooked-ness.  We also felt like we were being rushed- in and out.  Is the food good, that much I might agree to if I was hungry, which I was.  We'll see if I return...

I didn't really know what to expect with \"authentic new york\" style pizza...I've had versions of it in Seattle, but I was excited to finally try the real thing!  We ended up ordering a sausage \u0026 pepperoni and tasted pretty good!  You can tell they used fresh ingredients and the brick oven makes it taste cleaner! lol\n\nI won't front...after waiting that long and hearing all the hype about this place I expected the pizza to blow me away...but it was just OK to me...comparable to places in seattle like tutta bella and piecoras....\n\nAll in all, it was an experience to wait that long but it's cool to be able to say I've ate at a famous place like this.

You have definitely sent an angel to touch upon the borough of Brooklyn.  Blessed art thou pieces of mozarella cheese, and large leaves of basil.  Blessed is your thin dough, crisp crust.

I was lucky to be there around 5pm and there was no line.  I did take out and took my pizza to the riverside.  I enjoyed my pizza and the spectacular view of Manhattan.\n\nThere is something that detracts from the experience is that there is a buddy-buddy relationship between the regulars and the owners.

I don't know, after waiting about 2 hours for this pizza I really don't think it's really worth all that waiting. We ordered a pizza with just sausage on top of their traditional pizza-they have a white pizza option as well but we went with the more traditional kind. \n\nThe mozzarella was fresh, and you could taste the difference and the basil also was fresh and pungent but there wasn't a lot of it and it was focused on the center of the pizza. The sausage was just all right, I thought it would be a spicy Italian sausage but it didn't really carry too much flavor on its own. \n\nThe pizza though was pretty good, but the overall experience was just okay.", "author": "Ted C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-24", "description": "I'm craving this pizza big time and it's been months since I've consumed it!
