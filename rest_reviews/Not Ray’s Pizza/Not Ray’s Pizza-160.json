I find their crust to cheese to sauce ratio to be spot on and I am hard-pressed to identify one topping I wasn't happy with.  Usually, the boyf and I get a whole pie -  I recommend eating it with someone you love in front of an old episode of 90210.\n\nA really off-beat but yumming topping combo is the broccoli and meatball pie/slice - absolutely delicious.", "author": "Ryan Q."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-26", "description": "Pretty mediocre pizza. There's really no excuse for serving up bland pizza in NYC, especially when there's so many good pizza places to choose from. It tastes a lot like pizza I used to get from a pizza shop back in Florida. Not a good thing.", "author": "Iris D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-22", "description": "Every neighborhood should, and pretty much does, have a place of this caliber. The guys behind the counter are friendly enough and very efficient. Slices are reasonably priced. The pizza here isn't destined to be photographed or to inspire debates between connoisseurs on pizza blogs. They're just simple, solid slices with good enough ingredients, in a charmingly charm-less setting with a couple of counters and corny framed pictures. Seems unremarkable enough, but this is the kind of place people miss when they're not in New York.", "author": "Allison N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-21", "description": "pizza in ft greene pretty much sucks, but this may be the best slice there is.", "author": "Peter K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-18", "description": "It's probably the second best pizza in Fort Greene after Graziella's.  Not Rays has a more traditional pizza style though and you get more pizza for your money, so we still order there regularly.  Almost every other pizzeria in the area has tasted more like a chain to me.\n\nDelivery times are good.  Pizza quality varies depending on who is cooking and time of day like any other pizzeria.  I'd say 75% of the time the pizza is really good and the rest of the time the crust is either really dry or doughie.  To better your odds, don't order late night.", "author": "Franco G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-06", "description": "We picked up 3 large pies (the perfect amount for 7 hungry adults) inbetween a break at rehearsal this evening.  I learned some new things about Not Ray's..  A) They don't take credit cards  B) The larges are HUGE  C) Pepperoni slices are reeeally greasy, but reeeally yummy.", "author": "Amanda H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-13", "description": "Great inexpensive pizza.  Love the thin slices, cheese, and sauce yum.  I did have to pat my slice down b/c of the grease factor!

But each time I wander Soho for the answer, I come back to my own back yard (or near it, anyway)  Perhaps it's the aroma of the yeasty crust wafting down the subway stairs more than anything, but Not Ray's Nick's always satisfies my craving for NY style, fold the piece, one is a meal pizza.
