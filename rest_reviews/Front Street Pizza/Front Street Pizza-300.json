However, it's pretty much everything else about this place that gives it 4 stars. I work across the street, so I come here pretty much every morning for coffee and breakfast. The guys who work here are phenomenal! They recognize everyone, pretty much know your order right away, and they are just the kind of people who want to be friends with - very old school type of small business charm. I really like the coffee (not too strong), and the prices are really decent (95 cents for a small coffee, $1.40 for toast with peanut putter, etc.). They make delicious egg white sandwiches, have fresh hard boiled eggs, etc. Anyway, the list goes on. It's not a fancy place, the pizza is just ok, but the guys are great, the breakfast is cheap and yummy, and the coffee is good. You'll see a lot of cops in there ordering stuff in the morning - always a good sign :).", "author": "S H."}], "servesCuisine": "Pizza", "priceRange": "Under $10", "name": "Front Street Pizza", "address": {"addressLocality": "Brooklyn", "addressRegion": "NY", "streetAddress": "80 Front St", "postalCode": "11201", "addressCountry": "US"}, "@context": "http://schema.org/", "image": "https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LVHDWuYoUFq5OpVt9Xj6JQ/ls.jpg", "@type": "Restaurant", "telephone": "+17188753700"}
