Awesome drinks and exquisite appetizers! My only complaint is the neurotic host who is obviously inexperienced or needs to polish up her people skills. She went into panic mode when we wanted to sit in the outside area but the table was reserved for 7:15pm... It was 5:15 when we were hanging. Calm the eff down honey! There's plenty of time for your bougie hipster clientele!

Let's start from the beginning the bouncers or \" gentlemen\" checking the ids were so rude , and rough looking , I wanted to leave from the time I saw their non welcoming faces. I only stayed because a friend of mine was having a birthday gathering there. After asking for your ID, the bouncer quickly rushes you to pay a bogus coverage fee to get inside. At one point he even tapped my shoulder to inform me to hurry up which was so rude , let someone do that go him, I'm sure he wouldn't like it . I ordered sushi which was TRASH!, over cooked rice with barely there shrimp or crab inside , I'm sure my 10 year old daughter could make one better . Water downed over priced drinks , which I'm sure they thought they did s good job because of the stupid looking flower on the side of the cup. Staff is just rude, while passing you in the crowd they just push their way thru, no excuse me nothing ,. I seen one of the staff members twerking and exposed her bottom and her and the hostess thought it was cute , laughing , ummm ok ,. A beautiful rooftop , that will soon be closed or shut down because of all this . Crowd, not my type of crowd , rugged , rough , I'm pretty sure fights have broke out in here before . At one point I heard a man say \" I'll slap the sh!t out of him \", . Kimoto management you guys turned a beautiful rooftop into a possible death trap and just an overall flop.

The speakers and lights definitely changed the scene from classy lounge to a party house! Now I hear they're hosting events every Saturday. Definitely check out eventbrite for early bird tickets. They hire live hip hop DJs who know their throwback songs. \n\nIf you're here for food, definitely try their Kobe kimchi burger and if you're someone who likes spicy food-- get their spicy French fries. It's the perfect amount of kick and crisp. There's a large assortment of beers and liquor.

Here's the skinny:\n\n- Beautifully decorated. It will remind you of a traditional Ryokan in Kyoto. \n\n- The place is huge. You have the option to sit inside or outside with the amount of space here. \n\n- Great selection of whiskeys, bourbon and craft beer. Reasonably priced. If you're looking for a Corona or Heineken, you're in the wrong place. \n\n- Friendly staff whom are very kind, accommodating and courteous. \n\n- Food is delicious and the chicken wings are a must. \n\nIn an area which desperately needed a new bar scene, Kimoto adds a new type of flare; not only by beer garden standards, but rooftops as well.", "author": "Brian L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-27", "description": "The service here was friendly and very attentive.

There was no line to get in but we had to wait for the elevator. The attendant told us that there was a strict dress code at 7pm. We sat in the covered outdoor area. The temperature was great. The view on East Brooklyn was vast but nothing like looking at the Manhattan skyline. The place wasn't too busy we are able to cobble two tables for the six of us. The waiter didn't write anything down and mess up most of our order. We ordered a pitcher of Sapporo for two of us and they brought out to pints. The girls order Wolffer Ciderbut they were out of that. We ordered chicken Gyoza and vegetable dumplings were given. They fix it and gave us the veggie ones for free. The tuna tartare was okay. The fish were cut into large pieces and it was served with blue, red, and white tortilla chips. Six drinks and 2 apps: $100 Total. \n\n$25 card minimum. \n\nUnless you are staying at the hotel, you can find a better rooftop.", "author": "Leonard L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-21", "description": "I was at this beautiful restaurant music was great food was delicious!

Chicken was yummy. Waffle was interesting. The syrup made all the difference. \n\nOnly thing is the portions are really small. I Still felt hungry after finishing my meal and so did all my friends. I'd recommend ordering fries or some other side to help fill you up. \nService: \nI dont know if it was just that day they were short-staffed but the service was extremely slow. Our food came out first and our sides came out 30-40 minutes after we finish all our plates. They may have forgotten it but even after reminding them, they left out my friend's edamame. Water didn't come till after we finished EVERYTHING and asked for the check.
