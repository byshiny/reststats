The fish is consistently very good, and their appetizers are interesting and delicious.  \n\nI especially LOVE the unagi don (eel).  It is super sweet and succulent, with just the right amount of lovely fattiness.  The dish comes with the most wonderful Japanese pickles, and the rice is decent.\n\nOne thing I REALLY don't like about Kyoto is the miso soup.  It has no flavor. Why?  I don't know.  And it is consistently like this so they must be making it this way on purpose.  Oh well, I can't have everything.  I also wish that there sake list were a bit better, but when I want sake I just head down to Dassara or the East Village.\n\nThe service is very warm and friendly.", "author": "Russ K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-16", "description": "Absolutely delicious.

The prices here are good, but not so low that they cause you to worry about the quality of the fish. I was either seduced by the prices or I have intermittent bouts of amnesia because I ordered from here again about a year or so after a particularly unsatisfactory experience. A friend and I had dined at Kyoto on a holiday weekend, and we were the only people in the restaurant (I also remember the restaurant being completely empty when I used to live closer and get take out from there, back when their sushi was a step above mediocre). It was uncomfortably warm in there, and there were flies buzzing around. My friend and I had ordered different rolls, but both with tuna. When our food arrived, we both thought the tuna tasted very fishy, and it even looked a little discolored. When we told our waiter, he insisted that the sushi was fresh and that it was a different kind of tuna that we might not have been used to. He wasn't rude about it, but he was insistent. Whether or not it was a special kind of sushi that was just designed to taste rotten, we weren't interested. But it took a few more back and forths before he took our plates away and offered to replace the rolls. We were nauseous at this point, so we just asked for the check. I have never had to send sushi back before, not even supermarket sushi.\n\nRecently, I ordered from here again on seamless, not realizing it was the same place until the food arrived. The sushi wasn't expired this time, but it was sub par at best. Thankfully, I hadn't ordered anything with tuna.", "author": "Sandra G."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-27", "description": "Dropped in there and had the shrimp tempura roll. It was very good and came out quick. The service was pretty good as well. This used to be my favorite lunch spot but the music during the day was terrible and often loud.

I like the imagination of them. Here's what we ordered:\nPhoenix - spicy lobster salad, seaweed salad, tempura flakes, crab meat avocado wrapped with soy bean seaweed\nLadybug - two types of tobiko! \nAmerican Dream- yellowtail, tuna, kani, avocado cucumber inside \u0026 seaweed powder caviar outside\nParadise - eel, avocado, crabmeat inside topped with tuna salmon steamed powder\nand one more that I forget in name but in flavor was DELISH. \n\nThis place is no nonsense - not as fancy as Ki Sushi across the street but in terms of taste, a serious contender. Good service and totally reasonable prices.

Relaxed atmosphere and yummy food! To start I had miso soup which was definitely more flavorful and tasted more homemade then miso soup you get most places. My friend and I shared the shrimp shumai which was super delicious and fresh. Then for rolls i had salmon and avocado roll, shrimp tempura roll and a spicy crab crunch roll. I ordered too much!
