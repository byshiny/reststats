I enjoyed that the staff in every stall was very friendly. Although it gets packed and there are barely places to sit, you can get a great meal for a good price. I recommend the LaZhao Noodles at the Hana Bar along with the churros because that was worth the buy! Definitely returning! They also accept card in case cash isn't your fort\u00e9. :)", "author": "Lissa C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-22", "description": "Probably the best food market I've been to- it's large\u0026 spacious with mind boggling options. The first few times I went, it would take a good 10 mins to decide what I wanted. Personal faves are: \nForagers (great breakfast sandwiches)\nArepa lady \nDekalb taco (the BEST chicken quesadilla although small portions) \nEight turn Crepe\nForcellas (pizza place but has BEST Arancini rice balls)\nHome frites \nJianbing company", "author": "S S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-02", "description": "This is by far the best food hall in NYC.  They have numerous choices including Katz's and Ample Hills(two reasons to go anywhere).

With it being a food hall there is definitely portion control and a bit pricey. But I would say great to eat and shop. Can't wait for more stores to rent out levels 1-3. \n\nI tried the classic Hawaiian poke shop and it was super yummy. (After I finished the bowl and I wanted a second one.) I also tried the beef noodle soup from the hand pulled noodle shop (behind the elevator) and it was pretty good except the soup was really salty. Lastly I tried the peppermint patty ample hill ice cream shop and it was bomb! I would go for the medium bowl next time as the large looked reasonable but I couldn't finish it. \n\n(Note: I like this mall better than Atlantic Avenue mall. Definitely different neighborhood just 1 train stop away from each other)", "author": "Brenda M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "Great set up however the space is a bit small for all of these vendors and can turn into a pretty tight cluster.

Located in the industrial chic lower level of the City Point building with a Trader Joe's, Target, Movie Theater, and a few other little shops, it's a fun hub to visit and get some quality food. So many to choose from it can be overwhelming. From pizza and calzones to Chinese. They have fresh cheeses and a butcher. They have bagels and a pastry station, they have a station where you go down the line and choose one item of each list creating an entire home cooked type of meal. It is very clean. They have quite a bit of seating but depending on when you go it can be very hard to get one. This is located right by the Dekalb subway station making it a great place if you are on the go and want to grab a bite.", "author": "Chelsea D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-26", "description": "This place is one of our favorite places to eat in Brooklyn.

And a Target right upstairs?! This place is what dreams are made of!! . So far I'm stuck on Two Tablespoons.  They're a vegetarian/began eatery...their food is just soooo damn delicious!

I decided to eat at Fletcher Brooklyn BBQ and it was a great choice. I ordered the chicken sandwich, the chicken was so flavorful and so was the BBQ sauce. The waffle fries looked amazing, I might get them next time along with ribs. There are about 40 vendors so you have numerous options. The only downside is that the sitting is limited.", "author": "Safe H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-06", "description": "We came to the new Target Store to buy stuff for a new apartment. We were in a hurry but managed to check out the new mall that also includes Flying Tiger and Trader Joe's among other stores. We were very impressed by what we saw. The Foodcourt looks especially inviting, with many food stalls offering a wide variety of choices from beer to Chinese noodles to poke to other cuisines. We tried out the Wiki Wiki poke bowl this time but will definitely be back to check out others. Just the fact that this amazing mall is conveniently located here now is heartwarming and certainly a wonderful enhancement for the neighborhood.", "author": "Geri C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-15", "description": "Underground lair of food stall deliciousness. Fun vibe. Great for eating with a group who likes to explore. Shanghai pancakes, Hawaiian, French pastries, vegan delicious bowls. So much more. Beer and wine. Great prices for NY.
