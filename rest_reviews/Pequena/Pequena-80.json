They made very clear they don't want children there, which is weird because Fort Greene is a very family friendly neighborhood. By-the-way we did not go there at peak time it was Tuesday probably around 5pm. The restaurant was empty when we got there, the two waitresses were pretty much just looking at each other. One of them was more welcoming the other had a frown the whole time we were there except when she brought the check and expected a good tip. I so hope they don't share tips.

My husband,  10 yr daughter and I dined here last night (3/18/26). When we arrived there were many open tables, but the waitress pushed 2 of 3 2-rops together right outside the bathroom. We dint realize it was the bathroom at the time or we would have refused to sit there. At the least she could have pushed the remaining 2-top into the corner. No one brought us chips and salsa although every other table was eating them. We wanted to order dessert, but the had \"run out of flan\" and only had key lime pie.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't give you chips and salsa and runs put of flan at 5pm on a Friday night. We'll know better next time because the food was perfection.

Though I'm sure the great company I dined with was a part of it, the staff definitely helped make the night.\n\nAnd just as impressive was their success in making veggie enchiladas worth eating.  The texture and flavor were both done well.\n\nI only wish that you could mix and match different kinds of tacos (though I didn't ask, maybe they'd be up for it, but it's not on the menu at any rate).  \n\nI'll be back!", "author": "Carl B."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-05-03", "description": "Great Food, I mean I really like it here.  However, I don't tolerate disrespect.\n\nI like Tex-Mex, and the atmosphere is nice. I like the decor.\n\nI was there last night with my girls, and there was a woman and her guy there.  The waitress accidentally spills a drink on the guy, and he gets up and yells \"f***\". I mean I get it.  He never yelled it at her, but i would be upset too if I had 16 oz of water on my lap.  The waitress never apologizes.\n\nLater the girl with the guy walks up and states that she felt that the waitress should have apologized and that the situation wasn't handled properly.  I mean the waitress, who I later find out is the owner, didn't handle it well in my opinion.  She seemed more irritated than the guy.  All I hear next is the waitress say she is the owner, has never seen the couple there before, and pretty much kicked the couple out.  WTF!!!  Who on earth kicks a customer that they spilled water on out! \n\nI am starting to think that restaurants are forgetting to add quality customer service to their menu.

This spring they installed bamboo fencing to block the outdoor seating from the street, and the manager politely asked me to keep the dog outside of the outdoor seating.\n\nI have been a regular for 3 years, and have been bringing my dog since I rescued him last summer. Pequena is a favorite spot for lunch, and we bring friends for dinner weekly. Unless they change the configuration of their fences, I can no longer tie my dog outside (without seeing us he yelps). I fret that the new fencing will deprive Pequena of my patronage and me of their excellent mushroom torta (offered only at lunch). Today I felt unwelcome, and got my food to go. it took 35 minutes to get wrapped for me.\n\nFortunately for me, there are a number of other restaurants in the neighborhood with open barrier outdoor seating, where my dog will be welcomed to be tied outside, or even sit with me. True, NYC health code penalizes 8 points on their evaluation and can cite restaurants for having dogs. However, only 3 restaurants were cited for dogs in exterior locations in 2012, vs. 24 for having dogs inside. In a dog friendly neighborhood like Prospect Heights, many venues are appreciative of dog owners and quietly allow well behaved canine customers.\n\n5 stars for food, 1 star for my sad service experience today.

We loved the guacamole and chips, and the sprinkle of chile powder and pepper on the chips really enhanced the flavor. \n\nI wasn't very hungry, and they offer all of their entrees in appetizer sizes, which I enjoyed. The vegetable tostada had lots of roasted veg and just the right touch of queso fresco. \n\nThe restaurant is very small and cramped, but the atmosphere is fun.

Not being from the USA, I especially appreciate the general culture and attitude of Northern American hospitality towards the customer. Not so in this place!\n\nWe arrived to this place on a weekday in January around 8pm surely bringing a lot of hunger. When we entered the place, it was rather full, so we agreed to take a stroll for 15 minutes to get a seat closer to the entrance; the reason being that my partner has a skin condition which gets really bad with the heating being directly in her face (as was the case in pretty much all areas of the establishment). The stuck-up waitresses not only wouldn't allow us to sit in the empty outside area, they started making fun of my partner behind their backs. In fact even some customers enjoying their meal at that time thought that this behavior was completely uncouth.\n\nAfter returning to the establishment exactly a quarter an hour later - even more hungry - to be seated at the place we'd agreed on, they had allowed themselves to seat another couple at this place telling us that they didn't assume we'd be back and that they have to keep the place busy. After we explained the situation, the couple was even willing to relocate (not having an issue with the heating system, which per se they wouldn't turn off, even though other customers clearly seemed to be more than warm enough), however the staff started to ignore us. We were basically \"forced\" to leave since the bad attitude, the inflexibility and the unwillingness to make us feel comfortable as paying customers and serve us food at this place were predominant. We were left baffled, hungry and to a certain degree irritated.\n\nFortunately enough I write reviews for respected travel magazines, so I can make sure that as few people as possible reading or hearing from me will ever commit the mistake of entering this place with its impudent staff, where obviously the management does not care about the wellbeing of potential customers.
