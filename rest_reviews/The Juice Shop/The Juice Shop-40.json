It really is that hit or miss.\nThe salads and the shakes are mostly always a good choice they are solid.\u00a0 Staff goes a little bit too slow, they can pick up the pace a little bit, but they really are very polite smiling and courteous.\nOne more small downside the price - this place is steep man like for the prices they are charging everything should be a home run each and every time not only sometimes. I'm hoping they can get better with quicker service and fresh hot if it is supposed to be hot food choices.\u00a0 I do really like the proximity of this place, and hope I can continue going there.\u00a0 I just don't think I can if they don't step it up somewhat.", "author": "Dennis T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-08", "description": "Just walked out of this place. It is 8:35, and they supposedly close at 9:00.  When I walked in, they told me that they were done making smoothies and juices for the day, and they only had a bottled juices in the fridge.

I normally eat local, organic, plant-based, vegetarian/vegan meals and The Juice Shop seemed like a decent option.  The food looks good, the staff is friendly. I ordered a Harvest Kale salad.  With tax, it was $10.29. I didn't realize that meant it was a side order. Maybe I am naive, but I shouldn't still be hungry.  Maybe they should charge a dollar or two extra and double the order. No one in Downtown Brooklyn serves such small salads for the price.

I didnt really want any of the other choices that there is around here (shake shack, blue hill country, burger king, panera bread) I wanted something light, healthy, fulfilling and delicious. \nThey have prepacked juices and salads or you can have them make it for you. I think thats cool for the ones that are in a rush. \nThe service was quick and friendly, the girls who work there are very nice. They have a starbucks kind of system where they call your name out once your stuff is ready.\nOn to what I got: I got the green kale pre-packed salad which was very good and fresh! It was composed of chopped kale, chick peas, black olives, diced cucumbers, tomatoes, and diced beets. There was also a side of feta cheese and dressing that I dont remember the name of but it was a type of vinagrette. I wish i had take a pic of the ingredients . For my drink, I got the dr.feel good and it was soo deliciousssss. The only comment I have on it was that it just needed to be blended just a bit longer since I still had peices of fruit in it. If you like your juice a bit more on the tangy side, try Dr. feel good. \nFor the salad and the juice, it was just under $20, I know it caught me a bit off gaurd too..they are deff on the more expensive side but for every now and then or if you happen to find yourself around there, give them a try. I was fulll and content but still felt light at the same time.", "author": "Stephanie C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-12", "description": "This is the most convenient vegan-friendly option if you're attending a convention at the hotel next door.

I love the Juice Shop in SF and this one had so many more options and granola and acai bowls.  They also have salads but I didn't get a chance to try those.  We stocked up on many juices and I had the berry acai bowl for breakfast.  I loved the straight ginger shots.  They definitely helped me get through the conference.

The smoothies are okay, can't blame the location for recipes. However, when its busy you can tell that there is no workflow to determine when to work smoothies, salads, and other items. This location had great potential but the staff seem disinterested and the food served doesn't seem fresh.

Very fresh and colorful and they have just about anything you could be looking for. Service is efficient but lackluster in attitude. It's almost like we feel like we should expect crappy service from a place like this but I don't think we should. It gives the competition a differentiator to win in the market!

Instead of eating though, I decided to get a smoothie since I wasn't that hungry. Although the salads that I saw them make looked really appetizing. The smoothie I had was Mr.Almond.

It's a juice shop with various options of juices.   I decided to get custom made smoothie and that was the biggest mistake I made.  I think my juice was supposed to be a smoothie that was chocolate based but it was just a bland mix of coconut milk, cacao powder and I think coffee.   I wish the person making the drink would have provided recommendations.  On another note, I saw that they also make kale bowls and the toppings offered looked fresh and smelled wonderful.  If I'm ever in Downtown Bk, I may give them a second try by simply selecting a juice off the menu and/or a kale bowl that's off the menu as well.", "author": "Laur D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "Terrible. First of all, when you walk in, the music is way too loud and inappropriate. You can barely communicate with the staff to get your order right! Next, the a\u00e7a\u00ed bowls are horrendous. A\u00e7a\u00ed base has no a\u00e7a\u00ed flavor. It tasted like mashed fruits and water. Finally, in my opinion, the juice was absolutely terrible and overpriced. I paid more than $50 at this place, and I regret it! Go to playa bowls in Newark, DE. Never go here.

Just be careful with the orange juice, it is not freshly squeezed. \nIt turned my stomach into an fire ball.\n\nFresh squeezed orange juice is expected when one is paying close to $10.00 for a 16 oz. smoothie.\n\nAnother down side:  One size only available for smoothies:  16 oz.
