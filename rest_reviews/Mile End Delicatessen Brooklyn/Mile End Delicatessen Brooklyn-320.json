Not worth it. The waiter I've encountered here was incredibly rude both times. I came to pick up some lunch, not to be served an extra large heaping pile of negativity. Both times I popped in briefly to order, pay and take my food to go since I work nearby. This most recent time said waiter kept his back to me when I returned to get my sandwich. I had not even come all the way inside when he points to the counter away from me and goes \"That's you\", then turned his back to chat idly. I promptly asked [if it appeased his highness] could he please humanely hand me the bag of food for which I sorely overpaid like many of the reviews you'll find echo on here. He had already managed to fit in so much sarcasm from the minute I placed my order, but I brushed it off because my goal was to be as brief as possible once I saw it was the same angry guy from weeks ago. That is until what happened at the end which is disgustingly unacceptable for a business/customer interaction.

Fatty, hand sliced beef nestled between perfectly crusty bread with just the right amount of mustard.  One bite of this sandwich would transport me back to the legendary Schwartz's in Montreal.\n\nThe difference with Schwartz's, however, is that they still take pride in the product that they put out.  Mile End seems to have allowed their early successes to get to their head.\n\nSome friends had just moved into the neighborhood and I decided to take the opportunity to give them an introduction to the Smoked Meat Sandwich today.  There was a street fair going on, so we opted for the take-out counter as the restaurant was packed.  I ordered my usual - a large poutine, a smoked meat sandwich and an orange juice.\n\nThe cashier proceeded to grab a jug of orange juice from the fridge and, noticing that the container was getting low, decided that I was only worthy of half a cup of juice.  I was contemplating whether to bring this up when he shoved my credit card and an iPad at me and grunted \"buddy, you're holding up the line.\" Ok, guess half a glass it is.\n\nWe sat down in the seats adjacent to the window and waited patiently for our food.  When my name was finally called, I asked for a cup of water - having finished my three sips of OJ long ago.  Big mistake.  He glared at me and barked \"are you shitting me? These cups cost money.\" I exchanged looks with someone in line, who immediately decided that this restaurant wasn't worthy of their time or money.\n\nService may only be part of the equation, but bad service can have a disproportionate effect on the entire experience.  Please don't make your customers feel like garbage for asking for a plastic cup and tap water after they've paid $31 on a sandwich and fries.\n\nPerhaps it was my frame of mind, but the smoked meat sandwich was unbearably salty today, and the poutine was oddly bland.  The final nail in the coffin was when we were still fuming several blocks away and we realized that the cashier hadn't offered us forks for our poutine or a paper bag so we weren't juggling food.\n\nMile End now evokes images of salty, overbrined meat, bland, tasteless, hard-to-eat fries and bad service.\n\nNeedless to say, neither my friends nor I will be returning.", "author": "Alex L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-02", "description": "You've probably read it 100x here already: poutine. There aren't many places in the city to have this Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois 'delicacy', which will guarantee you instant addiction - if you're already a fan of fries and gravy.\n\nMile End's poutine is on a slight salty side, but then again, poutine is supposed to be salty. When compared to M. Wells's poutine, I enjoyed Mile End's better because, the cheese curds seemed to have a better bite, and the amount of gravy was just right - not so much that the fries become too soggy. \n\nHowever, it's been a while since I had M. Well's (any) poutine, so...\n\nI am a fan of the kasha varnishkes from Jewish delis, my impression of them is usually dry and simply a bowl of carbs. And I love them! So I was compelled to order though a bit reluctant to - gizzards and gribenes are totally fine, but not sure I'd want to eat veal meatballs. \n\nI was at first shocked when the k.v. came - it looked nothing like the regular deli sort, it was drenched in glistening sauce and the pasta was a soft delicate pappardelle. The taste reminds me of regular k.v. but it's drastically different. It was decadent and meaty (go figure).

I used to live in this 'hood, but it wasn't until I moved back to Manhattan that I heard about it? \n\nMaybe the locals kept their closely guarded secret because this place is such a gem. Montreal-style smoked meat and poutine in NYC? I'm in. Went for lunch on a Sunday, and had about a 45 minute wait, but we had some delicious coffee while we waited (helped us stay warm too!). \n\nOnce you're inside, the place is small, but very nicely decorated - definitely not \"deli\" style, except for the lunch counter seats. The smoked meat was delicious. Not quite as good as what I've had in Montreal, but very, very good. The poutine is the same: not quite the same as Montreal, but very, very good. \n\nIt's a bit pricey, yes, but not ridiculously so.

There are bagels and there are bagels and Montreal bagels are the best you'll ever have so when I found out that this genius former Montrealer was bringing THESE bagels to NYC, Brooklyn no less, I almost lost it. Plus, producing smoked meat that far trumps anything you'll find in Montreal or NYC, again, GENIUS! So glad the guy ditched law school. \n\nMile End reminds me of a much nicer version of Montreal's Beauty's. The ambiance is so welcoming, the counter is comfortable and the vibe is truly wonderful. I love the breakfast sandwich, topped with the thickest, meatiest bacon ever, and of course settled onto a delicious, mildly sweet, effortlessly tender Montreal bagel (make sure to specify that you want the bagel, not the rye toast). Poutine is literally to die for and the smoked meat, well, as I said earlier, this is the best smoked meat I've ever had. \n\nMile End is a jewel in Brooklyn's crown.

If you go early, it feels more like a neighborhood diner (which it is really) and less like the hyped-up destination du jour.\n\nThe second trick is to treat your brunch like it's a 3-course dinner. I usually start with the Montreal bagel with onions and tomato, move on to the mishmash with salami, and finish with one of their sweet pastries.

Brooklyn is the trendiest of trendy these days, and not only is ME billed as a Montreal deli, but I noticed a place nearby offering Montreal bagels -- is there an influx of hip Quebecois?\n\nAnyway, the sandwich was outstanding and I was grateful that it was not obscenely large as seems to be a requirement at some NY delis.  Pickles excellent too.  Fries very crisp, which I like.

We decided to share a rueben and the latkes (for Hannukah) and honestly I've had better tasting deli in bodegas.  the quality of the food is fine, but the flavor is not just mild, it is missing other than the clove flavor which I personally found distracting. If there was cheese on the rueben neither of us tasted any and the russian dressing has no sweetness to it at all. The bread wasn't toasted and the sandwich was very small.  The latkes were small but tasty (although my friend didn't find them as tasty as I did).  Service was fine.

However, with the chill of Autumn in the air I decided to treat myself to a sit down lunch in their original Boerum Hill location.\nFiguring I'd skip the famous poutine this time I instead opted for the Reuben (with pastrami of course though there is a smoked turkey option). I also decided to make it a deluxe which adds a pickle, some red cabbage slaw, and some fries. Got a Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray soda to wash it down!\nThe Reuben was flat-out delicious, with homemade Russian dressing was of the 1,000 Island variety and had sizable pickle pieces in it; more diced than almost-minced like usual. It was served on pumpernickel bread which seemed dense enough to address my typical complaint that a warm and moist sandwich always goes right through the bread; this beauty held fast and was mighty satisfying. No it's not as cartoonishly gargantuan as some of the touristy Manhattan \"delis\", but it was plenty big and nicely balanced.\nThe pickle was snappy and the slaw very good. The fries seemed homemade and were probably great when fresh but mine were a might hard in a \"fried a little while ago\" way and not in a \"fried just a few extra seconds for delicious crunch\" way. You know what though? If the rest of the food in front of me wasn't so stellar I wouldn't harsh on those fries. 2.5 star fries in a 4.5 star joint is 100% acceptable in my book (I ate them all so what am I really taking about?). \n\nMile End has what you want on a blustery day people; go get some!", "author": "National H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-09", "description": "So this is serving as an update. Before you read any further, check the calendar and if it is Tuesday night you need to log off your computer and put your name on the seating list for Mile End's Burger Night. I have been meaning to try this for a few weeks now, especially after I noticed it being mentioned in New York Magazines \"Approval Matrix\" (it was both Brilliant and Highbrow!). \n\nFor $19, you get a side of poutine (which has amazing gravy), a choice of a Labatt Blue, Wine, or soda, and, perhaps, the best burger of your life. This was a thick patty which was cooked to perfection, seasoned exceptionally well (I can still taste the kosher salt), and served with no frills, just cheese, pickles, and a few onions. What so many places don't get is that you don't need all the extra junk on top (carmelized onions, avocados, sauteed mushrooms, etc) to make an excellent burger. Sure all those things are good and should serve to enhance the meat but they should not be there to distract from it. Mile End executes this dish to perfection and it serves to highlight the fact that when it comes to meat, these place knows what they're doing. \n\nI can only hope that they sell these burger patties at their new production shop in Red Hook because only being able to have this once a week may kill me....if all the red meat I am about to consume doesn't first.", "author": "Troy K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-11", "description": "It is just ok, more quality, less quantity would be a step in the right direction.
