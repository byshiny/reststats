My son is nuts about the lamb and has fries with them sans truffles, my daughter loves the game menu and has broadened her horizons so to speak, the steak au poivre is to die for. The prices are pretty fair considering how much food you get - and I mean, you get a lot of food on that little table! - and it's for both casual and special occasions. They are also especially kind to my disabled son and if you can't get your waitress for some reason, the manager is extremely hands on and will take care of you.", "author": "Jj D."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-08-31", "description": "In the past 10 years I have been to Henry's end probably approaching 24 times. Even since I moved from NY to NJ , I have still celebrated many special occasions there. I remember the first time I approached the door, I thought, \"Is this a bar?\" I do not return for the ambiance or the service which is always prompt.  It is about the food, which is some of the best anywhere and at a great price.\n\nBe sure to go for their annual wild game festival. Their mustard crusted elk chops are my favorite dish of all time.", "author": "Schiffon W."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-23", "description": "Absolutely delicious!  I loved every single morsel of the meal.  They have some really cool gamey options on the menu that are atypical of NY restaurants.

From first entering the restaurant you are treated like family. There are no signs of white table cloths or pretension. The dark walls and low lighting enhance the feeling of relaxation. Over the windows and above the bar hang multi-colored Christmas lights. A neon sign hangs on the wall towards the back of the dining room...and with the colored Christmas lights gives the place a \"no-nonsense\" and mid-nineties nostalgia (in a good way, I promise).\n\nThe wine list impressed me. You could easily find a great bottle of wine to accompany your meal for about $35 or you could blow your paycheck and get one for $500...they have everything in between. I went for a 2007Joel Gott Zinfandel. It was juicy and spicey and full of jammy, blackberry flavor and paired perfectly with our entrees.\n\nI went with the Wild Mushroom \u0026 Lingonberry Duckling with portobello and morel mushrooms, shallots, thyme, brandy and lingonberries. It was perfectly prepared, seasoned, cooked and presented...some of the best duck I have had. My friends had Chicken Lemonese (breaded with romano, and served on a rich, lemon cream sauce) and Blackened Lamb Sirloin (spiced lamb sirloin, seared and sliced over garlic mashed potatoes with a bar-b-q glaze). Both dishes were excellent. I would be happy with anything on the menu after trying these options. \n\nI'd go back here in a heartbeat...it was wonderful from start to finish. Afterward you should take a stroll down by the river and enjoy one of the best views of Manhattan", "author": "Tony L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-15", "description": "I can never understand why a popular, busy restaurant can't spare a few dollars to RENOVATE!  At least paint!  I found the restaurant crowded and dirty.  \n\nFood was just Ok.  We ordered from a special menu for valentines day.  The oysters were fresh, my husband ordered stuffed quail, he said it was ok.  We both ordered filet mignon for our entree.  It came with some brown sauce over it, but lacked simple seasoning like SALT and pepper. When the restaurant is rated $$$, I shouldn't have to touch my salt shaker, which I did numerous times.  The confused chocolate dessert was ok, but confusing...appropriately named.  I just wished I didn't see the food runner's thumbs on the plate of every dish he served.

We arrived on the early side and it was already bustling with regulars (as other reviewers have noted, it's a romantic place with a neighborhood-y feel). The menu is large but our server helpfully directed us to his personal favorites on the game week menu. \n\nWe tried the shaved Brussels sprout salad which was good though a little underwhelming (the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch).\n\nWe also tried a small plate of gnocchi with boar ragu which was flavorful but a bit tough (I may be forever spoiled by the exceptionally tender and flavorful veal ragu tagliatelle that I ate earlier this summer at Au Pied du Cochon).\n\nFor the main course we shared a venison special with spinach and sweet potatoes and the duckling with mushrooms and lingonberries. We also tried the turtle soup from the game week menu.\n\nThough nothing knocked my socks off, everything was well prepared and flavorful.

Great atmosphere and it was a very clean establishment, especially the bathrooms. The people in my party were not happy with their food, but I certainly was!

I have never been disappointed.\n\nIt is a great place for a date, very romantic, though not a first one.

There is also a great selection of whisky.\n\nTip: They get busy quick, I usually call to reserve a table so I don't have to wait.\n\nThis is a small restaurant and a bit crowded, but the food is well worth it.", "author": "Anna H."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-02", "description": "My first 5 star review.\nWe wanted to try Henry's End for the food but were a little concerned about the hipster rep, small tables and cramped quarters. We come to Brooklyn from Montreal  every month or so to visit our children and grandchildren and Brooklyn Heights is our preferred stomping ground because of it's proximity to our hotel.\nAt any rate this is not Patty Duke's Brooklyn Heights, (you gotta be old to get that reference), its chic, expensive and popular beyond belief, Henry St. a local jewel, choc full of eclectic and exciting culinary choices, all lined up over a block or two.\n\nWe decided on the Italian restaurant next door (which doesn't take reservations) and were surprised that it was overflowing on a Sunday night. Peeking into Henry's End next door we spotted a table and decided to jump at the chance.\nWhat a serendipitous choice!\nThe food was quite simply fabulous. Every one of the four main courses ( sorry read: 'entrees' in America) was daring innovative and quite delicious.\nService was above par and the noise level was such that we had some fine dinner conversation.\nWe were never rushed and enjoyed our best meal in Brooklyn so far. \nWe shall continue sampling other great local restaurants on our return trips, but will surely return here to enjoy some of Brooklyn's finest plates.", "author": "Justan A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-23", "description": "I can't believe this place is rated so highly.\n\nI went to dinner with a friend here. We were seated at the table in the far back, with a window to the back concrete area, complete with a view of the pigeons and rats running around. It smelled a little funny from the beginning, but we decided to stay.\n\nFirst of all, for a place know for wine and beer, their waitress poured our beers with great fanfare, but clearly doesn't know how to properly pour a beer from bottle to glass. The ratio we're going for is not 60% head, people, with it rising over the edges of the glass. I would have preferred to do it myself, thank you.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers for a light meal. After a while, we were brought a basket of somewhat limp-looking bread. When the appetizers finally arrived, both of us took a few bites of our respective dishes, looked at each other, and agreed this would never happen again. The crab cakes were mostly filler (no lumps of crap) and tasted like they had been in a freezer far too long. I couldn't stomach more than a few bites. The only comment my friend made about the bbq shrimp was that it was \"weird,\" and commented that \"now we know not to come back.\"\n\nAll the while, every time the cooks fired up a new dish, the smell grew more intense -\u00a0both smoky and sour and really very off-putting.", "author": "Katie T."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "description": "My lady took me here for a nice night out.

My friend and I sat down, ordered our dessert, and our coffee was on the table immediately with bread. \n\nBread. Before dessert. \n\nHad I died and gone to heaven? \n\nThe butter they serve with the bread here is so fresh and delicious...I seriously didn't realize there was anything wrong with the butter I have at home until I tried this butter. The dessert did not disappoint, either. Whenever Henry's End has a dessert special, I strongly recommend that you order it. I got the mudslide pie and it was decadent but not too rich. \n\nThe waiter and waitress who served us were really kind and unobtrusive. Henry's End has a great vibe...it can be trendy and Brooklyn chic, but ultimately it is incredibly homey.

Our waitress was lovely, but she was overwhelmed.\n\nThe food.... the food was just OK. I had the lemonese veal, I did not realize that the lemon creamy sauce was going to be covering the whole plate. I had to take my veal off the plate so it wont be soaked in it. The sauce was way too tangy for me, so I couldn't eat it. The veal piece on the other hand was delicious. My husband had the sirloin lamb, which was really good.\n\nWe did have appetizers and desserts, nothing to yelp about.. very ordinary.. \n\nPortions are on the small side and you have to pay to get sides like potatoes and greens... honestly I don't know if I would go back, there are many other options in NYC that are excellent and have the same price point. \n\nI am very upset to write this review, but Henrys End just didn't do it for me..", "author": "Sera A."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-08-13", "description": "Came here twice for the Australian game food theme they had going on.
