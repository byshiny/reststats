The food is fine, almost good, but ultimately forgettable.  I had the salad nicoise which was overdressed, but tasty and the BF had the gnocci.  Each ingredient in his pasta was fine, but they didn't really come together.  \n\nIf this were the only place on the block I'm sure I'd come back but with Smith street hopping with great places to eat Verde seems unnecessary.", "author": "Becca F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-08", "description": "I can't believe how many times I've walked past this place and never gone in!  Luckily, I came to my senses recently and had dinner.  The only draw back is that the food was so good, it gave me violent thoughts.....that's not weird, right? \n\nAnyhoo - I really like the look and feel of Verde.  There was a cool blue grass (or something?) trio playing at the front of the restaurant.  They sounded amazing.  We started off outside in the garden, which we had to ourselves.  Cut to twenty minutes later when we got attacked by mosquitoes so we headed back inside (c'mon, the bottom of my foot, REALLY?!!)\n\nWe shared the Eggplant Lasagnetta - it was so good it made me angry.  Like punching someone in the face angry.  It's ridiculously delicious.  You could have it as your entree because it's rather large - I'll remember that for next time.  \n\nFor my entree I had the Salmon with Spinach and Couscous.  Again - so good I wanted to physically harm my dinner companion.  That's ok right?  My dinner mate had the Straccetti -  mouth watering sliced fillet mignon over a bed of arugula and parmesan cheese.  I found myself reaching over the table quite often to steal some juicy morsels.  And again, wanting to kick someone in the back bc it tasted so damn good.  \n\nFresh, yummy tasting food, good drinks and excellent service - I'm definitely going back, hopefully next time I won't be so angry about it.......", "author": "Monks C."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-21", "description": "We wandered in here on a cold snowy night (first night of Spring!!!!!!). We'd been in for drinks a long time ago, but never a meal.\nIt was not crowded, but we decided to sit at the bar, as they have a sort of endless \"happy hour\" at the bar. We had lovely cocktails, then ordered food and wine. The\nbartender, Tanya, was quite pleasant and very professional. There is a TV at the bar but\nthankfully it was not on. (I don't remember it ever being on in 3x there) They were playing very cool rock (or whatever) music on the sound system. All in all, great ambience.  Elegant and yet quite cozy.\nWe ordered a house salad and the fried gnocchi/sausage/brocc rabe to split, and it was\nmore than enough to satisfy!! And it was DELICIOUS!!!.\nAll in all, maybe the best dining experience we've had on Smith Street, which is chockablock with over-hyped, overpriced, and/or underwhelming restaurants.\nCan't wait for the outside dining area to open!!  Though sitting at the bar, which we don't usually do, was remarkably enjoyable.\nHighly recommended!!", "author": "Paul S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-18", "description": "Very sedate and pleasant atmosphere.

The planning experience was awesome. menu was set, prices great and responses were fast. I had about 21 people and we were set up in the backyard.  It was windy/cold but its not all their fault for that , note: Verde does not have out door heaters. \n\nThe drinks were flowing for the first hour, appetizers were scrumptious (get the beets even if you don't like them you will become a fan). The pasta dishes were on the salty side, i believe they over salted because they were making big batches instead of individual dishes. \n\nWhen the second hour approached the restaurant got busy and our food took a little longer to come. The waiters went back in to serve the dinner rush and we were left on our own in the cold. The main dishes were cold but tasty, think about if it was cold and stuff tasty it must be scrumptious if they were piping hot. \n\nSo over all... I probably would not have another party out doors since there are not heating units in case of the cold. I wished the pasta was not over seasoned but other than that, Get the BEETS, the fillet was delicious and the tuna is excellent on its own, wasn't a huge fan of the mashed beans.\n\nIf you can eat with a couple of friends in the dining area the service is great and you will be warm.", "author": "Tassamai S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-10", "description": "Fantastic food and lovely, attentive service.  We came here via Savored and its been our best experience (of a number of good experiences) using that site/service.\n\nWe had the eggplant \"lasagna\" appetizer, the tuna with cannelini beans and escarole and the gnocchi with broccoli rabe and sausage and each dish was excellent.  The tuna dish in particular was wonderful.  Our only criticism was with the montepulciano by the glass, which was okay (and generously poured). . . just not up to the exceptional level of the rest of the meal.\n\nThe space is really nice, the music even better, the wait staff was impeccable in their responsiveness, and the prices were great for the quality and presentation of the food.  \n\nIt's a hike for us but we'll be back again very soon and we'll bring pals next time.

I went for a late birthday brunch and had bloody mary's that were good, but needed to be more spicy, which made them a lot better -- but that is always my preferred method of making things better. The place is swanky inside, very comfortable, cozy, and pretty small.

Not too fussy, just the right mix of sophisticated and homey.\n\nNow to get to the food: First, my friends and I ended up getting a very very late brunch, thank god they still had it available as it seem every other place in the area seems to have finished their brunch much earlier. I ended up having the tuna salad with arugula and I have to say it was much tastier then I expected.  My friend also had the panini which was pretty size-able and her nice had the spaghetti carbonara. I was pretty worried about her nice since kids are not very willing to try something new, but I was relieved to see she finished her plate up in less then 15-20 minutes. She loved it!.\n\nWe couldn't leave with just brunch (especially since we'd been eyeing the deserts brought to a table nearby) so since we couldn't decide we ended up getting both the nutella and banana crepe and the pineapple ravioli.  The crepe was wonderfull, very thin (just the way I like them) and filled with a mixture of ricotta and nutella, topped with bananas and of course, more chocolate. :-). I have to say I didn't expect the mixture of nutella and ricotta, and didn't know what that would taste like but we ended up loving it. My friend on the other hand  was partial to the pineapple ravioli filled with coconut. Very very light and great for a summer desert. \n\nThe only regret we both had is that we ended up at the subway station before we realized we forgot to ask for a dinner menu. We are definitely heading back for dinner sometime.

Meh. Portions were really small. French toast was pretty good, fritattas were alright . None of us were impressed with the quality.

We went this morning for brunch, and I'd say it's exactly what you'd expect:  food is fine, nothing special but be definitely didn't have the experience of some of the earlier reviewers with long delays and such.  I think they may have worked out the brunch kinks at this point.  If you like Apt. 138, Cafe Luluc, etc, you'll probably find this fits into that general style of restaurant.\n\nThe one thing that really needs to be changed is the music.  It's maybe 11:45 AM, Mother's Day, and I was confused as to how we had ended up in Ibiza.  *Loud* techno pumping from the speakers made me wonder if I could get a side of E with my omelette.  I'm talking serious untzUntzUNTZ techno here.  Guys, it's before noon on Sunday.  Let's put down the glowsticks and simmer down.\n\nOtherwise, totally fine experience.

Overall, a very good experience.\n\n*Tasty bread, olive oil, and olives\n*Tasty \"eggplant parmagiana\" style appetizer\n*Very tasty mussels (typical white wine/garlic broth, but really tasty)\n*Great ribeye steak -- charred outside, flavorful inside\n*Scrumptious gnocchi with broccoli rabe, sausage, and more of that white wine/garlic brothy sauce.  Gnocchi had a great texture, and the broccoli rabe wasn't bitter at all.  I wasn't bothered by the duplication in taste between this pasta sauce and the mussels -- it was so good I was glad to get it twice.\n*Delicious lobster special -- don't know how they managed to get sweet corn in April.\n*Sorbets were a little icy, but tasty; cake was a little crumbly but tasty, and ice cream was creamy and delicious\n*Wines were pricey but tasty\n\nMy only two cavils -- a little pricey, and they mistakenly charged me twice for a replacement drink when mine spilled.  They couldn't have been quicker or nicer about removing the charge, however.\n\nThe owner/manager came by a few times and seemed genuinely happy that we were enthusiastically happy with our food.\n\nThe waiters were good with our 10-year-old kids.\n\nSince this restaurant is just up the block from us, we'll add it to the places to go for special occasions.  Unfortunately, a little rich for us for daily fare...\n\nPS -- they weren't the least bit snotty to us about our Groupon.

I know my review won't make or break anyone's business (hopefully), but it bothers me just the same. Ok enough of my crying.\n\nI shared some baked clams which were good and ordered the shrimp scampi with saffron risotto for myself. The scampi started off perfect I had about 6 or 7 shrimp surrounding my risotto and I was pleased. The problem started about 2 shrimp in.

I always make time for Verde, they always remember me, and they always go out of their way to make me feel welcomed; like family...\n\nIt is a very personal experience, dining at Verde's. All the wait staff, including the owner Cono come over to speak, talk about specials and wines. Everyone is exceptionally well-versed in all the aforementioned. Some people don't like such familiarities, but I do, and this just adds to the entire experience. I allow for 2 hours or more when eating here. I'm never in a hurry, and tears roll out of the corners of my eyes as I finish one dish and prepare to move on to the next.\n\nEverything is made from scratch. The wine list is superb, with many delicious \"sleepers\", which the waiters all know, and pair with food like nobody's business.
