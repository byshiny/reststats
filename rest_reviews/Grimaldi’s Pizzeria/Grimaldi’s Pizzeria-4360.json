Yeah its better than Pizza Hut, but don't get your hopes up to high like I did- after all its just pizza. Another problem was the wait. It took us about an HOUR AND A HALF just to get in.

This place reminds me of Pizzeria Da Baffetto in Rome and that's the highest compliment I can give.  The crust is thin but not too thin and all of the toppings are amazing.  My cousin, my boyfriend, and I trekked here in 0 degree weather and managed to eat two pies.  (they don't do slices)", "author": "Angela K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "Let me just say that this review will break a lot of hearts.\n\nI do have to put it out there that I have been avid fan of Yelp for a while now but never felt the need to create an account / post a review until my recent visit to Grimaldi's where I felt the need to tell people the truth.  I know I have not built up my credibility in the Yelp community yet but this is my review.  Take it or leave it.\n\nSince we were already doing the touristy thing by going to Grimaldi's, we decided to top it off by walking over the Brooklyn Bridge to get there being that it was the one day it was not raining in NYC this summer.\n\nOnce we arrived, there was already a line and a man with a clipboard taking names.  We were told there would be a 40 minute wait.  No biggie, except that it was about 90 degrees that day and most of the line did not have any shade.  But we have no one to blame but ourselves since we made the decision to go there.  The restaurant did have a water cooler for those of us waiting on the line.  Not too bad of a gesture I would say.  True to his word, about 40 minutes later, we were called.  We were lucky enough to be seated at the end of the cafeteria style table so we only had to watch out for 2 elbows.  We ordered a small pie, half plain and half garlic.  At this point, we were famished.  20 minutes later, our waiter gave us the pizza.  FAIL.  It was not worth the wait and any different than any other pizza I have tried.  The first slice was okay because it was steaming hot and that's when a pizza tastes the best.  My 2nd slice was already cold and soggy.  Run to your nearest Patsy's.  Then again, pizza is pizza, you can never go wrong with bread, cheese and tomato sauce unless you're being fed by Domino's. I am quite content with my $1.50 slice from the local corner pizzeria.\n\nIt's safe to say Grimaldi's is never again for me.  I SO badly wanted it to be great because of the hype and because I just wasted about an hour waiting for pizza.  Who is the genius in charge of the PR for this place anyway?  If you do decide to go, go for the experience and not the food.  AND if you want to make it a whole day where you over pay for mediocre food, try the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory down the block where the ice cream sundae is no different than that of McDonald's. \n\nAnd like many Yelpers has already mentioned, there are a ton of tourists that go here.  Tourists never really bothered me because it IS New York City.  What do you expect?", "author": "Yu-Ching L."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-10-17", "description": "I've been a New York most of my life and have been hearing about Grimaldi's for years.  Last night after walking past and seeing there was no line my sister and I decided to give it a try and we definitely will never be back.  The pizza was just okay, but I've definitely had better.  Apparently they shut the oven's down for 30 minutes between 5-7 to \"reboot\" the oven but not sure why they wouldnt do it earlier.  They keep a line outside the restaurant almost to make Grimaldi's seem like a bigger deal then it was because there were plenty of available tables inside.  They only accept cash but both ATM's inside were down.  When I asked the manager for the nearest ATM, he sent me on a wild goose chase and after a solid walk turns out there was a small ATM right next door.  We were told when we went in that the ovens had gone down and it would be 20-30 mins.  About 30 minutes later we were told again that the ovens had just gone down and it would be another 20-30 minutes and that the earlier statement didn't factor in the pizzas they had left to make.  Trying to get change for our check at the end was also quite a process.  Crowds inside are loud and touristy, children screaming, bathrooms dirty.  All in all, definitely go somewhere else -NY is filled with good pizza, much better than Grimaldi's and for a lot less, and all without the hassle.", "author": "Kimberly S."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-14", "description": "Grimaldi's Pizza, what can I say.  This establishment has become an icon of Brooklyn Pizza for a reason.  I have never been disappointed by this place and will continue to go back.  Everything seems just right, from the thickness of the crust, to the firmness of the pie, fantastic.   Never to oily and always has right amount toppings.  I have never actually eaten inside of Grimaldi's since I am not the biggest fan of standing line for an hour.  You can frequently expect a line down the block with a mix of tourists with a few local New Yorkers mixed in-between.

Been going for years. I think the hype has gone to their heads though. The last time I was there, we stopped in for a quick late-night bite and just ordered a small pizza, nothing more. I got the sense from the server that he was disappointed the order wasn't bigger. This sense was reinforced over the course of the dinner, when I repeatedly asked for water, asked three different servers, and never got service. It was late, and it was half-empty even. So no excuses there.

I am not a fan of pizza BUT I am a fan of great food and Grimaldi's just did not make the cut. My major complaint about the pizza was that it was soggy.
