Overpriced, and the smoked meat sandwich is pretty blah to me.

The establishment itself was smaller than we thought it would be and the atmosphere was very romantic yet hipster. Scratch that. It was very hipster with mood lighting. When we entered, we weren't shown to a table, and for a couple of seconds, my friend and I had stood around awkwardly until a nice bearded hipster on his Macbook Air told us that we could sit anywhere that we wanted. I'm not even sure that he worked there.\n\nSitting down at a picnic table was kind of nice. The menu came after I had glanced over the drink menu (I was unimpressed with their alcohol choices), and the menu didn't seem to have much on it. Their \"famous\" poutine was listed all the way at the bottom, which made it hard to find. But anyway, I decided on the duck sandwich and my friend got the poutine with roasted meat.\n\nThe poutine was pretty good, I'd say - but I wouldn't know, because I've never had real poutine. But then again, you can't really go wrong with cheese curds, gravy, and french fries. When my sandwich came out, I was a bit disappointed at how small it was. Since I was really hungry and I wanted to try this delicious food, I just dug right in. The \"duck\" was really salty - it was only after my friend and I had left that we realized they messed up my order and gave me the roasted meat sandwich, which was really salty.\n\nOverall, while the poutine was good and the sandwich was okay (even though that's not what I ordered), my experience wasn't too bad. I probably wouldn't venture out all the way to Brooklyn just to eat at Mile End ... in fact, now that I've tried it, I don't think I'll be going back there.\n\nThe food was way more expensive than it should have been, in my opinion, given the portion sizes. Oh, and I'm pretty sure that our hipster waiter was high - he also smelled like a hobo. But hey, its all about the experiences, right?", "author": "Pam K."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-21", "description": "4 star sandwich but overall 3.5 stars bc of the fries. \n\nSmoked brisket sandwich: delicious and moist.

Their first time here my second. Last time had the lamb merguez sausage which was flavor packed and delicious. This time we split the potato latkes with sour cream and smoked salmon, Reuben sandwich, and half sour pickle. The latke dish was fulfilling and the smoked salmon was a nice touch.  The Reuben with kraut and Russian dressing had a good taste to it though some of the meat was a little too fatty for my mom.  The matza ball soup was good according to steph but the broth was a little too salty. The service was great and we were lucky to get seated quickly.  I think the lines can build up since there are only four tables for four, one table for two and five seats at the counter. All in all it was a nice meal with my girls.", "author": "Mark N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-02", "description": "I love this little place. We've been going here for a while on mornings and weeknights when it's less busy. Food is always delish! The smoked meats, poutine, and bagels from black seed are reminiscent of the streets of mile end in Montreal. They're a small place so if you have a baby, you have to hold them and keep their hands busy with bagels (which they given us freely) and hold them cause they don't have spaces for high chairs but we still made it work.", "author": "Ruth N."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-04", "description": "I snagged a quick Saturday brunch over the weekend since my two girl friends and I were already in the neighborhood.  I'd been eyeing this place for quite some time since its name is splashed all over the foodie blogs that I read.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Smoked Meat Deluxe (smoked meat sammich, pickle, slaw \u0026 frites). If you place this order, I recommend you split it with another because it is a large sammich. Or eat it all yourself, fatty.\n\nI also ordered a side of poutine frites with smoked meat on top.  The fries were surprisingly delish!  Thin cut and crispy.  However, the combination of the cheese and meat overpowered the fries a bit.  The amount of fries was not proportional to the amount of toppings, but this is a personal preference of mine.\n\nSERVICE: really, really friendly waitstaff who are on point with the estimated wait time.  They checked on our meal a couple of times and never rushed us to leave, even though it's a small space, thus requiring a fast turnover.\n\nLAYOUT: open kitchen, which I LOVE because I get to watch the chefs in action. Wood paneling, industrial lighting.\n\nWhat's not to love about this place?

Really?!? A deli? I was picturing a hole in the wall place with a butcher in the back and sausages hanging from the ceiling. Well don't be fooled - it's more of a small chic little restaurant that does cool things with poutin (even after I had a poutin overload in Montreal a month before) and other meat sandwiches. We had duck confit poutin (never found anything like that in Montreal - delicious!) and I had one of the tastiest Reubens I've had in a long time. Silly of us not to notice the big bottles of beer on the wall or the shelves filled with wine bottles - yes the deli does serve alcohol, which should've been painfully obvious to me if I hadn't been so ravenous that I didn't notice the mini alcohol menu in the center of our communal table. Lovely staff.

Sifting through the comments here, it seems there is some contention as to whether it's \"authentic\" Montreal style, but long story short, I was really happy with what I ate. The fries were delicious and crispy, the gravy savory and kind of understated, the cheese curds satisfyingly salty, and the fried egg absolutely perfect. The icing on the cake was the house cured bacon. Mmmm. A special they had going also looked excellent and I nearly chose that over the poutine- it was turkey with eggs and biscuits.\n\nThe coffee was also really wonderful and high quality. I don't know what they brew there, but it was great. Roasted perfectly- you could tell.\n\nOne thing I wished was different was the seating. The place is TINY. We did come at peak brunch hour, and were incredibly lucky to get a table with only a 5 minute wait- we were seated right in the window at this little 2 person table, and it was totally charming and sunny with the window. But I honestly felt pretty squashed in there. It's winter so we all have bulky clothes on, and I could barely cut my bacon because my left elbow kept hitting the brick wall right behind me. So claustrophobic! \n\nBut delicious.", "author": "Emmy M."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-10", "description": "Been here quite a few times and always had the brisket...
