Everything I had met my expectations. I actually work in the area and when I heard that this place opened I had to try it! The owner is a cool guy, makes good conversation and seems to care about his customers. I came to find out he actually has another location in sunset called sunset park diner on 5th Ave and 7th ave donuts and diner in Park Slope. I highly recommend this place!
