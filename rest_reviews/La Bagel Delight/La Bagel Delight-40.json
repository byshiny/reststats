We had to ask for a refund sinve they would not remake the order. I asked to speak to manager and was told that no manager would be available until the following Monday. Apparently this store is only managed one day a week and customer service is a not a priority for them. Don't waste your time ordering delivery from this location.

When I arrived, the employees at the front counter said they didn't have my order. I asked them to double check, and they said it wasn't there. They then said that if I wanted them to make it, I would have to wait another 15 minutes - time which I did not have. So I left the store, and later called the manager on my towards work. I let him know what had happened, that I was a regular customer, and that I was disappointed with the service, and, as a long-time patron, would appreciate some kind of gesture of good will on their end.\n\nThe manager then said he sees my order in the store, and says that it's my fault for not seeking him out directly and asking him. He then starts to get upset, and complains that now he has an order that no one will eat and suggests that I owe 'him'. \n\nI advise anyone to take this story into consideration, as you risk being subject to the same unprofessional treatment from the employees and managers alike.", "author": "Yanik J."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-15", "description": "The bagels are decent, We go there because it's literally around the corner from our house. Went in this morning and ordered two breakfast bagels and two iced hazelnut coffees. We ended up waiting over 25 minutes for our order. When we inquired about our order they asked what it was we ordered which indicates to me they had lost the ticket but then told me they dropped the bagel which was the reason it was taking so long either way s**t happens that's not why I'm upset. I'm upset because as a restaurant owner myself this situation was handled appallingly. Even after I had stood at the counter clearly upset after waiting that long, after they admitted they had made a mistake they still rung us up for our two bagels and two iced coffees. I reminded the guy who seemed to be in charge (the one who told me they had dropped our bagels) of our wait time and he told me \"everyone's waiting.\" I said you can't even throw in the coffees?

Still new to Fort Greene and I know I should be exploring a bit more, but my old man always told me that if you find something great you need to hold it close.

Everything's fresh, and the service is quick and efficient. At first I was a bit confused by the ordering process, but I have a tendency to overthink things, so you can understand how I might get confused by something as simple as two lines, one designated \"order here\" and the other \"wait here\".

They know how to make a mean sandwich. \n\nSince I'm new to the area, I went on the hunt for a nice spot for lunch. La Bagel Delight was the first place I ventured into. It's not too big, there's not much seating yet they really bring in the crowds. It's always busy when I visit. They may be a bit on the pricey side, but I think it's completely worth considering the quality of the foods there. \n\nOne item I want to highlight: Their flagel. It's probably the best one I've had so far in BK. I like mine toasted with light veggie cream cheese. That and some OJ? Best breakfast.\n\nAnd in the last few visits I've had the opportunity to try their sandwiches. Take a look at the specials board since they usually offer some pretty sweet deals. One of my favorites was their Grilled turkey with brie, sliced granny smith apples and their chipotle mayo on a baguette. It was scrumptious.\n\nThe workers are so friendly and work fastttttt.

Today I took all of my coworker's orders and had a great experience with the person taking my order and charging me for my order. I got the avocado toast (usually around $3-4). Today it was $5, I had no problem with the price but when I got back to work and opened my food, my bread was not toasted, the avocado was not smeared in, and it was not filling. Every time I have gotten avocado toast, there has not been a problem. I went back and spoke to the manager (he's a short Asian man). I told him how unhappy I was with my order and showed him what it looked like. The cashier was empathetic but the manager was so rude. He told me, \"we don't smear the avocado, we don't do guacamole here.\" I also informed him that I come there frequent and spend a fair amount of money for breakfast and it doesn't matter if I ordered guacamole because avocado toast is usually smeared and there were only 5 small slices of avocado smushed into the bread. He was very rude about the whole situation and made me never want to spend a dime in there again. I'm all about customer service and his was very poor. To the owner who hired this manager, I recommend having him go to a customer service training or seminar so he can see how to talk to customers spending their money.
