We were just passing by.  Basically the lady at the counter (whom could barely speak English or understand us) made a mistake and put us down for one too many crepes. When we got the check I mentioned it to her and she adjusted the check.  No problems. Out of no where this other woman storms in and is like \"what's the problem here\". Trying to interrogate me over 1 crepe lol. So I explained what happened... The lady who helped us could barely speak English and that's my fault?? No. I'm not paying $12 for an extra crepe I didn't order. Not to mention it's ridiculous that an owner from a restaurant would make a scene like that in front of other customers.

When ordering we didn't explicitly say we wanted soup (since there was no choice, only minestrone), and for some reason the waitress thought that meant we didn't want it.

The tablecloths may be emblazoned with Eiffel towers but they are made of rough potato sack burlap! Toilets are $2 per use, audacious considering the free public restrooms in the park across the street. We ordered two cokes and a Parisian crepe but instead received two creeps an no cokes, an easy mistake which was hastily corrected, providing us also with a humorous view of the cook's shocked expression when the unserved crepe was returned. The crepe was indeed no crepe, it was unquestionably a blin, a Russian pancake version of the parisian crepe, but I didn't mind, I'll eat anything after all, and it wasn't bad for a blin. I did appreciate the carved carrot garnish sitting atop, it brought a flavor of Asia and I like to be reminded of the east while I dine. \n\nThe decor is a mix of vintage inspiration and home arts and crafts. A little stage sets a scene in the front with a wooden bench flanked with mustard sheer drapes. Beneath sits an ikea chest of drawers decorated simply with a tiny wooden box and a Verizon wireless router, blinking cheerfully. This leads me to believe that they offer wireless service, important for today's Internet savvy customer, indeed I am in fact writing this in the cafe itself, giving an account in almost present time.\n\nThe cheque arrived in a little wooden box, luckily service was included at 15% which saved us doing any maths, I wish more places would do this, I only got a B in arithmetic. This was collected by a little boy who came from nowhere it seemed, I assume this is a family establishment because it is normally surprising to see such young employees in this part of brooklyn. \n\nOverall, a healthy experience and I will certainly come back to sample their $2 toilets.", "author": "Egg F."}, {"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "Horrible dining experience and an obvious tourist trap.
